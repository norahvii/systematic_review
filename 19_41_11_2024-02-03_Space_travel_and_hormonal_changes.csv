0,38245340,"Palmer Station, Antarctica: A ground-based spaceflight analog suitable for validation of biomedical countermeasures for deep space missions.","Astronauts are known to exhibit a variety of immunological alterations during spaceflight including changes in leukocyte distribution and plasma cytokine concentrations, a reduction in T-cell function, and subclinical reactivation of latent herpesviruses. These alterations are most likely due to mission-associated stressors including circadian misalignment, microgravity, isolation, altered nutrition, and increased exposure to cosmic radiation. Some of these stressors may also occur in terrestrial situations. This study sought to determine if crewmembers performing winterover deployment at Palmer Station, Antarctica, displayed similar immune alterations. The larger goal was to validate a ground analog suitable for the evaluation of countermeasures designed to protect astronauts during future deep space missions. For this pilot study, plasma, saliva, hair, and health surveys were collected from Palmer Station, Antarctica, winterover participants at baseline, and at five winterover timepoints. Twenty-six subjects consented to participate over the course of two seasons. Initial sample processing was performed at Palmer, and eventually stabilized samples were returned to the Johnson Space Center for analysis. A white blood cell differential was performed (real time) using a fingerstick blood sample to determine alterations in basic leukocyte subsets throughout the winterover. Plasma and saliva samples were analyzed for 30 and 13 cytokines, respectively. Saliva was analyzed for cortisol concentration and three latent herpesviruses (DNA by qPCR), EBV, HSV1, and VZV. Voluntary surveys related to general health and adverse clinical events were distributed to participants. It is noteworthy that due to logistical constraints caused by COVID-19, the baseline samples for each season were collected in Punta Arenas, Chile, after long international travel and during isolation. Therefore, the Palmer pre-mission samples may not reflect a true normal 'baseline'. Minimal alterations were observed in leukocyte distribution during winterover. The mean percentage of monocyte concentration elevated at one timepoint. Plasma G-CSF, IL1RA, MCP-1, MIP-1β, TNFα, and VEGF were decreased during at least one winterover timepoint, whereas RANTES was significantly increased. No statistically significant changes were observed in mean saliva cytokine concentrations. Salivary cortisol was substantially elevated throughout the entire winterover compared to baseline. Compared to shedding levels observed in healthy controls (23%), the percentage of participants who shed EBV was higher throughout all winterover timepoints (52-60%). Five subjects shed HSV1 during at least one timepoint throughout the season compared to no subjects shedding during pre-deployment. Finally, VZV reactivation, common in astronauts but exceptionally rare in ground-based stress analogs, was observed in one subject during pre-deployment and a different subject at WO2 and WO3. These pilot data, somewhat influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, do suggest that participants at Palmer Station undergo immunological alterations similar to, but likely in reduced magnitude, as those observed in astronauts. We suggest that winterover at Palmer Station may be a suitable test analog for spaceflight biomedical countermeasures designed to mitigate clinical risks for deep space missions.","['Antarctica', 'Immunity', 'Microgravity', 'Space']",Life sciences in space research,2024-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Diak', 'firstname': 'Douglass M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Aegis Aerospace, Houston, TX, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Krieger', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'KBR, Houston, Texas, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Gutierrez', 'firstname': 'Cody', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'JES Tech, Houston, Texas, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Satish', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'JES Tech, Houston, Texas, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelman-Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Mayra', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'KBR, Houston, Texas, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Babiak-Vazquez', 'firstname': 'Adriana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aegis Aerospace, Houston, TX, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Young', 'firstname': 'Millennia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Oswald', 'firstname': 'Thomas M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'KBR, Houston, Texas, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Choukér', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LUM), Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Jamee', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'National Science Foundation, Alexandria, Virginia, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'James', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'National Science Foundation, Alexandria, Virginia, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Cindy Y', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'National Science Foundation, Alexandria, Virginia, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Crucian', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, United States.

16313354",Space nutrition and the biochemical changes caused in Astronauts Health due to space flight: A review.,"Astronauts required food that is healthy, nutritious, and tasted good, while also meeting their dietary needs. To ensure the astronauts' nutritional needs are met, a Nutritional Status Assessment Supplemental Medical Objective (Nutrition SMO) is conducted. This involves collecting blood and urine samples from the astronauts, which are then tested and analysed. The assessment looks for indications of bone health, muscle loss, hormonal imbalances, gastrointestinal functions, cardiovascular health, iron metabolism, ophthalmic changes, and immune changes that occur during space flight under conditions of microgravity or weightlessness. It was discovered that iron levels in astronauts tend to increase due to the decrease in body volume during space flight. It requires skilful optimization considering nutrient delivery, shelf life, and packaging of space food, while minimizing resource usage and ensuring reliability, safety, and addressing the physiological and psychological effects on the crew members.","['Gastrointestinal functions', 'Hormonal imbalances', 'Nutrition SMO', 'Ophthalmic changes', 'Oxidative stress']",Food chemistry: X,2023-12-25,"[{'lastname': 'Dakkumadugula', 'firstname': 'Angel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Food Science and Technology, Department of Food Technology, Faculty of Life and Allied Health Sciences, Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences, Bangalore 560054, Karnataka, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Pankaj', 'firstname': 'Lakshaa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Food Science and Technology, Department of Food Technology, Faculty of Life and Allied Health Sciences, Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences, Bangalore 560054, Karnataka, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Alqahtani', 'firstname': 'Ali S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Medicinal Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ullah', 'firstname': 'Riaz', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Medicinal Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ercisli', 'firstname': 'Sezai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey.\nHGF Agro, Ata Teknokent, TR-25240, Erzurum, Turkiye.'}, {'lastname': 'Murugan', 'firstname': 'Rajadurai', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Technology, Faculty of Life and Allied Health Sciences, Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences, Bangalore 560054, Karnataka, India.'}]",,,,© 2023 The Author(s).,"10.1016/j.fochx.2023.100875

11846609",Lost in Space? Unmasking the T Cell Reaction to Simulated Space Stressors.,"The space environment will expose astronauts to stressors like ionizing radiation, altered gravity fields and elevated cortisol levels, which pose a health risk. Understanding how the interplay between these stressors changes T cells' response is important to better characterize space-related immune dysfunction. We have exposed stimulated Jurkat cells to simulated space stressors (1 Gy, carbon ions/1 Gy photons, 1 µM hydrocortisone (HC), Mars, moon, and microgravity) in a single or combined manner. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-2 was measured in the supernatant of Jurkat cells and at the mRNA level. Results show that alone, HC, Mars gravity and microgravity significantly decrease IL-2 presence in the supernatant. 1 Gy carbon ion irradiation showed a smaller impact on IL-2 levels than photon irradiation. Combining exposure to different simulated space stressors seems to have less immunosuppressive effects. Gene expression was less impacted at the time-point collected. These findings showcase a complex T cell response to different conditions and suggest the importance of elevated cortisol levels in the context of space flight, also highlighting the need to use simulated partial gravity technologies to better understand the immune system's response to the space environment.","['altered gravity', 'space radiobiology', 'stress immunity']",International journal of molecular sciences,2023-12-09,"[{'lastname': 'Miranda', 'firstname': 'Silvana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Radiobiology Unit, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, 2400 Mol, Belgium.\nDepartment of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Vermeesen', 'firstname': 'Randy', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Radiobiology Unit, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, 2400 Mol, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Radstake', 'firstname': 'Wilhelmina E', 'initials': 'WE', 'affiliation': 'Radiobiology Unit, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, 2400 Mol, Belgium.\nDepartment of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Parisi', 'firstname': 'Alessio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Radiation Protection Dosimetry and Calibration Expert Group, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK CEN), 2400 Mol, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivanova', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Data Science Institute (DSI), I-BioStat University of Hasselt, 3590 Hasselt, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Baatout', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Radiobiology Unit, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, 2400 Mol, Belgium.\nDepartment of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Tabury', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Radiobiology Unit, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, 2400 Mol, Belgium.\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering and Computing, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baselet', 'firstname': 'Bjorn', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Radiobiology Unit, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, 2400 Mol, Belgium.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms242316943

In this study, we summarize the changes in biological characteristics such as morphology, ovarian development, reproduction, and flight capability during the seasonal migration of the insect. In consideration of global research work, the interaction between flight and reproduction, the influence and regulation of the insulin-like and juvenile hormone on the flight and reproductive activities of migrating insects, and the types of energy substances, metabolic processes, and hormone regulation processes during insect flight are elaborated. This systematic review of the latest advances in the studies on insect migration biology and energy metabolism will help readers to better understand the biological behavior and regulation mechanism of the energy metabolism of insect migration.","['energy substances', 'flight and reproduction', 'insect migration', 'juvenile hormone']",Metabolites,2023-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiaokang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China.\nGuangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Guangzhou 510640, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Kongming', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/metabo13030439

4,36682823,"Comprehensive analyses of plant hormones in etiolated pea and maize seedlings grown under microgravity conditions in space: Relevance to the International Space Station experiment ""Auxin Transport"".","Functional relationships between endogenous levels of plant hormones in the growth and development of shoots in etiolated Alaska pea and etiolated Golden Cross Bantam maize seedlings under different gravities were investigated in the ""Auxin Transport"" experiment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Comprehensive analyses of 31 species of plant hormones of pea and maize seedlings grown under microgravity (μg) in space and 1 g conditions were conducted. Principal component analysis (PCA) and a multiple regression analysis with the dataset from the plant hormone analysis of the etiolated pea seedlings grown under μg and 1 g conditions in the presence and absence of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) revealed endogenous levels of auxin correlated positively with bending and length of epicotyls. Endogenous cytokinins correlated negatively with them. These results suggest an interaction of auxin and cytokinins in automorphogenesis and growth inhibition of etiolated Alaska pea epicotyls grown under μg conditions in space. Less polar auxin transport with reduced endogenous levels of auxin increased endogenous levels of cytokinins, resulting in changing the growth direction of epicotyls and inhibiting growth. On the other hand, almost no close relationship between endogenous plant hormone levels and growth and development in etiolated maize seedlings grown was observed under μg conditions in space, as per Schulze et al. (1992). However, endogenous levels of IAA in the seedlings grown under μg conditions in space were significantly higher than those grown on Earth, similar to the cases of polar auxin transport already reported.","['Automorphogenesis', 'Auxin', 'Cytokinin', 'International space station (ISS) experiment', 'Plant hormone interaction', 'Principal component analysis']",Life sciences in space research,2023-01-23,"[{'lastname': 'Yamazaki', 'firstname': 'Chiaki', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, 2-1-1 Sengen, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8505, Japan.

36269562",Topical corticosteroids for dry eye.,"Dry eye disease (DED), arising from various etiologic factors, leads to tear film instability, ocular surface damage, and neurosensory changes. DED causes symptoms such as ocular dryness, burning, itching, pain, and visual impairment. Given their well-established anti-inflammatory effects, topical steroid preparations have been widely used as a short-term treatment option for DED. Because of potential risks of ocular hypertension, cataracts, and infections associated with the long-term use of topical steroids, published trials comparing the efficacy and safety of topical steroids (versus placebo) have mostly been of short duration (three to eight weeks).
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids compared with no treatment, placebo, other steroidal or non-steroidal therapies, or a combination of therapies for DED.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), without restriction on language or year of publication. The date of the last search was 20 August 2021.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which topical corticosteroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, were compared with no treatment, artificial tears (AT), vehicles, AT plus tobramycin, or cyclosporine A (CsA).
We applied standard Cochrane methodology.
We identified 22 RCTs conducted in the USA, Italy, Spain, China, South Korea, and India. These RCTs reported outcome data from a total of 4169 participants with DED.  Study characteristics and risk of bias All trials recruited adults aged 18 years or older, except one trial that enrolled children and adolescents aged between 3 and 14 years. Half of these trials involved predominantly female participants (median 79%, interquartile range [IQR] 76% to 80%). On average, each trial enrolled 86 participants (IQR 40 to 158). The treatment duration of topical steroids ranged between one week and three months; trial duration lasted between one week and six months. Eight trials were sponsored exclusively by industry, and four trials were co-sponsored by industry and institutional or governmental funds. We assessed the risk of bias of both subjective and objective outcomes using RoB 2, finding nearly half of the trials to be at high risk of bias associated with selective outcome reporting. Findings Of the 22 trials, 16 evaluated effects of topical steroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, as compared with lubricants (AT, vehicle), AT plus tobramycin, or no treatment. Corticosteroids probably have a small to moderate effect on improving patient-reported symptoms by 0.29 standardized mean difference (SMD) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.42) as compared with lubricants (moderate certainty evidence). Topical steroids also likely have a small to moderate effect on lowering corneal staining scores by 0.4 SMDs (95% CI 0.18 to 0.62) (moderate certainty evidence). However, steroids may increase tear film break-up time (TBUT) slightly (mean difference [MD] 0.70 s, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.34; low certainty evidence) but not tear osmolarity (MD 1.60 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -10.47 to 13.67; very low certainty evidence).  Six trials examined topical steroids, either alone or in combination with CsA, against CsA alone. Low certainty evidence indicates that steroid-based interventions may have a small to moderate effect on improving participants' symptoms (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.15), but little to no effect on corneal staining scores (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.35) as compared with CsA. The effect of topical steroids compared to CsA alone on TBUT (MD 0.37 s, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.87) or tear osmolarity (MD 5.80 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -0.94 to 12.54; loteprednol etabonate alone) is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. None of the included trials reported on quality of life scores. Adverse effects The evidence for adverse ocular effects of topical corticosteroids is very uncertain. Topical corticosteroids may increase participants' risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio [RR] 5.96, 95% CI 1.30 to 27.38) as compared with lubricants. However, when compared with CsA, steroids alone or combined with CsA may decrease or increase IOP elevation (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.33). It is also uncertain whether topical steroids may increase risk of cataract formation when compared with lubricants (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.22), given the short-term use and study duration (four weeks or less) to observe longer-term adverse effects.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence for the specified review outcomes was of moderate to very low certainty, mostly due to high risk of bias associated with selective results reporting. For dry eye patients whose symptoms require anti-inflammatory control, topical corticosteroids probably provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond lubricants, and may provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond CsA. However, the current evidence is less certain about the effects of steroids on improved tear film quality or quantity. The available evidence is also very uncertain regarding the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids on IOP elevation or cataract formation or progression. Future trials should generate high certainty evidence to inform physicians and patients of the optimal treatment strategies with topical corticosteroids in terms of regimen (types, formulations, dosages), duration, and its time-dependent adverse profile.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2022-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Su-Hsun', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saldanha', 'firstname': 'Ian J', 'initials': 'IJ', 'affiliation': 'Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health, Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abraham', 'firstname': 'Alison G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rittiphairoj', 'firstname': 'Thanitsara', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hauswirth', 'firstname': 'Scott', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gregory', 'firstname': 'Darren', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ifantides', 'firstname': 'Cristos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Tianjing', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

27050976",Effects of space flight on sperm function and integrity: A systematic review.,"With the advancement in space exploration and the intention to establish an inhabitable human settlement on Mars, it is important to investigate the effects of exposure to space/microgravity and the associated radiations on procreation. Sperm function and integrity are fundamental to male reproduction and can potentially be affected by the environmental changes experienced in space. Therefore, this study was conducted to systematically gather, filter, and collate all the relevant information on the effects of spaceflight on male reproductive parameters and functions. A search was performed utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were extracted from the major electronic databases including PubMed, and other credible literature sources. MeSH search terms that were employed included ""spermatozoa"", ""microgravity"", and ""ionizing radiation"". The literature search did not discriminate against papers published before a certain date due to the very limited number of articles available. However, there was a restriction on the male gender and language (English). The parameters included in this study are sperm motility, total sperm count, sperm DNA fragmentation hormonal levels and testicular histology. Following a comprehensive literature search, a total of 273 articles were retrieved and screened, 252 articles were excluded due to the irrelevance to the topic, duplication, and non-original articles. A total of 21 articles met the inclusion criteria and are included in the current study. Findings from these studies showed that sperm motility was decreased after exposure to microgravity and ionizing radiation. Total sperm count was also found to be reduced by microgravity only. Sperm DNA fragmentation was increased by both ionizing radiation and microgravity. Testosterone levels and testicular weight were also decreased by microgravity. Although there is a dearth in the literature regarding the effects of microgravity and ionizing radiation on male reproductive parameters, the available findings showed that exposure to microgravity poses a risk to male reproductive health. Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures to either manage, treat, or prevent these consequential adverse effects. Hence, this review also highlights some potential countermeasure approaches that may mitigate the harmful effects of microgravity and associated exposures on male reproductive health.","['countermeasures', 'ionizing radiation', 'male fertility', 'microgravity', 'spaceflight', 'sperm function']",Frontiers in physiology,2022-08-30,"[{'lastname': 'Ahrari', 'firstname': 'Khulood', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Omolaoye', 'firstname': 'Temidayo S', 'initials': 'TS', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Goswami', 'firstname': 'Nandu', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nGravitational Physiology and Medicine Research Unit, Division of Physiology, Otto Loewi Research Center of Vascular Biology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Alsuwaidi', 'firstname': 'Hanan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'du Plessis', 'firstname': 'Stefan S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nDivision of Medical Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Tygerberg, South Africa.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Ahrari, Omolaoye, Goswami, Alsuwaidi and du Plessis.","10.3389/fphys.2022.904375

34829886","Chronic Circadian Disruption and Sleep Restriction Influence Subjective Hunger, Appetite, and Food Preference.","Chronic circadian disruption (CCD), such as occurs during rotating shiftwork, and insufficient sleep are each independently associated with poor health outcomes, including obesity and glucose intolerance. A potential mechanism for poor health is increased energy intake (i.e., eating), particularly during the circadian night, when the physiological response to energy intake is altered. However, the contributions of CCD and insufficient sleep to subjective hunger, appetite, food preference, and appetitive hormones are not clear. To disentangle the influences of these factors, we studied seventeen healthy young adults in a 32-day in-laboratory study designed to distribute sleep, wakefulness, and energy intake equally across all phases of the circadian cycle, thereby imposing CCD.

18815039",NAIAD-2020: Characteristics of Motor Evoked Potentials After 3-Day Exposure to Dry Immersion in Women.,"As female astronauts participate in space flight more and more frequently, there is a demand for research on how the female body adapts to the microgravity environment. In particular, there is very little research on how the neuromuscular system reacts to gravitational unloading in women. We aimed to estimate changes in motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the lower leg muscles in women after 3-day exposure to Dry Immersion (DI), which is one of the most widely used ground models of microgravity. Six healthy female volunteers (mean age 30.17 ± 5.5 years) with a natural menstrual cycle participated in this experiment. MEPs were recorded from the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles twice before DI, on the day of DI completion, and 3 days after DI, during the recovery period. To evoke motor responses, transcranial and trans-spinal magnetic stimulation was applied. We showed that changes in MEP characteristics after DI exposure were different depending on the stimulation site, but were similar for both muscles. For trans-spinal stimulation, MEP thresholds decreased compared to baseline values, and amplitudes, on the contrary, increased, resembling the phenomenon of hypogravitational hyperreflexia. This finding is in line with data observed in other experiments on both male and female participants. MEPs to transcranial stimulation had an opposing dynamic, which may have resulted from the small group size and large inter-subject variability, or from hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. Central motor conduction time remained unchanged, suggesting that pyramidal tract conductibility was not affected by DI exposure. More research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms.","['Dry Immersion', 'NAIAD-2020', 'TMS', 'microgravity', 'support unloading', 'trans-spinal magnetic stimulation']",Frontiers in human neuroscience,2021-12-21,"[{'lastname': 'Nosikova', 'firstname': 'Inna', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Gravitational Physiology of the Sensorimotor System, Institute of Biomedical Problems of Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Riabova', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Gravitational Physiology of the Sensorimotor System, Institute of Biomedical Problems of Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Amirova', 'firstname': 'Liubov', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Gravitational Physiology of the Sensorimotor System, Institute of Biomedical Problems of Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kitov', 'firstname': 'Vladimir', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Gravitational Physiology of the Sensorimotor System, Institute of Biomedical Problems of Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomilovskaya', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Gravitational Physiology of the Sensorimotor System, Institute of Biomedical Problems of Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2021 Nosikova, Riabova, Amirova, Kitov and Tomilovskaya.","10.3389/fnhum.2021.753259

28620354",Induced Torpor as a Countermeasure for Low Dose Radiation Exposure in a Zebrafish Model.,"The development of the Artemis programme with the goal of returning to the moon is spurring technology advances that will eventually take humans to Mars and herald a new era of interplanetary space travel. However, long-term space travel poses unique challenges including exposure to ionising radiation from galactic cosmic rays and potential solar particle events, exposure to microgravity and specific nutritional challenges arising from earth independent exploration. Ionising radiation is one of the major obstacles facing future space travel as it can generate oxidative stress and directly damage cellular structures such as DNA, in turn causing genomic instability, telomere shortening, extracellular-matrix remodelling and persistent inflammation. In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) this can lead to leaky gut syndrome, perforations and motility issues, which impact GIT functionality and affect nutritional status. While current countermeasures such as shielding from the spacecraft can attenuate harmful biological effects, they produce harmful secondary particles that contribute to radiation exposure. We hypothesised that induction of a torpor-like state would confer a radioprotective effect given the evidence that hibernation extends survival times in irradiated squirrels compared to active controls. To test this hypothesis, a torpor-like state was induced in zebrafish using melatonin treatment and reduced temperature, and radiation exposure was administered twice over the course of 10 days. The protective effects of induced-torpor were assessed via RNA sequencing and qPCR of mRNA extracted from the GIT. Pathway and network analysis were performed on the transcriptomic data to characterise the genomic signatures in radiation, torpor and torpor + radiation groups. Phenotypic analyses revealed that melatonin and reduced temperature successfully induced a torpor-like state in zebrafish as shown by decreased metabolism and activity levels. Genomic analyses indicated that low dose radiation caused DNA damage and oxidative stress triggering a stress response, including steroidal signalling and changes to metabolism, and cell cycle arrest. Torpor attenuated the stress response through an increase in pro-survival signals, reduced oxidative stress via the oxygen effect and detection and removal of misfolded proteins. This proof-of-concept model provides compelling initial evidence for utilizing an induced torpor-like state as a potential countermeasure for radiation exposure.","['bioinformatics', 'countermeasure', 'metabolism', 'radiation', 'signalling pathways', 'space', 'temperature', 'torpor', 'transcriptome', 'zebrafish']",Cells,2021-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cahill', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences & Institute for Global Food Security, Queens University Belfast, Belfast BT9 5DL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'da Silveira', 'firstname': 'Willian Abraham', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences & Institute for Global Food Security, Queens University Belfast, Belfast BT9 5DL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Renaud', 'firstname': 'Ludivine', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Williamson', 'firstname': 'Tucker', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences & Institute for Global Food Security, Queens University Belfast, Belfast BT9 5DL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Dongjun', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Overton', 'firstname': 'Ian', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7AE, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Sherine S L', 'initials': 'SSL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hardiman', 'firstname': 'Gary', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences & Institute for Global Food Security, Queens University Belfast, Belfast BT9 5DL, UK.\nDepartment of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/cells10040906

11121213","Influence of Microgravity on Apoptosis in Cells, Tissues, and Other Systems In Vivo and In Vitro.","All life forms have evolved under the constant force of gravity on Earth and developed ways to counterbalance acceleration load. In space, shear forces, buoyance-driven convection, and hydrostatic pressure are nullified or strongly reduced. When subjected to microgravity in space, the equilibrium between cell architecture and the external force is disturbed, resulting in changes at the cellular and sub-cellular levels (e.g., cytoskeleton, signal transduction, membrane permeability, etc.). Cosmic radiation also poses great health risks to astronauts because it has high linear energy transfer values that evoke complex DNA and other cellular damage. Space environmental conditions have been shown to influence apoptosis in various cell types. Apoptosis has important functions in morphogenesis, organ development, and wound healing. This review provides an overview of microgravity research platforms and apoptosis. The sections summarize the current knowledge of the impact of microgravity and cosmic radiation on cells with respect to apoptosis. Apoptosis-related microgravity experiments conducted with different mammalian model systems are presented. Recent findings in cells of the immune system, cardiovascular system, brain, eyes, cartilage, bone, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas, as well as cancer cells investigated under real and simulated microgravity conditions, are discussed. This comprehensive review indicates the potential of the space environment in biomedical research.","['apoptosis', 'astronauts', 'cells', 'cosmic radiation', 'mice', 'microgravity', 'rats', 'spaceflight', 'tissues']",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-12-16,"[{'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'Binod', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Gravitational Biology Group, Department of Biology, Friedrich-Alexander University, Staudtstraße 5, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Grimm', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Høegh-Guldbergsgade 10, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.\nDepartment of Microgravity and Translational Regenerative Medicine, Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto von Guericke University, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany.\nResearch Group ""Magdeburger Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Forschung unter Raumfahrt- und Schwerelosigkeitsbedingungen"" (MARS), Otto von Guericke University, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Strauch', 'firstname': 'Sebastian M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Health and Environment, University of Joinville Region, Rua Paulo Malschitzki, 10 - Zona Industrial Norte, Joinville, SC 89219-710, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Erzinger', 'firstname': 'Gilmar Sidnei', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Health and Environment, University of Joinville Region, Rua Paulo Malschitzki, 10 - Zona Industrial Norte, Joinville, SC 89219-710, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Corydon', 'firstname': 'Thomas J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Høegh-Guldbergsgade 10, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens Blvd. 99, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Lebert', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Gravitational Biology Group, Department of Biology, Friedrich-Alexander University, Staudtstraße 5, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.\nSpace Biology Unlimited SAS, 24 Cours de l'Intendance, 33000 Bordeaux, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Magnusson', 'firstname': 'Nils E', 'initials': 'NE', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes and Hormone Diseases, Medical Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Palle Juul-Jensens Boulevard 165, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Infanger', 'firstname': 'Manfred', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microgravity and Translational Regenerative Medicine, Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto von Guericke University, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany.\nResearch Group ""Magdeburger Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Forschung unter Raumfahrt- und Schwerelosigkeitsbedingungen"" (MARS), Otto von Guericke University, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Richter', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Gravitational Biology Group, Department of Biology, Friedrich-Alexander University, Staudtstraße 5, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krüger', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microgravity and Translational Regenerative Medicine, Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto von Guericke University, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany.\nResearch Group ""Magdeburger Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Forschung unter Raumfahrt- und Schwerelosigkeitsbedingungen"" (MARS), Otto von Guericke University, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms21249373

14671324",Targeting myostatin/activin A protects against skeletal muscle and bone loss during spaceflight.,"Among the physiological consequences of extended spaceflight are loss of skeletal muscle and bone mass. One signaling pathway that plays an important role in maintaining muscle and bone homeostasis is that regulated by the secreted signaling proteins, myostatin (MSTN) and activin A. Here, we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the effect of targeting MSTN/activin A signaling in mice that were sent to the International Space Station.

12,32718685,Proteomic analysis in different development stages on SP0 generation of rice seeds after space flight.,"The space biological effects of plants will drive the development of aerospace science and breeding science. The aim of this study is to reveal changes in the proteome of contemporary plants at different growth and development stages after space flight of rice seeds. We carried the rice seeds (DN416) through the SJ-10 returning satellite and returned to the ground for planting to the three-leaf stage (TLP) and tillering stage (TS) after a 12.5-day orbital flight. We found that the space flight caused the rice germination rate, the TLP plant height, and the number of tillers in the TS decreased by 11.64%, 9.75%, and 9.80%, respectively. In addition, the treatment group ROS and MDA level increased in the TLP and TS. The abundance patterns of proteins in these leaves identified 214 proteins in the TLP and 286 in the TS leaves that were markedly changed. Moreover, our study identified D14 proteins that control plant height and tiller. Our results show that the space environment may affect the downstream signaling mechanism by regulating the level of ROS in the body to achieve a response to the space environment. Meanwhile, the space environment may affect the plant height and tiller of rice by altering the expression of D14 protein and hormone-regulated proteins. Our results reveal changes in the proteome of different growth stages of rice plants, and also reveal the molecular mechanism of space environment regulation of rice plant height and tiller, which provides a new direction for further understanding of space biological effects and space mutation breeding.","['Proteomic', 'Rice', 'SJ-10 returning satellite', 'space flight']",Life sciences in space research,2020-07-29,"[{'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Deyong', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150000, China; National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Synthesis, Transformation and Separation of Extreme Environmental Nutrients, Harbin 150001, China.

25132454",Herpes Virus Reactivation in Astronauts During Spaceflight and Its Application on Earth.,"Latent herpes virus reactivation has been demonstrated in astronauts during shuttle (10-16 days) and International Space Station (≥180 days) flights. Following reactivation, viruses are shed in the body fluids of astronauts. Typically, shedding of viral DNA is asymptomatic in astronauts regardless of mission duration; however, in some cases, live/infectious virus was recovered by tissue culture that was associated with atopic-dermatitis or skin lesions during and after spaceflight. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes activation during spaceflight occurs as indicated by increased levels of stress hormones including cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These changes, along with a decreased cell mediated immunity, contribute to the reactivation of latent herpes viruses in astronauts. Currently, 47/89 (53%) astronauts from shuttle-flights and 14/23 (61%) astronauts from ISS missions shed one or more herpes viruses in saliva/urine samples. Astronauts shed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and herpes-simplex-1 (HSV-1) in saliva and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in urine. Larger quantities and increased frequencies for these viruses were found during spaceflight as compared to before or after flight samples and their matched healthy controls. The shedding did not abate during the longer ISS missions, but rather increased in frequency and amplitude. These findings coincided with the immune system dysregulation observed in astronauts from shuttle and ISS missions. VZV shedding increased from 41% in space shuttle to 65% in ISS missions, EBV increased 82 to 96%, and CMV increased 47 to 61%. In addition, VZV/CMV shed ≤30 days after ISS in contrast to shuttle where VZV/CMV shed up to 5 and 3 days after flight respectively. Continued shedding of infectious-virus post-flight may pose a potential risk for crew who may encounter newborn infants, sero-negative adults or any immunocompromised individuals on Earth. Therefore, developing spaceflight countermeasures to prevent viral reactivation is essential. Our spaceflight-developed technologies for saliva collection/rapid viral detection have been extended to include clinical applications including zoster patients, chicken pox, post-herpetic neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, and various neurological disorders. These protocols are employed in various clinics and hospitals including the CDC and Columbia University in New York, as well as overseas in Switzerland and Israel.","['herpes', 'immunity', 'latency', 'spaceflight', 'viral reactivation']",Frontiers in microbiology,2019-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Rooney', 'firstname': 'Bridgette V', 'initials': 'BV', 'affiliation': 'GeoControl Systems, Inc., Houston, TX, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Crucian', 'firstname': 'Brian E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': 'NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Pierson', 'firstname': 'Duane L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Laudenslager', 'firstname': 'Mark L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Satish K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Jes Tech, KBR Wyle Laboratories Houston, Houston, TX, United States.'}]",,,,,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.00016

24469811",Effects of skeletal unloading on the antibody repertoire of tetanus toxoid and/or CpG treated C57BL/6J mice.,"Spaceflight affects the immune system, but the effects on the antibody repertoire, responsible for humoral immunity, has not been well explored. In particular, the complex gene assembly and expression process; including mutations, might make this process vulnerable. Complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), composed of parts of the V-(D-)J-gene segments, is very important for antigen binding and can be used as an important measure of variability. Skeletal unloading, and the physiological effects of it, parallel many impacts of space flight. Therefore, we explored the impact of skeletal unloading using the antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) model. Animals were experimentally challenged with tetanus toxoid (TT) and/or the adjuvant CpG. Blood was analyzed for anti-TT antibody and corticosterone concentrations. Whole spleen tissue was prepared for repertoire characterization. AOS animals showed higher levels of corticosterone levels, but AOS alone did not affect anti-TT serum antibody levels. Administration of CpG significantly increased the circulating anti-TT antibody concentrations. AOS did alter constant gene usage resulting in higher levels of IgM and lower levels of IgG. CpG also altered constant gene region usage increasing usage of IgA. Significant changes could be detected in multiple V-, D-, and J-gene segments in both the heavy and light chains in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatments. Analysis of class-switched only transcripts revealed a different pattern of V-gene segment usage than detected in the whole repertoire and also showed significant alterations in gene segment usage after challenge. Alterations in V/J pairing were also detected in response to challenge. CDR3 amino acid sequence overlaps were similar among treatment groups, though the addition of CpG lowered overlap in the heavy chain. We isolated 3,045 whole repertoire and 98 potentially TT-specific CDR3 sequences for the heavy chain and 569 for the light chain. Our results demonstrate that AOS alters the repertoire response to challenge with TT and/or CpG.",[],PloS one,2019-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Rettig', 'firstname': 'Trisha A', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Bye', 'firstname': 'Bailey A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nishiyama', 'firstname': 'Nina C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biomedical Engineering Sciences, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Hlavacek', 'firstname': 'Savannah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Ward', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Pecaut', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biomedical Engineering Sciences, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Chapes', 'firstname': 'Stephen K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, United States of America.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0210284

12538859",Recovery from 6-month spaceflight at the International Space Station: muscle-related stress into a proinflammatory setting.,"The Sarcolab pilot study of 2 crewmembers, investigated before and after a 6-mo International Space Station mission, has demonstrated the substantial muscle wasting and weakness, along with disruption of muscle's oxidative metabolism. The present work aimed at evaluating the pro/anti-inflammatory status in the same 2 crewmembers (A, B). Blood circulating (c-)microRNAs (miRs), c-proteasome, c-mitochondrial DNA, and cytokines were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR or ELISA tests. Time series analysis was performed ( i.e., before flight and after landing) at 1 and 15 d of recovery (R+1 and R+15, respectively). C-biomarkers were compared with an age-matched control population and with 2-dimensional proteomic analysis of the 2 crewmembers' muscle biopsies. Striking differences were observed between the 2 crewmembers at R+1, in terms of inflamma-miRs (c-miRs-21-5p, -126-3p, and -146a-5p), muscle specific (myo)-miR-206, c-proteasome, and IL-6/leptin, thus making the 2 astronauts dissimilar to each other. Final recovery levels of c-proteasome, c-inflamma-miRs, and c-myo-miR-206 were not reverted to the baseline values in crewmember A. In both crewmembers, myo-miR-206 changed significantly after recovery. Muscle biopsy of astronaut A showed an impressive 80% increase of α-1-antitrypsin, a target of miR-126-3p. These results point to a strong stress response induced by spaceflight involving muscle tissue and the proinflammatory setting, where inflamma-miRs and myo-miR-206 mediate the systemic recovery phase after landing.-Capri, M., Morsiani, C., Santoro, A., Moriggi, M., Conte, M., Martucci, M., Bellavista, E., Fabbri, C., Giampieri, E., Albracht, K., Flück, M., Ruoss, S., Brocca, L., Canepari, M., Longa, E., Di Giulio, I., Bottinelli, R., Cerretelli, P., Salvioli, S., Gelfi, C., Franceschi, C., Narici, M., Rittweger, J.

19237447",Effects of Space Flight on Mouse Liver versus Kidney: Gene Pathway Analyses.,"Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.","['CYP4A1', 'Cdkn1a', 'apoptosis', 'gene array', 'gene expression', 'kidney', 'liver', 'microgravity', 'spaceflight', 'transcriptome']",International journal of molecular sciences,2018-12-21,"[{'lastname': 'Hammond', 'firstname': 'Timothy G', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Durham VA Medical Center, Medicine Service Line, Durham, NC 27705, USA. hammondoutofoffice@yahoo.com.\nNephrology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27705, USA. hammondoutofoffice@yahoo.com.\nSpace Policy Institute, Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052, USA. hammondoutofoffice@yahoo.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Allen', 'firstname': 'Patricia L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': 'Durham VA Medical Center, Medicine Service Line, Durham, NC 27705, USA. plallen08@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Birdsall', 'firstname': 'Holly H', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Space Policy Institute, Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052, USA. hhbirdsall@gmail.com.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC 20420, USA. hhbirdsall@gmail.com.\nDepartments of Otorhinolaryngology, Immunology, and Psychiatry, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hhbirdsall@gmail.com.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms19124106

17,30052484,Socioenvironmental stressors encountered during spaceflight partially affect the murine TCR-β repertoire and increase its self-reactivity.,"Spaceflights are known to affect the immune system. In a previous study, we demonstrated that hypergravity exposure during murine development modified 85% of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-β repertoire. In this study, we investigated whether socioenvironmental stressors encountered during space missions affect T lymphopoiesis and the TCR-β repertoire. To address this question, pregnant mice were subjected throughout gestation to chronic unpredictable mild stressors (CUMS), a model used to mimic socioenvironmental stresses encountered during space missions. Then, newborn T lymphopoiesis and the TCR-β repertoire were studied by flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. No change in thymocyte maturation or TCR expression were noted. TCR-β repertoire analysis revealed that 75% of neonate TCR-β sequences resulted from the expression of 3 variable (V)β segments and that this core repertoire was not affected by CUMS. However, the minor repertoire, representing 25% of the global repertoire, was sensitive to CUMS exposure. We also showed that the variable (diversity) joining [V(D)J] recombination process was unlikely to be affected. Finally, we noted that the CUMS neonatal minor repertoire was more self-reactive than the one of control pups. These findings show that socioenvironmental stressors such as those encountered during space missions affect a fraction (25%) of the TCR-β repertoire and that these stressors could increase self-reactivity.-Fonte, C., Kaminski, S., Vanet, A., Lanfumey, L., Cohen-Salmon, C., Ghislin, S., Frippiat, J.-P.

27070589",Thyroid cancer cells in space during the TEXUS-53 sounding rocket mission - The THYROID Project.,"Human follicular thyroid cancer cells (FTC-133) were sent to space via a sounding rocket during the TEXUS-53 mission to determine the impact of short-term microgravity on these cells. To enable cell culture and fixation in real microgravity, an automated experiment container (EC) was constructed. In order to ensure safe cell culture, cell-chambers consisting of polycarbonate (PC) material were used. They were highly biocompatible as proved by measuring cell survival using Annexin V flow cytometry. In the follow-up experiment, FTC-133 cells were sent to space via a sounding rocket and were fixed before and after the microgravity (µg) phase with RNAlater. In addition, cells were tested for reactions on hypergravity (hyper-g) as much as 18 g to determine whether worst case acceleration during launch can have an influence on the cells. We investigated genes belonging to biological processes such as cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, tumor growth, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Pathway analyses revealed central functions of VEGFA and EGF. EGF upregulates aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) which is influencing CASP3. Hyper-g induced a significant up-regulation of TUBB1, VIM, RDX, CAV1, VEGFA and BCL2. FTC-133 cells grown in an automated EC exposed to µg revealed moderate gene expression changes indicating their survival in orbit.",[],Scientific reports,2018-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Kopp', 'firstname': 'Sascha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krüger', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Feldmann', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, Airbus-Allee 1, D-28199, Bremen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Oltmann', 'firstname': 'Hergen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, Airbus-Allee 1, D-28199, Bremen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schütte', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, Airbus-Allee 1, D-28199, Bremen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmitz', 'firstname': 'Burkhard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, Airbus-Allee 1, D-28199, Bremen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bauer', 'firstname': 'Johann', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, D-82152, Martinsried, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulz', 'firstname': 'Herbert', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Cologne Center for Genomics, University of Cologne, D-50931, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Saar', 'firstname': 'Kathrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine, D-13092, Berlin-Buch, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Huebner', 'firstname': 'Norbert', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine, D-13092, Berlin-Buch, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wehland', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nassef', 'firstname': 'Mohamed Zakaria', 'initials': 'MZ', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Melnik', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Meltendorf', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Pediatrics and Neonatology, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Infanger', 'firstname': 'Manfred', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Grimm', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Plastic, Aesthetic and Hand Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany. dgg@biomed.au.dk.\nDepartment of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Wilhelm Meyers Allé 4, DK-8000, Aarhus C, Denmark. dgg@biomed.au.dk.\nGravitational Biology and Translational Regenerative Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Mechanical Engineering, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, D-39120, Magdeburg, Germany. dgg@biomed.au.dk.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-018-28695-1

7491931",Exercise Training Mitigates Multisystem Deconditioning during Bed Rest.,"This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of a new integrated aerobic and resistance exercise training prescription (SPRINT) using two different sets of exercise equipment: a suite of large International Space Station-like exercise equipment similar to what is found on the International Space Station and a single device with aerobic and resistance exercise capability in the spaceflight analog of bed rest (BR).
Subjects (n = 34) completed 70 d of 6° head down tilt BR: 9 were randomized to remain sedentary (CONT), 9 to exercise training using traditional equipment (EX), 8 to exercise using traditional equipment and low-dose testosterone supplementation (ExT), and 8 to exercise using a combined resistance and aerobic flywheel device. Peak aerobic capacity, ventilatory threshold, cardiac morphology and function (echocardiography), muscle mass (magnetic resonance imaging) and strength/power (isokinetic, leg press, and vertical jump), and bone health (bone mineral density, blood and urine bone markers) were assessed before and after BR.
The SPRINT protocol mitigated BR-induced muscle and cardiac deconditioning regardless of the exercise device used. Molecular markers of bone did not change in the CONT or EX groups. Peak aerobic capacity was maintained from pre- to post-BR in all exercise groups similarly, whereas significant declines were observed in the CONT group (~10%). Significant interaction effects between the CONT group and all EX groups were observed for muscle performance including leg press total work, isokinetic upper and lower leg strength, vertical jump power, and maximal jump height as well as muscle size.
This is the first trial to evaluate multisystem deconditioning and the role of an integrated exercise countermeasure. These findings have important implications for the design and implementation of exercise-based countermeasures on future long-duration spaceflight missions.",[],Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2018-06-21,"[{'lastname': 'Ploutz-Snyder', 'firstname': 'Lori L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': 'Universities Space Research Association, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Downs', 'firstname': 'Meghan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Goetchius', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Crowell', 'firstname': 'Brent', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'MEI Technologies, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'English', 'firstname': 'Kirk L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'JES Tech, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Ploutz-Snyder', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Universities Space Research Association, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryder', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Universities Space Research Association, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Dillon', 'firstname': 'Edgar Lichar', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Sheffield-Moore', 'firstname': 'Melinda', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Scott', 'firstname': 'Jessica M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Universities Space Research Association, Houston, TX.'}]",,,"The SPRINT protocol mitigated BR-induced muscle and cardiac deconditioning regardless of the exercise device used.

23636025",Efficacy of Testosterone plus NASA Exercise Countermeasures during Head-Down Bed Rest.,"Prolonged confinement to head-down bed rest (HDBR) results in musculoskeletal losses similar to those observed during long-duration space flight. Exercise countermeasures by themselves have not completely prevented the deleterious losses in muscle mass or function in HDBR or space flight.
The objective was to investigate the safety and efficacy of intermittent, low-dose testosterone treatment in conjunction with NASA exercise (SPRINT) countermeasures during 70 d of 6° HDBR.
Healthy men (35 ± 8 yr) were randomized into one of three groups that remained inactive (CON) or performed exercise 6 d·wk in addition to receiving either placebo (PEX) or testosterone treatment (TEX, 100 mg·wk). Testosterone/placebo injections were administered once a week for 2 wk, followed by 2 wk off and so on, during HDBR.
Total, leg, and trunk lean body mass (LBM) consistently decreased in CON, increased in TEX, and had little or no changes in PEX. Total, leg, and trunk fat mass consistently increased in CON and PEX and decreased in TEX. Leg strength decreased in CON, whereas PEX and TEX were protected against loss in strength. Changes in leg LBM correlated positively with changes in leg muscle strength.
Addition of a testosterone countermeasure enhanced the preventative actions of exercise against body composition changes during long-term HDBR in healthy eugonadal men. This is the first report to demonstrate that cycled, low-dose testosterone treatment increases LBM under conditions of strict exercise control. These results are clinically relevant to the development of safe and effective therapies against muscle atrophy during long-term bed rest, aging, and disease where loss of muscle mass and strength is a risk. The potential space flight applications of such countermeasure combinations deserve further investigations.",[],Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2018-06-21,"[{'lastname': 'Dillon', 'firstname': 'E Lichar', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Sheffield-Moore', 'firstname': 'Melinda', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Durham', 'firstname': 'William J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Ploutz-Snyder', 'firstname': 'Lori L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': 'Universities Space Research Association, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryder', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Universities Space Research Association, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Danesi', 'firstname': 'Christopher P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Randolph', 'firstname': 'Kathleen M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilkison', 'firstname': 'Charles R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Urban', 'firstname': 'Randall J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.'}]",,,"Total, leg, and trunk lean body mass (LBM) consistently decreased in CON, increased in TEX, and had little or no changes in PEX.

20089382","Evaluation of psychological stress in confined environments using salivary, skin, and facial image parameters.","Detecting the influence of psychological stress is particularly important in prolonged space missions. In this study, we determined potential markers of psychological stress in a confined environment. We examined 23 Japanese subjects staying for 2 weeks in a confined facility at Tsukuba Space Center, measuring salivary, skin, and facial image parameters. Saliva was collected at four points in a single day to detect diurnal variation. Increases in salivary cortisol were detected after waking up on the 4th and 11th days, and at 15:30 on the 1st and in the second half of the stay. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and sebum content of the skin were higher compared with outside the facility on the 4th and 1st days respectively. Increased IL-1β in the stripped stratum corneum was observed on the 14th day, and 7 days after leaving. Differences in facial expression symmetry at the time of facial expression changes were observed on 11th and 14th days. Thus, we detected a transition of psychological stress using salivary cortisol profiles and skin physiological parameters. The results also suggested that IL-1β in the stripped stratum corneum and facial expression symmetry are possible novel markers for conveniently detecting psychological stress.",[],Scientific reports,2018-05-31,"[{'lastname': 'Egawa', 'firstname': 'Mariko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan. mariko.egawa@to.shiseido.co.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Haze', 'firstname': 'Shinichiro', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Gozu', 'firstname': 'Yoko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hosoi', 'firstname': 'Junichi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Onodera', 'firstname': 'Tomoko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tojo', 'firstname': 'Yosuke', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Katsuyama', 'firstname': 'Masako', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hara', 'firstname': 'Yusuke', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Katagiri', 'firstname': 'Chika', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Shiseido Global Innovation Center, Yokohama, 224-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Inoue', 'firstname': 'Natsuhiko', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Space Biomedical Research Group, Tsukuba, 305-8505, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Furukawa', 'firstname': 'Satoshi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Space Biomedical Research Group, Tsukuba, 305-8505, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Go', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Space Biomedical Research Group, Tsukuba, 305-8505, Japan.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-018-26654-4

10479650",Is spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction linked to systemic changes in metabolism?,"The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA's Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.",[],PloS one,2017-05-26,"[{'lastname': 'Pecaut', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Sciences, Division of Radiation Research, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Mao', 'firstname': 'Xiao Wen', 'initials': 'XW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Sciences, Division of Radiation Research, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Bellinger', 'firstname': 'Denise L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Jonscher', 'firstname': 'Karen R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Denver, CO, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Stodieck', 'firstname': 'Louis S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'BioServe Space Technologies, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferguson', 'firstname': 'Virginia L', 'initials': 'VL', 'affiliation': 'BioServe Space Technologies, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Bateman', 'firstname': 'Ted A', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohney', 'firstname': 'Robert P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Metabolon, Inc., Morrisville, NC, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Gridley', 'firstname': 'Daila S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Sciences, Division of Radiation Research, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, United States of America.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0174174

We tested the hypothesis that an increase in salt intake of 6 g/d would change fluid balance in men living under ultra-long-term controlled conditions.
Over the course of 2 separate space flight simulation studies of 105 and 205 days' duration, we exposed 10 healthy men to 3 salt intake levels (12, 9, or 6 g/d). All other nutrients were maintained constant. We studied the effect of salt-driven changes in mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid urinary excretion on day-to-day osmolyte and water balance.
A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded well with the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with surplus osmolyte excretion.
Humans regulate osmolyte and water balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, endogenous accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion.

7636184",Decreases in thymopoiesis of astronauts returning from space flight.,"Following the advent of molecular assays that measure T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) present in recent thymic emigrants, it has been conclusively shown that thymopoiesis persists in most adults, but that functional output decreases with age, influencing the maintenance of a diverse and functional T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Space flight has been shown to result in a variety of phenotypic and functional changes in human T cells and in the reactivation of latent viruses. While space flight has been shown to influence thymic architecture in rodents, thymopoiesis has not previously been assessed in astronauts. Here, we assessed thymopoiesis longitudinally over a 1-year period prior to and after long-term space flight (median duration, 184 days) in 16 astronauts. While preflight assessments of thymopoiesis remained quite stable in individual astronauts, we detected significant suppression of thymopoiesis in all subjects upon return from space flight. We also found significant increases in urine and plasma levels of endogenous glucocorticoids coincident with the suppression of thymopoiesis. The glucocorticoid induction and thymopoiesis suppression were transient, and they normalized shortly after return to Earth. This is the first report to our knowledge to prospectively demonstrate a significant change in thymopoiesis in healthy individuals in association with a defined physiologic emotional and physical stress event. These results suggest that suppression of thymopoiesis has the potential to influence the maintenance of the TCR repertoire during extended space travel. Further studies of thymopoiesis and endogenous glucocorticoids in other stress states, including illness, are warranted.",[],JCI insight,2016-10-05,"[{'lastname': 'Benjamin', 'firstname': 'Cara L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Adult Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center, Miami, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stowe', 'firstname': 'Raymond P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Microgen Laboratories, La Marque, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'St John', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sams', 'firstname': 'Clarence F', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Satish K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Jestech, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Crucian', 'firstname': 'Brian E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': 'NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pierson', 'firstname': 'Duane L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Komanduri', 'firstname': 'Krishna V', 'initials': 'KV', 'affiliation': 'Adult Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center, Miami, Florida, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1172/jci.insight.88787

17917671",Space radiation exposure persistently increased leptin and IGF1 in serum and activated leptin-IGF1 signaling axis in mouse intestine.,"Travel into outer space is fraught with risk of exposure to energetic heavy ion radiation such as (56)Fe ions, which due to its high linear energy transfer (high-LET) characteristics deposits higher energy per unit volume of tissue traversed and thus more damaging to cells relative to low-LET radiation such as γ rays. However, estimates of human health risk from energetic heavy ion exposure are hampered due to lack of tissue specific in vivo molecular data. We investigated long-term effects of (56)Fe radiation on adipokines and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling axis in mouse intestine and colon. Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 1.6 Gy of (56)Fe ions. Serum and tissues were collected up to twelve months post-irradiation. Serum was analyzed for leptin, adiponectin, IGF1, and IGF binding protein 3. Receptor expressions and downstream signaling pathway alterations were studied in tissues. Irradiation increased leptin and IGF1 levels in serum, and IGF1R and leptin receptor expression in tissues. When considered along with upregulated Jak2/Stat3 pathways and cell proliferation, our data supports the notion that space radiation exposure is a risk to endocrine alterations with implications for chronic pathophysiologic changes in gastrointestinal tract.",[],Scientific reports,2016-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Suman', 'firstname': 'Shubhankar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular &Cellular Biology and Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Santosh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular &Cellular Biology and Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fornace', 'firstname': 'Albert J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular &Cellular Biology and Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA.\nCenter of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research (CEGMR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Datta', 'firstname': 'Kamal', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular &Cellular Biology and Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/srep31853

27,26846554,Effects of isolation and confinement on humans-implications for manned space explorations.,"Human psychology and physiology are significantly altered by isolation and confinement. In light of planned exploration class interplanetary missions, the related adverse effects on the human body need to be explored and defined as they have a large impact on a mission's success. Terrestrial space analogs offer an excellent controlled environment to study some of these stressors during a space mission in isolation without the complex environment of the International Space Station. Participants subjected to these space analog conditions can encounter typical symptoms ranging from neurocognitive changes, fatigue, misaligned circadian rhythm, sleep disorders, altered stress hormone levels, and immune modulatory changes. This review focuses on both the psychological and the physiological responses observed in participants of long-duration spaceflight analog studies, such as Mars500 or Antarctic winter-over. They provide important insight into similarities and differences encountered in each simulated setting. The identification of adverse effects from confinement allows not only the crew to better prepare for but also to design feasible countermeasures that will help support space travelers during exploration class missions in the future.","['circadian rhythm', 'immunity', 'psychoneuroendocrinology', 'space analog', 'stress']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2016-02-06,"[{'lastname': 'Pagel', 'firstname': 'J I', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': 'Stress and Immunology Laboratory, Department of Anesthesiology, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Choukèr', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Stress and Immunology Laboratory, Department of Anesthesiology, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany alexander.chouker@med.uni-muenchen.de.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.,10.1152/japplphysiol.00928.2015,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc9d0590>
28,26780604,Reductions in circulating endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels in healthy human subjects exposed to chronic stressors.,"Increasing evidence indicates that chronic stress, such as social isolation, plays an important role in the development of a variety of psychiatric and somatic disorders. Meanwhile, chronic stress imposed by prolonged isolation and confinement in the spacecraft is also one of the major concerns for the health of future interplanetary space travelers. Preclinical studies suggest that the peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) system is involved in the regulation of the stress response and eCB signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases. However, there are only few human studies addressing this topic, of which most focusing on patients who have already developed a certain type of disorder. It remains unknown whether chronic stress may affect eCB signaling in healthy humans. A 520-d isolation and confinement study simulating a flight to Mars provided an extraordinary chance to study the effects of prolonged stress in healthy humans. During the study period, the participants lived in confinement and could not meet their families, friends, or strangers for more than 500 days. We examined the impact of chronic exposure to isolation and confinement through monitoring their psychological state, brain cortical activity, sympathetic adrenal-medullary system response and eCB signaling response. We observed reduced positive emotion ratings, decreased brain cortical activities and high levels of catecholamine release, indicating that prolonged exposure to isolation and confinement stressors may bring about changes both psychologically and physiologically. Importantly, for eCB signaling response, blood concentrations of eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), but not anandamide (AEA), were significantly reduced (p<0.001), suggesting that dysregulation of 2-AG signaling might be specifically implicated in the response to chronic stressors.","['2-Arachidonoylglycerol', 'Chronic stress', 'Endocannabinoid', 'HPA axis', 'N-arachidonylethanolamine']",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2016-01-19,"[{'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'Buqing', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Marchioninistrasse15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.

29,26747504,Increased postflight carotid artery stiffness and inflight insulin resistance resulting from 6-mo spaceflight in male and female astronauts.,"Removal of the normal head-to-foot gravity vector and chronic weightlessness during spaceflight might induce cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations related to changes in arterial pressure and reduction in physical activity. We tested hypotheses that stiffness of arteries located above the heart would be increased postflight, and that blood biomarkers inflight would be consistent with changes in vascular function. Possible sex differences in responses were explored in four male and four female astronauts who lived on the International Space Station for 6 mo. Carotid artery distensibility coefficient (P = 0.005) and β-stiffness index (P = 0.006) reflected 17-30% increases in arterial stiffness when measured within 38 h of return to Earth compared with preflight. Spaceflight-by-sex interaction effects were found with greater changes in β-stiffness index in women (P = 0.017), but greater changes in pulse wave transit time in men (P = 0.006). Several blood biomarkers were changed from preflight to inflight, including an increase in an index of insulin resistance (P < 0.001) with a spaceflight-by-sex term suggesting greater change in men (P = 0.034). Spaceflight-by-sex interactions for renin (P = 0.016) and aldosterone (P = 0.010) indicated greater increases in women than men. Six-month spaceflight caused increased arterial stiffness. Altered hydrostatic arterial pressure gradients as well as changes in insulin resistance and other biomarkers might have contributed to alterations in arterial properties, including sex differences between male and female astronauts.","['arterial stiffness', 'sex differences', 'spaceflight']",American journal of physiology.

4075870",Sex Differences in Mobility and Spatial Cognition: A Test of the Fertility and Parental Care Hypothesis in Northwestern Namibia.,"The fertility and parental care hypothesis interprets sex differences in some spatial-cognitive tasks as an adaptive mechanism to suppress women's travel. In particular, the hypothesis argues that estrogens constrain travel during key reproductive periods by depressing women's spatial-cognitive ability. Limiting travel reduces exposure to the dangers and caloric costs of navigating long distances into unfamiliar environments. Our study evaluates a collection of predictions drawn from the fertility and parental care hypothesis among the Twe and Himba people living in a remote region of Namibia. We find that nursing mothers travel more than women at any other stage of their reproductive career. This challenges the assumption that women limit travel during vulnerable and energetically demanding reproductive periods. In addition, we join previous studies in identifying a relationship between spatial ability and traveling among men, but not women. If spatial ability does not influence travel, hormonally induced changes in spatial ability cannot be used as a mechanism to reduce travel. Instead, it appears the fitness consequences of men's travel is a more likely target for adaptive explanations of the sex differences in spatial ability, navigation, and range size.","['Fertility', 'Mobility', 'Namibia', 'Parental care', 'Sex differences', 'Spatial cognition']","Human nature (Hawthorne, N.Y.)",2015-11-19,"[{'lastname': 'Vashro', 'firstname': 'Layne', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'University of Utah, 270 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA. layne.vashro@anthro.utah.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Padilla', 'firstname': 'Lace', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Utah, 380 S 1530 E Beh S 502, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cashdan', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'University of Utah, 270 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s12110-015-9247-2,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc930d60>
31,26456109,Bone metabolism and renal stone risk during International Space Station missions.,"Bone loss and renal stone risk are longstanding concerns for astronauts. Bone resorption brought on by spaceflight elevates urinary calcium and the risk of renal stone formation. Loss of bone calcium leads to concerns about fracture risk and increased long-term risk of osteoporosis. Bone metabolism involves many factors and is interconnected with muscle metabolism and diet. We report here bone biochemistry and renal stone risk data from astronauts on 4- to 6-month International Space Station missions. All had access to a type of resistive exercise countermeasure hardware, either the Advanced Resistance Exercise Device (ARED) or the Interim Resistance Exercise Device (iRED). A subset of the ARED group also tested the bisphosphonate alendronate as a potential anti-resorptive countermeasure (Bis+ARED). While some of the basic bone marker data have been published, we provide here a more comprehensive evaluation of bone biochemistry with a larger group of astronauts. Regardless of exercise, the risk of renal stone formation increased during spaceflight. A key factor in this increase was urine volume, which was lower during flight in all groups at all time points. Thus, the easiest way to mitigate renal stone risk is to increase fluid consumption. ARED use increased bone formation without changing bone resorption, and mitigated a drop in parathyroid hormone in iRED astronauts. Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived negative regulator of bone formation, increased 10-15% in both groups of astronauts who used the ARED (p<0.06). IGF-1, which regulates bone growth and formation, increased during flight in all 3 groups (p<0.001). Our results are consistent with the growing body of literature showing that the hyper-resorptive state of bone that is brought on by spaceflight can be countered pharmacologically or mitigated through an exercise-induced increase in bone formation, with nutritional support. Key questions remain about the effect of exercise-induced alterations in bone metabolism on bone strength and fracture risk.","['Anti-resorptives', 'Biochemical markers of bone turnover', 'Exercise']",Bone,2015-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Scott M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Human Health and Performance Directorate, NASA Lyndon B.

24524080","Genotype, B-vitamin status, and androgens affect spaceflight-induced ophthalmic changes.","Ophthalmic changes have occurred in a subset of astronauts on International Space Station missions. Visual deterioration is considered the greatest human health risk of spaceflight. Affected astronauts exhibit higher concentrations of 1-carbon metabolites (e.g., homocysteine) before flight. We hypothesized that genetic variations in 1-carbon metabolism genes contribute to susceptibility to ophthalmic changes in astronauts. We investigated 5 polymorphisms in the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) genes and their association with ophthalmic changes after flight in 49 astronauts. The number of G alleles of MTRR 66 and C alleles of SHMT1 1420 both contributed to the odds of visual disturbances. Preflight dehydroepiandrosterone was positively associated with cotton wool spots, and serum testosterone response during flight was associated with refractive change. Block regression showed that B-vitamin status and genetics were significant predictors of many of the ophthalmic outcomes that we observed. In one example, genetics trended toward improving (P = 0.10) and B-vitamin status significantly improved (P < 0.001) the predictive model for refractive change after flight. We document an association between MTRR 66 and SHMT1 1420 polymorphisms and spaceflight-induced vision changes.

7586978",Effect of calcitriol supplementation and tail suspension on serum biomarkers of bone formation in rats.,"Calcitriol is documented to cause significant increase in bone mass densitometry counteracting osteoporosis. Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats.
This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period. We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats (>200 gr, >6 week) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model. Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period. The results were analyzed and compared between groups.
Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups, their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group. The levels of these biomarkers were lower in those who were submitted to tail suspension model and received calcitriol supplementation compared to those who were only submitted to tail suspension (60.14 ± 11.73 ng/mL vs. 58.29 ± 2.69 ng/mL; p = 0.696 for osteocalcin and 381.86 ± 99.16 mU/mL vs. 362.57 ± 27.41 ng/mL; p = 0.635 for alkaline phosphatase).
Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium. This pattern of change in biomarkers of bone formation, may point to the capacity of calcitriol supplementation in preventing cellular process of osteoporosis. Thus calcitriol supplementation could be an available, economic and effective strategy for preventing bone metabolic changes related to weightlessness commonly encountered in space flight. The outcome of this study needs to be further studied in future trying to find more definite results.","['Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)', 'Calcitriol', 'Osteocalcin (OC)', 'Tail suspension model', 'Vitamin D']",Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders,2015-03-26,"[{'lastname': 'Hashemian', 'firstname': 'Seyed Jafar', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Science Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Rismanchi', 'firstname': 'Mojtaba', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Esfahani', 'firstname': 'Ensiyeh Nasli', 'initials': 'EN', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Science Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Khoshvaghti', 'firstname': 'Amir', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Aerospace and Sub-Aquatic Medicine, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Razi', 'firstname': 'Farideh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Science Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}]",,"Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium.

34,25678697,Functional changes in neutrophils and psychoneuroendocrine responses during 105 days of confinement.,"The innate immune system as one key element of immunity and a prerequisite for an adequate host defense is of emerging interest in space research to ensure crew health and thus mission success. In ground-based studies, spaceflight-associated specifics such as confinement caused altered immune functions paralleled by changes in stress hormone levels. In this study, six men were confined for 105 days to a space module of ~500 m(3) mimicking conditions of a long-term space mission. Psychic stress was surveyed by different questionnaires. Blood, saliva, and urine samples were taken before, during, and after confinement to determine quantitative and qualitative immune responses by analyzing enumerative assays and quantifying microbicide and phagocytic functions. Additionally, expression and shedding of L-selectin (CD62L) on granulocytes and different plasma cytokine levels were measured. Cortisol and catecholamine levels were analyzed in saliva and urine. Psychic stress or an activation of the psychoneuroendocrine system could not be testified. White blood cell counts were not significantly altered, but innate immune functions showed increased cytotoxic and reduced microbicide capabilities. Furthermore, a significantly enhanced shedding of CD62L might be a hint at increased migratory capabilities. However, this was observed in the absence of any acute inflammatory state, and no rise in plasma cytokine levels was detected. In summary, confinement for 105 days caused changes in innate immune functions. Whether these changes result from an alert immune state in preparation for further immune challenges or from a normal adaptive process during confinement remains to be clarified in future research.","['confinement', 'innate immune system', 'spaceflight']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2015-02-14,"[{'lastname': 'Strewe', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;'}, {'lastname': 'Muckenthaler', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;'}, {'lastname': 'Feuerecker', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;'}, {'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;'}, {'lastname': 'Rykova', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation;'}, {'lastname': 'Kaufmann', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Neuperlach Hospital, Municipal Hospital Group, Munich, Germany; and.'}, {'lastname': 'Nichiporuk', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation;'}, {'lastname': 'Vassilieva', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation;'}, {'lastname': 'Hörl', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;'}, {'lastname': 'Matzel', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;'}, {'lastname': 'Schelling', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;'}, {'lastname': 'Thiel', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinic of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Klinikum Mannheim, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Morukov', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation;'}, {'lastname': 'Choukèr', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Klinikum Groβhadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany; alexander.chouker@med.uni-muenchen.de.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.,10.1152/japplphysiol.00755.2014,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc907860>
35,25499619,The impact of chronic stress burden of 520-d isolation and confinement on the physiological response to subsequent acute stress challenge.,"Collective evidence indicates that previous exposure to stressful condition might be able to induce changes in brain structure, HPA axis activity and related neurotransmission, and accordingly affect physiological responses to subsequent challenges. During long-term spaceflight, space travelers have to live under the condition of isolation and confinement in the spacecraft for a long period. It is still largely unknown if this kind of chronic stress burden can induce any long-lasting changes. To address this question, following 520-d isolation and confinement simulating a flight to Mars, the participants and a matched control group were exposed to an acute stress challenge called parabolic flight. Brain cortical activity, HPA axis activity, and sympathetic adrenal-medullary system response were monitored by EEG signal, cortisol secretion, and catecholamine production, respectively. We observed enhanced EEG signals, elevated cortisol levels and increased adrenaline productions. A group effect on cortisol output was revealed showing higher cortisol peak levels in the Mars520 group as compared to the control group, suggesting that HPA axis was to a certain extent more activated in the subjects who had chronic stress experience.","['Chronic stress', 'Cortisol', 'EEG', 'HPA axis activity']",Behavioural brain research,2014-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'Buqing', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anaesthesiology (Research Group Stress and Immunology), Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Munich, Germany.

36,25376832,"Hind limb unloading, a model of spaceflight conditions, leads to decreased B lymphopoiesis similar to aging.","Within the bone marrow, the endosteal niche plays a crucial role in B-cell differentiation. Because spaceflight is associated with osteoporosis, we investigated whether changes in bone microstructure induced by a ground-based model of spaceflight, hind limb unloading (HU), could affect B lymphopoiesis. To this end, we analyzed both bone parameters and the frequency of early hematopoietic precursors and cells of the B lineage after 3, 6, 13, and 21 d of HU. We found that limb disuse leads to a decrease in both bone microstructure and the frequency of B-cell progenitors in the bone marrow. Although multipotent hematopoietic progenitors were not affected by HU, a decrease in B lymphopoiesis was observed as of the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) stage with a major block at the progenitor B (pro-B) to precursor B (pre-B) cell transition (5- to 10-fold decrease). The modifications in B lymphopoiesis were similar to those observed in aged mice and, as with aging, decreased B-cell generation in HU mice was associated with reduced expression of B-cell transcription factors, early B-cell factor (EBF) and Pax5, and an alteration in STAT5-mediated IL-7 signaling. These findings demonstrate that mechanical unloading of hind limbs results in a decrease in early B-cell differentiation resembling age-related modifications in B lymphopoiesis.","['B-cell differentiation', 'bone remodeling', 'gravity', 'immunosenescence']",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2014-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Lescale', 'firstname': 'Chloé', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""*Institut Universitaire d'Hématologie, Université Paris 7 Denis Diderot, Paris, France;

37,25199119,Changes in stress hormones and metabolism during a 105-day simulated Mars mission.,"The Mars-105 project was aimed at simulating crew's activities, workload, and communication during a mission to Mars, evaluating the homeostatic adaptations to prolonged confinement and cohabitation.
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin, C-peptide, leptin, cortisol, and NGF and BDNF plasma levels were monitored in six healthy nonsmoking male subjects taking part in a 105-d Mars mission simulation. Samples were collected from each subject before (0 wk), during (2.5 wk; 5 wk; 10 wk; 15 wk), and after confinement (+1 wk).
Confinement resulted in impaired glucometabolic parameters, since FPG increased during the first 5 wk (baseline: 85.2 ± 10.8 mg · dl⁻¹; 2.5 wk: 98.4 ± 4.7 mg · dl⁻¹; 5 wk: 92.5 ± 6.0 mg · dl⁻¹) and insulin dropped at 2.5 wk (baseline: 14.4 ± 4.8 mU · L⁻¹; 2.5 wk: 7.7 ± 2.1 mU · L⁻¹), subsequently returning to baseline values. HOMA-IR paralleled plasma insulin, dropping to 1.8 ± 0.5 at 2.5 wk (baseline: 3.0 ± 1.2). At all time-points tested, plasma leptin levels were decreased (baseline: 4.4 ± 3.3 ng · dl⁻¹; 2.5 wk: 1.6 ± 1.2 ng · dl⁻¹; 5 wk: 1.3 ± 0.8 ng · dl⁻¹; 10 wk: 1.5 ± 1.1 ng · dl⁻¹; 15 wk:1.7 ± 0.8 ng · dl⁻¹), whereas cortisol levels were increased (baseline: 10.8 ± 4.9 ng · dl⁻¹; 2.5 wk: 16.8 ± 3.5 ng · dl⁻¹; 5 wk: 18.1 ± 7.6 ng · dl⁻¹; 10 wk: 18.1 ± 8.3 ng · dl⁻¹; 15 wk:14.2 ± 4.4 ng · dl⁻¹), resulting in a negative correlation between these hormones. BDNF levels increased only at 5 and 10 wk (baseline: 67.1 ± 36.0 pg · ml⁻¹; 5 wk: 164 ± 54 pg · ml⁻¹; and 10 wk: 110.2 ± 28.9 pg · ml⁻¹).

38,24945896,Reinterpretation of mouse thyroid changes under space conditions: the contribution of confinement to damage.,"During space missions, astronauts work in a state of separation from their daily social environment and in physical confinement. It has been shown that confinement influences mood and brain cortical activity, but no data has been obtained with regard to its effect on the thyroid gland, the structure and function of which change during spaceflights. Here, we report the results of a study on the effects of confinement on mouse thyroid, which was implemented with the Mice Drawer System Facility maintained on the ground, a system used for spaceflight experiments. The results show that confinement changes the microscopic structure of the thyroid gland and that it exhibits symptoms similar to those that result from physiological and/or pathological hyperfunction. What is left unchanged, however, is the sphingomyelinase-thyrotropin receptor relationship, which is important for thyrotropin response with a consequential production of hormones that act on the metabolism of almost all tissues and reduces the production of calcitonin, a hormone involved in bone metabolism. During space missions, the overexpression of pleiotrophin, a widespread cytokine up-regulated after tissue injury that acts on bone remodeling, attenuates changes to the thyroid that are spaceflight-dependent; therefore we studied the thyroids of pleiotrophin-transgenic mice in the Mice Drawer System Facility. In confinement, pleiotrophin overexpression does not protect from the loss of calcitonin. The contribution of confinement to thyroid damage during spaceflights is discussed.",[],Astrobiology,2014-06-20,"[{'lastname': 'Albi', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': '1 Laboratory of Nuclear Lipid BioPathology , CRABiON, Perugia, Italy .'}, {'lastname': 'Ambesi-Impiombato', 'firstname': 'F S', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazzarini', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazzarini', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Floridi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cataldi', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Loreti', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferri', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Curcio', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1089/ast.2014.1166,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc8c2cc0>

Current bone loss mitigation techniques include pharmaceutical interventions, exercise, pulsed ultrasound targeted to bone and whole body vibration. In this study, we attempted to mitigate paralysis-induced bone loss by applying focused ultrasound to the midbelly of a paralyzed muscle. We employed a mouse model of disuse that uses onabotulinumtoxinA-induced paralysis, which causes rapid bone loss in 5 d. A focused 2 MHz transducer applied pulsed exposures with pulse repetition frequency mimicking that of motor neuron firing during walking (80 Hz), standing (20 Hz), or the standard pulsed ultrasound frequency used in fracture healing (1 kHz). Exposures were applied daily to calf muscle for 4 consecutive d. Trabecular bone changes were characterized using micro-computed tomography. Our results indicated that application of certain focused pulsed ultrasound parameters was able to mitigate some of the paralysis-induced bone loss.","['Micro-computed tomography', 'Mitigation of trabecular bone loss', 'Mouse model of disuse', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Paralysis', 'Pulsed focused ultrasound']",Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2014-05-27,"[{'lastname': 'Poliachik', 'firstname': 'Sandra L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Radiology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, USA; Center for Industrial and Medical Ultrasound, Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

40,24704568,520-d Isolation and confinement simulating a flight to Mars reveals heightened immune responses and alterations of leukocyte phenotype.,"During interplanetary exploration, chronic stress caused by long term isolation and confinement in the spacecraft is one of the major concerns of physical and psychological health of space travelers. And for human on Earth, more and more people live in an isolated condition, which has become a common social problem in modern western society. Collective evidences have indicated prolonged chronic stress could bring big influence to human immune function, which may lead to a variety of health problems. However, to what extent long-term isolation can affect the immune system still remains largely unknow. A simulated 520-d Mars mission provided an extraordinary chance to study the effect of prolonged isolation. Six healthy males participated in this mission and their active neuroendocrine and immune conditions were studied with saliva and blood samples from all participants on chosen time points during the isolation period. As a typical neuroendocrine parameter, stress hormone cortisol was measured in the morning saliva samples. Immune phenotype changes were monitored through peripheral leukocyte phenotype analysis. Using an ex vivo viral infection simulation assay we assessed the immune response changes characterized by the ability to produce representative endogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines. The results of this study revealed elevated cortisol levels, increased lymphocyte amount and heightened immune responses, suggesting that prolonged isolation acting as chronic stressors are able to trigger leukocyte phenotype changes and poorly controlled immune responses.","['Chronic stress', 'Cortisol', 'Inflammation', 'Lymphocytes']","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2014-04-08,"[{'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rykova', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Feuerecker', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jäger', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Virology (Max von Pettenkofer-Institut), University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ladinig', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Basner', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Unit for Experimental Psychiatry, Division of Sleep and Chronobiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hörl', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Matzel', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaufmann', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Strewe', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nichiporuk', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Vassilieva', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Rinas', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Baatout', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Radiobiology, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, Mol, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Schelling', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Thiel', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinic of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Klinikum Mannheim, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dinges', 'firstname': 'D F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': 'Unit for Experimental Psychiatry, Division of Sleep and Chronobiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Morukov', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Choukèr', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Hospital of the University of Munich (LMU), Department of Anesthesiology, Research Group Stress & Immunity, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.

17875002",Plasma cytokine concentrations indicate that in vivo hormonal regulation of immunity is altered during long-duration spaceflight.,"Aspects of immune system dysregulation associated with long-duration spaceflight have yet to be fully characterized and may represent a clinical risk to crewmembers during deep space missions. Plasma cytokine concentration may serve as an indicator of in vivo physiological changes or immune system mobilization. The plasma concentrations of 22 cytokines were monitored in 28 astronauts during long-duration spaceflight onboard the International Space Station. Blood samples were collected 3 times before flight, 3-5 times during flight (depending on mission duration), at landing, and 30 days after landing. Analysis was performed by bead array immunoassay. With few exceptions, minimal detectable mean plasma concentrations were observed at baseline (launch minus 180) for innate inflammatory cytokines or adaptive regulatory cytokines; however, interleukin (IL)-1ra and several chemokines and growth factors were constitutively present. An increase in the plasma concentration, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), IL-8, IL-1ra, thrombopoietin (Tpo), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine ligand 4/macrophage inhibitory protein 1b (CCL4), and C-X-C motif chemokine 5/epithelial neutrophil-activating protein 78 (CXCL5) was observed associated with spaceflight. No significant alterations were observed during or following spaceflight for the inflammatory or adaptive/T-regulatory cytokines: IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IL-17, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, G-CSF, GM-CSF, FGF basic, CCL3, or CCL5.

16150498",During the long way to Mars: effects of 520 days of confinement (Mars500) on the assessment of affective stimuli and stage alteration in mood and plasma hormone levels.,"For future interplanetary manned spaceflight, mental issues, as well as physiological problems, must inevitably be considered and solved. Mars500 is a high-fidelity ground simulation experiment that involved 520 days of confined isolation for six multinational crewmembers. This experiment provided a good opportunity to perform psycho-physiological and psycho-social researches on such missions. To investigate emotional responses and psychological adaptation over long-term confinement, the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) was selected as the visual emotional stimuli in this study. Additional data collected and analyzed included the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire and the levels of four types of plasma hormones: cortisol, 5-hydroxy tryptamine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The results demonstrated an obvious bias on valence rating for unpleasant stimuli with time (p<0.05), and the correlation between psychological and biochemical data was identified (p<0.05). Overall, we concluded that the confined crew tended to assign positive ratings to negative pictures with time, which might be driven by a defensive system. There was a stage-changing pattern of psychological adaptation of the Mars500 crew, which is similar to the third-quarter phenomenon.",[],PloS one,2014-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'National Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application, China Astronaut Research and Training Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jing', 'firstname': 'Xiaolu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'China Astronaut Research and Training Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lv', 'firstname': 'Ke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application, China Astronaut Research and Training Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application, China Astronaut Research and Training Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bai', 'firstname': 'Yanqiang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application, China Astronaut Research and Training Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Yuejia', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Affective and Social Neuroscience, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Shanguang', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering, China Astronaut Research and Training Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yinghui', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application, China Astronaut Research and Training Center, Beijing, China.'}]",,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0087087,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc8935e0>
43,24373012,Analysis of gene expression during parabolic flights reveals distinct early gravity responses in Arabidopsis roots.,"Plant roots are among most intensively studied biological systems in gravity research. Altered gravity induces asymmetric cell growth leading to root bending. Differential distribution of the phytohormone auxin underlies root responses to gravity, being coordinated by auxin efflux transporters from the PIN family. The objective of this study was to compare early transcriptomic changes in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type, and pin2 and pin3 mutants under parabolic flight conditions and to correlate these changes to auxin distribution. Parabolic flights allow comparison of transient 1-g, hypergravity and microgravity effects in living organisms in parallel. We found common and mutation-related genes differentially expressed in response to transient microgravity phases. Gene ontology analysis of common genes revealed lipid metabolism, response to stress factors and light categories as primarily involved in response to transient microgravity phases, suggesting that fundamental reorganisation of metabolic pathways functions upstream of a further signal mediating hormonal network. Gene expression changes in roots lacking the columella-located PIN3 were stronger than in those deprived of the epidermis and cortex cell-specific PIN2. Moreover, repetitive exposure to microgravity/hypergravity and gravity/hypergravity flight phases induced an up-regulation of auxin responsive genes in wild type and pin2 roots, but not in pin3 roots, suggesting a critical function of PIN3 in mediating auxin fluxes in response to transient microgravity phases. Our study provides important insights towards understanding signal transduction processes in transient microgravity conditions by combining for the first time the parabolic flight platform with the transcriptome analysis of different genetic mutants in the model plant, Arabidopsis.","['Arabidopsis thaliana', 'microgravity', 'mutant', 'root', 'transcriptome']","Plant biology (Stuttgart, Germany)",2014-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Aubry-Hivet', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biology II/Botany, Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nziengui', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rapp', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Oliveira', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Paponov', 'firstname': 'I A', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hauslage', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vagt', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Braun', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ditengou', 'firstname': 'F A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dovzhenko', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Palme', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2013 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.,10.1111/plb.12130,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc7ea3b0>
44,24261064,Mental rotation task in a pilot during and after pregnancy.,"Discordant findings have been reported about the change in pregnant women's cognitive test performance. Visuo-spatial abilities, which are crucial in terrestrial/flight navigation, could be influenced by hormonal variations.
A 32-yr-old Italian Air Force pilot underwent a 2-D Mental Rotation Task (MRT) and hormonal assessment in the second trimester of pregnancy and 1 yr after delivery. Her performance was compared with that of two nonpregnant groups of women: one with flying experience and the other without. Estradiol and progesterone were significantly higher in pregnancy compared with postpartum, while testosterone was almost unchanged. During pregnancy, we observed a significant difference in the subject's response time compared with pilots (she was slower) and nonpilots (she was faster). One year after delivery, her performance was still better than the nonpilot group and was almost the same as the pilot group.
Our data are consistent with an effect of pregnancy on visuo-spatial ability that can last for some time after delivery, even with the early recovery of the hormonal levels. MRT smoothly changed in our subject, supporting previous findings that women who are experts in flight navigation are less sensitive to hormonal fluctuations.
In this case, visuospatial ability requiring effortful processing underwent variations during pregnancy and postpartum.

45,24217152,Spaceflight and ageing: reflecting on Caenorhabditis elegans in space.,"The prospect of space travel continues to capture the imagination. Several competing companies are now promising flights for the general population. Previously, it was recognized that many of the physiological changes that occur with spaceflight are similar to those seen with normal ageing. This led to the notion that spaceflight can be used as a model of accelerated ageing and raised concerns about the safety of individuals engaging in space travel. Paradoxically, however, space travel has been recently shown to be beneficial to some aspects of muscle health in the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is a commonly used laboratory animal for studying ageing. C. elegans displays age-related decline of some biological processes observed in ageing humans, and about 35% of C. elegans' genes have human homologs. Space flown worms were found to have decreased expression of a number of genes that increase lifespan when expressed at lower levels. These changes were accompanied by decreased accumulation of toxic protein aggregates in ageing worms' muscles. Thus, in addition to spaceflight producing physiological changes that are similar to accelerated ageing, it also appears to produce some changes similar to delayed ageing. Here, we put forward the hypothesis that in addition to the previously well-appreciated mechanotransduction changes, neural and endocrine signals are altered in response to spaceflight and that these may have both negative (e.g. less muscle protein) and some positive consequences (e.g. healthier muscles), at least for invertebrates, with respect to health in space. Given that changes in circulating hormones are well documented with age and in astronauts, our view is that further research into the relationship between metabolic control, ageing, and adaptation to the environment should be productive in advancing our understanding of the physiology of both spaceflight and ageing.",[],Gerontology,2013-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Honda', 'firstname': 'Yoko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Genomics for Longevity and Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Honda', 'firstname': 'Shuji', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Narici', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Szewczyk', 'firstname': 'Nathaniel J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1159/000354772,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc7fba90>
46,25509873,[Analysis of possible causes activation a stomach and pancreas excretory and incretory function after completion of space flight on the international space station].,"The research excretory and incretory of activity of a stomach and pancreas is carried out at astronauts in the early period after completion of space flights of various duration. It is shown, that the increase of the contents of gastric and pancreatic enzymes and hormones (insulin and C-peptide) in blood reflects increased excretory and incretory activity of organs of gastroduodenal area which arises in weightlessness. The complex of countermeasures, which prevent ingress of subjects, infected by Helicobacter pylori in space flight crew, excluded participation of this microorganism in the mechanism of increase of secretory activity of a stomach. The absence of interrelation between increase of secretory activity of gastroduodenal area organs and space flights' duration has allowed to exclude the hypokinetic mechanism which determined by duration of stay in weightlessness. It was shown that after the end of space flights the increase ofbasal excretory activity of organs of gastroduodenal area occurs simultaneously with increase of a fasting insulin secretion. The changes in gastroduodenal area organs revealed after space flights were are compared to similar changes received in ground-based experiments, simulating hemodynamic reorganization in venous system of abdominal cavity, arising in weightlessness. The conclusion is made, that the basic mechanism of changes of a functional condition of digestive system in space flights, is determined by reorganization venous hemodynamic in abdominal cavity organs reproduced in ground experiments. Increase insulin and C-peptide after space flights are considered as hormonal component of this hemodynamic mechanism.",[],Fiziologiia cheloveka,2013-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Afonin', 'firstname': 'B V', 'initials': 'BV', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc804a90>
47,23926664,Detection of renal and urinary tract proteins before and after spaceflight.,"The recent evolution of genomics and subsequently proteomics offers a major advance in the ability to understand individual human variation in disease and the molecular level changes induced by certain environmental exposures. This original study examines urinary proteome composition to enable the understanding of molecular homeostatic mechanisms in spaceflight and presents the potential for early detection of subclinical disease, microgravity risk mitigation strategies, and countermeasure development for exploration-class missions.
The urinary proteome composition of six Russian cosmonauts (men, ages 35-51) who flew long-duration missions of 169-199 d was determined 30 d before flight and compared to repeat studies 1 and 7 d postflight.
There were 430 proteins identified. Of those, 15 proteins originated in the renal tissues. Of the 15 urinary proteins, 10 were consistently present in the urine. However, the presence of five of the urinary proteins--neutral endopeptidase (NEP), afamin (AFAM), aquaporin-2 (AQP2), aminopeptidase A (AMPE), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)--was dependent on spaceflight exposure.
Proteomic investigation of pre- and postflight urine and bioinformation approaches to proteome analysis provide important data relative the mechanism of kidney function in spaceflight. In this initial study, we determined that the evaluation of urinary proteins may help investigators understand changes that are occurring in microgravity. Once additional ground-based and in-flight data are collected, it is feasible to develop targeted studies for tracking specific spaceflight related changes, determine countermeasure and risk-mitigation effectiveness, and possibly detect subclinical disease in flight crewmembers.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2013-08-10,"[{'lastname': 'Pastushkova', 'firstname': 'Lyudmila Kh', 'initials': 'LKh', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medicobiologic Problems, Russian Federation State Scientific Research Center Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kireev', 'firstname': 'Kirill S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kononikhin', 'firstname': 'Alexei S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ivanisenko', 'firstname': 'Vladimir A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Larina', 'firstname': 'Irina M', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nikolaev', 'firstname': 'Evgeny N', 'initials': 'EN', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"There were 430 proteins identified.

11013345",Organ-specific remodeling of the Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to spaceflight.,"Spaceflight presents a novel environment that is outside the evolutionary experience of terrestrial organisms. Full activation of the International Space Station as a science platform complete with sophisticated plant growth chambers, laboratory benches, and procedures for effective sample return, has enabled a new level of research capability and hypothesis testing in this unique environment. The opportunity to examine the strategies of environmental sensing in spaceflight, which includes the absence of unit gravity, provides a unique insight into the balance of influence among abiotic cues directing plant growth and development: including gravity, light, and touch. The data presented here correlate morphological and transcriptome data from replicated spaceflight experiments.
The transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated organ-specific changes in response to spaceflight, with 480 genes showing significant changes in expression in spaceflight plants compared with ground controls by at least 1.9-fold, and 58 by more than 7-fold. Leaves, hypocotyls, and roots each displayed unique patterns of response, yet many gene functions within the responses are related. Particularly represented across the dataset were genes associated with cell architecture and growth hormone signaling; processes that would not be anticipated to be altered in microgravity yet may correlate with morphological changes observed in spaceflight plants. As examples, differential expression of genes involved with touch, cell wall remodeling, root hairs, and cell expansion may correlate with spaceflight-associated root skewing, while differential expression of auxin-related and other gravity-signaling genes seemingly correlates with the microgravity of spaceflight. Although functionally related genes were differentially represented in leaves, hypocotyls, and roots, the expression of individual genes varied substantially across organ types, indicating that there is no single response to spaceflight. Rather, each organ employed its own response tactics within a shared strategy, largely involving cell wall architecture.
Spaceflight appears to initiate cellular remodeling throughout the plant, yet specific strategies of the response are distinct among specific organs of the plant. Further, these data illustrate that in the absence of gravity plants rely on other environmental cues to initiate the morphological responses essential to successful growth and development, and that the basis for that engagement lies in the differential expression of genes in an organ-specific manner that maximizes the utilization of these signals--such as the up-regulation of genes associated with light-sensing in roots.",[],BMC plant biology,2013-08-08,"[{'lastname': 'Paul', 'firstname': 'Anna-Lisa', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Horticultural Sciences, Program in Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zupanska', 'firstname': 'Agata K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schultz', 'firstname': 'Eric R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferl', 'firstname': 'Robert J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated organ-specific changes in response to spaceflight, with 480 genes showing significant changes in expression in spaceflight plants compared with ground controls by at least 1.9-fold, and 58 by more than 7-fold.

As examples, differential expression of genes involved with touch, cell wall remodeling, root hairs, and cell expansion may correlate with spaceflight-associated root skewing, while differential expression of auxin-related and other gravity-signaling genes seemingly correlates with the microgravity of spaceflight. Although functionally related genes were differentially represented in leaves, hypocotyls, and roots, the expression of individual genes varied substantially across organ types, indicating that there is no single response to spaceflight. Rather, each organ employed its own response tactics within a shared strategy, largely involving cell wall architecture.",,"10.1186/1471-2229-13-112

49,23598869,[Four-week simulated weightlessness increases the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide in the myocardium].,"One of the major circulatory changes that occur in human during space flight and simulated weightlessness is a cerebral redistribution of body fluids, which is accompanied by an increase of blood volume in the upper body. Therefore, atrial myocardium should increase the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), but the researches lack common conclusion until now. The present study was to investigate the expression level of ANP in simulated weightlessness rats, and to confirm the changes of ANP by observing the associated proteins of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). The tail-suspended rat model was used to simulate weightlessness. Western blots were carried out to examine the expression levels of ANP and SNARE proteins in atrial and left ventricular myocardium. The results showed that ANP expression in atrial myocardium showed an increase in 4-week tail-suspended rats (SUS) compared with that in the synchronous control rats (CON). We only detected a trace amount of ANP in the left ventricular myocardium of the CON, but found an enhanced expression of ANP in left ventricular myocardium of the SUS. Expression of VAMP-1/2 (vesicle associated SNARE) increased significantly in both atrial and left ventricular myocardium in the SUS compared with that in the CON. There was no difference of the expression of syntaxin-4 (target compartment associated SNARE) between the CON and SUS, but the expression of SNAP-23 showed an increase in atrial myocardium of the SUS compared with that in the CON. Synip and Munc-18c as regulators of SNAREs did not show significant difference between the CON and SUS. These results suggest that the expression of ANP shows an increase in atrial and left ventricular myocardium of 4-week tail-suspended rats. Enhanced expression of VAMP-1/2 associated with ANP vesicles confirms the increased expression of ANP in atrial and left ventricular myocardium.",[],Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],2013-04-20,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Wen-Cheng', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': ""Key Laboratory of Aerospace Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Aerospace Physiology, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yuan-Ming', 'initials': 'YM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Huai-Zhang', 'initials': 'HZ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Peng-Tao', 'initials': 'PT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Zhi-Bin', 'initials': 'ZB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc77def0>
50,23312287,Long-term space flight simulation reveals infradian rhythmicity in human Na(+) balance.,"The steady-state concept of Na(+) homeostasis, based on short-term investigations of responses to high salt intake, maintains that dietary Na(+) is rapidly eliminated into urine, thereby achieving constant total-body Na(+) and water content. We introduced the reverse experimental approach by fixing salt intake of men participating in space flight simulations at 12 g, 9 g, and 6 g/day for months and tested for the predicted constancy in urinary excretion and total-body Na(+) content. At constant salt intake, daily Na(+) excretion exhibited aldosterone-dependent, weekly (circaseptan) rhythms, resulting in periodic Na(+) storage. Changes in total-body Na(+) (±200-400 mmol) exhibited longer infradian rhythm periods (about monthly and longer period lengths) without parallel changes in body weight and extracellular water and were directly related to urinary aldosterone excretion and inversely to urinary cortisol, suggesting rhythmic hormonal control.

Changes in blood flow, systemic hormones, and locally produced factors were indicated as important elements contributing to the response of osteoblastic cells to loading, but research in this field still has many questions. Here, the possible biological involvement of thyroid C cells is being investigated. The paper is a comparison between a case of a wild type single mouse and a over-expressing pleiotrophin single mouse exposed to hypogravity conditions during the first animal experiment of long stay in International Space Station (91 days) and three similar mice exposed to hypergravity (2Gs) conditions. We provide evidence that both microgravity and hypergravity induce similar loss of C cells with reduction of calcitonin production. Pleiotrophin over-expression result in some protection against negative effects of gravity change. Potential implication of the gravity mechanic forces in the regulation of bone homeostasis via thyroid equilibrium is discussed.",[],PloS one,2013-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Albi', 'firstname': 'Elisabetta', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Nuclear Lipid BioPathology, Centro Ricerche Analisi Biochimico Specialistiche, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Curcio', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Spelat', 'firstname': 'Renza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazzarini', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazzarini', 'firstname': 'Remo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cataldi', 'firstname': 'Samuela', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Loreti', 'firstname': 'Elisabetta', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferri', 'firstname': 'Ivana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ambesi-Impiombato', 'firstname': 'Francesco Saverio', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0048518,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc794590>

19061483",Nature of Pre-Earthquake Phenomena and their Effects on Living Organisms.,"Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.","['ELF (extremely low frequency) waves', 'ULF (ultralow frequency) waves', 'air ionization', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'physiological effects', 'positive holes', 'pre-earthquake phenomena', 'water oxidation']",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2013-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Freund', 'firstname': 'Friedemann', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'GeoCosmo Science Group, SETI Institute, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

19874203",Bone metabolism and nutritional status during 30-day head-down-tilt bed rest.,"Bed rest studies provide an important tool for modeling physiological changes that occur during spaceflight. Markers of bone metabolism and nutritional status were evaluated in 12 subjects (8 men, 4 women; ages 25-49 yr) who participated in a 30-day -6° head-down-tilt diet-controlled bed rest study. Blood and urine samples were collected twice before, once a week during, and twice after bed rest. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effects linear regression with a priori contrasts comparing all days to the second week of the pre-bed rest acclimation period. During bed rest, all urinary markers of bone resorption increased ~20% (P < 0.001), and serum parathyroid hormone decreased ~25% (P < 0.001). Unlike longer (>60 days) bed rest studies, neither markers of oxidative damage nor iron status indexes changed over the 30 days of bed rest. Urinary oxalate excretion decreased ~20% during bed rest (P < 0.001) and correlated inversely with urinary calcium (R = -0.18, P < 0.02). These data provide a broad overview of the biochemistry associated with short-duration bed rest studies and provide an impetus for using shorter studies to save time and costs wherever possible. For some effects related to bone biochemistry, short-duration bed rest will fulfill the scientific requirements to simulate spaceflight, but other effects (antioxidants/oxidative damage, iron status) do not manifest until subjects are in bed longer, in which case longer studies or other analogs may be needed. Regardless, maximizing research funding and opportunities will be critical to enable the next steps in space exploration.",[],"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2012-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Morgan', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Oak Ridge Associated Universities, NASA Johnson Space Center, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zwart', 'firstname': 'Sara R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Heer', 'firstname': 'Martina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ploutz-Snyder', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ericson', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Scott M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/japplphysiol.01064.2012,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc748400>

11328886",The impact of long-term exposure to space environment on adult mammalian organisms: a study on mouse thyroid and testis.,"Hormonal changes in humans during spaceflight have been demonstrated but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. To clarify this point thyroid and testis/epididymis, both regulated by anterior pituitary gland, have been analyzed on long-term space-exposed male C57BL/10 mice, either wild type or pleiotrophin transgenic, overexpressing osteoblast stimulating factor-1. Glands were submitted to morphological and functional analysis.In thyroids, volumetric ratios between thyrocytes and colloid were measured. cAMP production in 10(-7)M and 10(-8)M thyrotropin-treated samples was studied. Thyrotropin receptor and caveolin-1 were quantitized by immunoblotting and localized by immunofluorescence. In space-exposed animals, both basal and thyrotropin-stimulated cAMP production were always higher. Also, the structure of thyroid follicles appeared more organized, while thyrotropin receptor and caveolin-1 were overexpressed. Unlike the control samples, in the space samples thyrotropin receptor and caveolin-1 were both observed at the intracellular junctions, suggesting their interaction in specific cell membrane microdomains.In testes, immunofluorescent reaction for 3β- steroid dehydrogenase was performed and the relative expressions of hormone receptors and interleukin-1β were quantified by RT-PCR. Epididymal sperm number was counted. In space-exposed animals, the presence of 3β and 17β steroid dehydrogenase was reduced. Also, the expression of androgen and follicle stimulating hormone receptors increased while lutenizing hormone receptor levels were not affected. The interleukin 1 β expression was upregulated. The tubular architecture was altered and the sperm cell number was significantly reduced in spaceflight mouse epididymis (approx. -90% vs. laboratory and ground controls), indicating that the space environment may lead to degenerative changes in seminiferous tubules.Space-induced changes of structure and function of thyroid and testis/epididymis could be responsible for variations of hormone levels in human during space missions.

55,22462370,Transient immune impairment after a simulated long-haul flight.,"Almost 2 billion people travel aboard commercial airlines every year, with about 20% developing symptoms of the common cold within 1 wk after air travel. We hypothesize that hypobaric hypoxic conditions associated with air travel may contribute to immune impairment.
We studied the effects of hypobaric hypoxic conditions during a simulated flight at 8000 ft (2438 m) cruising altitude on immune and stress markers in 52 healthy volunteers (mean age 31) before and on days 1, 4, and 7 after the flight. We did a cohort study using a generalized estimating equation to examine the differences in the repeated measures.
Our findings show that the hypobaric hypoxic conditions of a 10-h overnight simulation flight are not associated with severe immune impairment or abnormal IgA or cortisol levels, but with transient impairment in some parameters: we observed a transient decrease in lymphocyte proliferative responses combined with an upregulation in CD69 and CD14 cells and a decrease in HLA-DR in the immediate days following the simulated flight that normalized by day 7 in most instances.
These transient immune changes may contribute to an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections commonly seen after long-haul flights.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2012-04-03,"[{'lastname': 'Wilder-Smith', 'firstname': 'Annelies', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, National University Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore. epvws@pacific.net.sg'}, {'lastname': 'Mustafa', 'firstname': 'Fatima B', 'initials': 'FB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Chung Mien', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Earnest', 'firstname': 'Arul', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koh', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Gen', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hossain', 'firstname': 'Iqbal', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'MacAry', 'firstname': 'Paul A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Our findings show that the hypobaric hypoxic conditions of a 10-h overnight simulation flight are not associated with severe immune impairment or abnormal IgA or cortisol levels, but with transient impairment in some parameters: we observed a transient decrease in lymphocyte proliferative responses combined with an upregulation in CD69 and CD14 cells and a decrease in HLA-DR in the immediate days following the simulated flight that normalized by day 7 in most instances.",,10.3357/asem.3162.2012,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc6c6360>

The main objective was to assess testosterone and hormone status in long- and short-duration space flight and bed rest environments and to determine relationships with other physiological systems, including bone and muscle.
Blood and urine samples were collected before, during, and after long-duration space flight. Samples were also collected before and after 12- to 14-d missions and from participants in 30- to 90-d bed rest studies.
Space flight studies were conducted on the International Space Station and before and after Space Shuttle missions. Bed rest studies were conducted in a clinical research center setting. Data from Skylab missions are also presented.
All of the participants were male, and they included 15 long-duration and nine short-duration mission crew members and 30 bed rest subjects.
Serum total, free, and bioavailable testosterone were measured along with serum and urinary cortisol, serum dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and SHBG.
Total, free, and bioavailable testosterone was not changed during long-duration space flight but were decreased (P < 0.01) on landing day after these flights and after short-duration space flight.

58,21702314,Adrenocortical and immune responses following short- and long-duration spaceflight.,"Short-term spaceflight is associated with significant but reversible immunological alterations. However, little information exists on the effects of long-duration spaceflight on neuroimmune responses.
We collected multiple pre- and postflight samples from Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers in order to compare adrenocortical and immune responses between short- (approximately 11 d) and long-duration (approximately 180 d) spaceflight.
In Shuttle crewmembers, increased stress hormone levels and altered leukocyte subsets were observed prior to launch and at landing. Additionally, typical stress-induced shifts in leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets, as well as the percentage of T-cells capable of producing intracellular IFN-gamma were also decreased just before launch and immediately after landing. Plasma IL-10 levels were increased before launch but not postflight. No preflight changes occurred in ISS crewmembers, but long-duration crewmembers exhibited significantly greater spikes in both plasma and urinary cortisol at landing as compared to Shuttle crewmembers. The percentage of T-cells capable of producing intracellular IFN-gamma was decreased in ISS crewmembers. Plasma IL-10 was increased postflight. Unexpectedly, stress-induced shifts in lymphocyte subpopulations were absent after long-duration flights despite significantly increased stress hormones at landing.

60,21087161,Thyroid cell growth: sphingomyelin metabolism as non-invasive marker for cell damage acquired during spaceflight.,"Prolonged spaceflights are known to elicit changes in human cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems, whose functions are regulated by the thyroid gland. It is known that sphingomyelin metabolism is involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death) of thyroid cells induced by UVC radiation, but at present no data exists with regard to this phenomenon, which occurs during space missions. The aim of this study was to analyze, for the first time, the effect of spaceflight on the enzymes of sphingomyelin metabolism, sphingomyelinase, and sphingomyelin synthase, and to determine whether the ratio between the two enzymes might be used as a possible marker for thyroid activity during space missions. Both quiescent thyroid cells and thyroid cells stimulated to proliferate with thyrotropin (TSH) were cultured during the Eneide and Esperia missions on the International Space Station. The results show that during space missions the cells treated with TSH grew only 1.5 ± 0.65-fold and, thus, behave similarly to quiescent cells, while on the ground the same cells, maintained in experimental conditions that reproduced those of the flight, grew 7.71 ± 0.67-fold. Comparison of the sphingomyelinase/sphingomyelin-synthase ratio and the levels of Bax, STAT3, and RNA polymerase II in proliferating, quiescent, pro-apoptotic, or apoptotic cells demonstrated that thyroid cells during space missions were induced into a pro-apoptotic state. Given its specificity and the small amount of cells needed for analysis, we propose the use of the sphingomyelinase/sphingomyelin-synthase ratio as a marker of functional status of thyroid cells during space missions. Further studies could lead to its use in real time during prolonged spaceflights.",[],Astrobiology,2010-11-20,"[{'lastname': 'Albi', 'firstname': 'Elisabetta', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Physiopathology Section, University School of Medicine, Perugia, Italy. ealbi@unipg.it'}, {'lastname': 'Ambesi-Impiombato', 'firstname': 'Saverio', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Villani', 'firstname': 'Maristella', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'De Pol', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Spelat', 'firstname': 'Renza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazzarini', 'firstname': 'Remo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Perrella', 'firstname': 'Giuseppina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1089/ast.2010.0461,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc644810>

11003993",Vision impairs the abilities of bats to avoid colliding with stationary obstacles.,"Free-flying insectivorous bats occasionally collide with stationary objects they should easily detect by echolocation and avoid. Collisions often occur with lighted objects, suggesting ambient light may deleteriously affect obstacle avoidance capabilities. We tested the hypothesis that free-flying bats may orient by vision when they collide with some obstacles. We additionally tested whether acoustic distractions, such as ""distress calls"" of other bats, contributed to probabilities of collision.
To investigate the role of visual cues in the collisions of free-flying little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with stationary objects, we set up obstacles in an area of high bat traffic during swarming. We used combinations of light intensities and visually dissimilar obstacles to verify that bats orient by vision. In early August, bats collided more often in the light than the dark, and probabilities of collision varied with the visibility of obstacles. However, the probabilities of collisions altered in mid to late August, coincident with the start of behavioural, hormonal, and physiological changes occurring during swarming and mating. Distress calls did not distract bats and increase the incidence of collisions.
Our findings indicate that visual cues are more important for free-flying bats than previously recognized, suggesting integration of multi-sensory modalities during orientation. Furthermore, our study highlights differences between responses of captive and wild bats, indicating a need for more field experiments.",[],PloS one,2010-11-19,"[{'lastname': 'Orbach', 'firstname': 'Dara N', 'initials': 'DN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada. dnorbach@gmail.com'}, {'lastname': 'Fenton', 'firstname': 'Brock', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0013912,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc64cae0>
62,19601502,Growth hormone levels after flywheel ergometer exercise: correlation with independent variables.,"In-flight muscle mass and strength losses are likely exacerbated by low growth hormone (GH) concentrations. Factors associated with exercise may foretell resultant GH levels and thereby help blunt future mass and strength losses.
To assess the ability of variables to predict GH variance from resistive exercise done on a flywheel ergometer (FE) designed for in-flight exercise, subjects (N=17) performed three types of workouts on the device. With a randomized design, subjects performed the workouts with the intent to determine if changes in post-exercise GH concentrations are impacted by contractile mode and workload. Body mass, blood lactate (BLa-) concentrations, and peak angular velocity (PAV), average power (AP), and total work (TW) from workouts attempted to predict GH variance. Pre-exercise blood draws, and at 1 and 30 min after workouts, were used to determine GH concentrations. BLa- levels were measured before workouts and at 5 min post-exercise. Delta (8, post-pre) and 30-min post-workout GH levels served as criterion variables.
Multivariate regression with an alpha < or = 0.05 yielded the following significant prediction equation: deltaGH = 13.64 - 0.014 (body mass) - 0.607 (post-exercise BLa-) + 0.659 (deltaBLa-) - 0.624(PAV) + 0.653(TW) + 0.147(AP).

Workload of 40 pilots was measured using physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, blink frequency, saliva cortisol concentration) and psychological (fatigue, sleepiness, tension, and task load) parameters. Approaches were conducted in A320 and A330 full-flight simulators during night shift. SCDA was compared to the standard Low Drag Low Power (LDLP) procedure as reference.
Mean heart rate and blood pressure during the SCDA were not elevated, but were partly, even significantly, reduced (on average by 5 bpm and 4 mmHg from the flying captain). Cortisol levels did not change significantly with mean values of 0.9 to 1.2 ng ml(-1). Landing was the most demanding segment of both approaches as indicated by significant increases in heart rate and decreases in blink frequency. Subjective task load was low.

66,19013293,Triiodothyronine increases calcium loss in a bed rest antigravity model for space flight.,"Bed rest has been used as a model to simulate the effects of space flight on bone metabolism. Thyroid hormones accelerate bone metabolism. Thus, supraphysiologic doses of this hormone might be used as a model to accelerate bone metabolism during bed rest and potentially simulate space flight. The objective of the study was to quantitate the changes in bone turnover after low doses of triiodothyronine (T(3)) added to short-term bed rest. Nine men and 5 women were restricted to bed rest for 28 days with their heads positioned 6 degrees below their feet. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or oral T(3) at doses of 50 to 75 microg/d in a single-blind fashion. Calcium balance was measured over 5-day periods; and T(3), thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured weekly.

Calcium balance was negative by 300 to 400 mg/d in the T(3)-treated volunteers, primarily because of the increased fecal loss that was not present in the placebo group. Urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, a marker of bone resorption, increased 60% in the placebo group during bed rest, but more than doubled in the T(3)-treated subjects (P < .01), suggesting that bone resorption was enhanced by treatment with T(3).

67,19006009,"The effect of parabolic flight on perceived physical, motivational and psychological state in men and women: correlation with neuroendocrine stress parameters and electrocortical activity.","Previous findings of decreased mental and perceptual motor performance during parabolic flights have been attributed mainly to the primary effects of weightlessness rather than the accompanying effects of stress and altered mood. Although recent studies have alluded to the possible negative effects of stress on performance, there has been no attempt to investigate this during parabolic flights. Over a period of 3 years, 27 human participants (male n = 18, mean age +/- SD 34.67 +/- 7.59 years; female n = 9, 36.22 +/- 9.92 years) were recruited with the aim to evaluate if, and to what extent, parabolic flights are accompanied by changes in mood. Furthermore, the relationships between mood and physiological markers of stress and arousal, namely circulating stress hormones (ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, prolactin and brain activity (EEG)) were investigated. A strong and significant correlation was found between circulating stress hormone concentrations and perceived physical state, motivational state (MOT) and psychological strain (PSYCHO), whereas no interaction between mood and EEG or EEG and stress hormone concentrations was observed. Therefore, two different stress responses appear to be present during parabolic flight. The first seems to be characterised by general cortical arousal, whereas the second seems to evolve from the adrenomedullary system. It is likely that both these mechanisms have different effects on mental and perceptual motor performance, which require further investigation and should to be taken into account when interpreting previous weightlessness research.",[],"Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2008-11-14,"[{'lastname': 'Schneider', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Exercise Neuroscience, Institute of Motor Control and Movement Technique, German Sport University Cologne, Carl-Diem Weg 6, Köln, Germany. schneider@dshs-koeln.de'}, {'lastname': 'Askew', 'firstname': 'Christopher D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brümmer', 'firstname': 'Vera', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kleinert', 'firstname': 'Jens', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guardiera', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Abel', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Strüder', 'firstname': 'Heiko K', 'initials': 'HK', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1080/10253890802499175,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc551d10>

Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",[],Journal of pineal research,2008-07-18,"[{'lastname': 'Manda', 'firstname': 'Kailash', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan. kailashmanda@gmail.com'}, {'lastname': 'Ueno', 'firstname': 'Megumi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Anzai', 'firstname': 'Kazunori', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1600-079X.2008.00611.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc55c180>

12517450",Proteomic analysis of mouse hypothalamus under simulated microgravity.,"Exposure to altered microgravity during space travel induces changes in the brain and these are reflected in many of the physical behavior seen in the astronauts. The vulnerability of the brain to microgravity stress has been reviewed and reported. Identifying microgravity-induced changes in the brain proteome may aid in understanding the impact of the microgravity environment on brain function. In our previous study we have reported changes in specific proteins under simulated microgravity in the hippocampus using proteomics approach. In the present study the profiling of the hypothalamus region in the brain was studied as a step towards exploring the effect of microgravity in this region of the brain. Hypothalamus is the critical region in the brain that strictly controls the pituitary gland that in turn is responsible for the secretion of important hormones. Here we report a 2-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of the mouse hypothalamus in response to simulated microgravity. Lowered glutathione and differences in abundance expression of seven proteins were detected in the hypothalamus of mice exposed to microgravity. These changes included decreased superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2) and increased malate dehydrogenase and peroxiredoxin-6, reflecting reduction of the antioxidant system in the hypothalamus. Taken together the results reported here indicate that oxidative imbalance occurred in the hypothalamus in response to simulated microgravity.",[],Neurochemical research,2008-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Sarkar', 'firstname': 'Poonam', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, 35294, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sarkar', 'firstname': 'Shubhashish', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Vani', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Helen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kulkarni', 'firstname': 'Anil', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hall', 'firstname': 'Joseph C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Bobby L', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Renard L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pellis', 'firstname': 'Neal R', 'initials': 'NR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Govindarajan T', 'initials': 'GT', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s11064-008-9738-1,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc4e9680>

Using 21 day 6 head-down tilt bed rest as a spaceflight analog, this study describes the effects of a daily artificial gravity (AG) countermeasure treatment on immunity, stress, and reactivation of clinically important latent herpes viruses. Blood, saliva, and urine samples were collected from each of the 15 male test subjects (8 treatment, 7 control) periodically throughout the study. The immune assessment consisted of a comprehensive peripheral immunophenotype analysis, intracellular cytokine profiles, and measurement of T cell function.

The objective of this study was to develop a model of spaceflight by using a human centrifuge to reproduce launch and landing G forces along with bed rest to simulate microgravity.
Acute changes in G forces are causal factors in neuroendocrine and immune changes.
Ten subjects underwent realistic launch G-force profiles followed by 16 d of 60 head-down tilt bed rest. At the end of the bed rest, subjects were subjected to realistic landing G-force profiles. Stress hormones and changes in leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets were measured in blood and urine samples over the course of the study.
Similar to shorter Shuttle missions (i.e., < or = 9 d), plasma cortisol was significantly decreased at simulated landing while urinary epinephrine was significantly increased. Urinary cortisol was significantly increased after simulated launch. The pattern of leukocyte and lymphocyte changes also mirrored the changes found in shorter 9-d spaceflights.
These data suggest a role for both catecholamines and glucocorticoids in mediating changes in leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets during simulated microgravity coupled with hypergravity.

73,17706676,"Sleep under extreme environments: effects of heat and cold exposure, altitude, hyperbaric pressure and microgravity in space.","Human sleep is sensitive to the individual's environment. The present review examines current knowledge of human sleep patterns under different environments: heat exposure, cold exposure, altitude, high pressure and microgravity in space. Heat exposure has two effects. In people living in temperate conditions, moderate heat loads (hot bath, sauna) prior to sleep provoke a delayed reaction across time (diachronic reaction) whereby slow-wave sleep (SWS) augments in the following night (neurogenic adaptive pathway). Melanoids and Caucasians living in the Sahel dry tropical climate experience diachronic increases in SWS throughout seasonal acclimatization. Such increases are greater during the hot season, being further enhanced after daytime exercise. On the contrary, when subjects are acutely exposed to heat, diachronic decreases in total sleep time and SWS occur, being often accompanied by synchronic (concomitant) diminution in REM sleep. Stress hormones increase. Nocturnal cold exposure provokes a synchronic decrease in REM sleep along with an activation of stress hormones (synchronic somatic reaction). SWS remains undisturbed as it still occurs at the beginning of the night before nocturnal body cooling. Altitude and high pressure are deleterious to sleep, especially in non-acclimatized individuals. In their controlled environment, astronauts can sleep well in microgravity. Exercise-induced sleep changes help to understand environmental effects on sleep: well-tolerated environmental strains may improve sleep through a neurogenic adaptive pathway; when this ""central"" adaptive pathway is overloaded or bypassed, diachronic and synchronic sleep disruptions occur.",[],Journal of the neurological sciences,2007-08-21,"[{'lastname': 'Buguet', 'firstname': 'Alain', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Radicaux libres, substrats énergétiques et physiopathologie cérébrale (EA4170), Université Claude-Bernard Lyon 1, 8 Avenue Rockefeller, 69373, Lyon Cedex 08, France. alain.buguet@sante.univ-lyon1.fr'}]",,,,,10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.040,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc51f950>
74,17639784,Sleep research in space: expression of immediate early genes in forebrain structures of rats during the nasa neurolab mission (STS-90).,"1. Electrophysiological and behavioural observations have shown that changes in the sleep-waking activity occur in astronauts during the space flight. Experiments performed in ground-based experiments have previously shown that the immediate early gene (IEG) c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation, can be used as a molecular correlate of sleep and waking. However, while Fos expression peaks within 2-4 hours after the stimulus and returns to baseline within 6-8 hours, other IEGs as the FRA proteins which are also synthetized soon after their induction, persist in the cell nuclei for longer periods of time, ranging from 1-2 days to weeks. 2. Both Fos and FRA expression were evaluated in several adult albino rats sacrificed at different time points of the space flight, i.e. either at FD2 and FD14, i.e. at launch and about two weeks after launch, respectively, or at R + 1 and R + 13, i.e. at the reentry and about two weeks after landing. The changes in Fos and FRA expression were then compared with those obtained in ground controls. These experiments demonstrate activation of several brain areas which varies during the different phases of the space flight. Due to their different time of persistence, Fos and FRA immunohistochemistry can provide only correlative observations. In particular, FRA expression has been quite helpful to identify the occurrence of short-lasting events such as those related either to stress or to REM-sleep, whose episodes last in the rat only a few min and could hardly be detected by using only Fos expression. 3. Evidence was presented indicating that at FD2 and FD14 Fos-labeled cells were observed in several brain areas in which Fos had been previously identified as being induced by spontaneous or forced waking in ground-based experiments. In contrast to these findings FLT rats sacrificed at R + 1 showed low levels of Fos immunostaining in the cerebral cortex (neocortex) and several forebrain structures such as the hypothalamus and thalamus. Some Fos staining was also present in limbic cortical areas, the septum, and the hippocampus. The main area of the forebrain of FLT rats sacrificed at R + 1, showing an increased expression of Fos, was the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) (cf. 127), as well as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) nucleus (cf. 122). At R + 13 Fos immunostaining was variable among FLT rats. However, none of these rats showed a significant number of Fos-positive cells in CeA. 4. Most of the rats studied for Fos expression were also tested for FRA expression. In particular, a scattered amount of FRA expression occurred at FD14 in different areas of the neocortex and in limbic forebrain regions (such as the cingulate, retrosplenial and entorhinal cortex). It included also the hippocampus, the lateral septum, the caudate/putamen, as well as some hypothalamic regions. At the reentry (R + 1) it was previously shown that a prominent increase in FRA expression occurred in the LC of FLT rats (cf. 122). This finding was associated with an increase in FRA expression which affected not only the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis of the medulla, which sends excitatory glutamatergic afferents to the LC (cf. 31 for ref.), but also structures which are known to produce corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide which activates the noradrenergic LC neurons during stress. 5. These findings which result from acceleration stress were followed by REMS episodes, which probably occurred after a long period of sleep deprivation following exposure to microgravity. It was previously shown that an increase in Fos and FRA expression occurred at the reentry in some pontine and medullary reticular structures (cf. 128), which are likely to be involved in both the descending (postural atonia) and the ascending manifestations of PS. These findings can be integrated by results of the present experiments showing that at the reentry high levels of FRA expression occurred in the hippocampus and the limbic system, i.e. in structures which are involved in the generalized pattern of EEG desynchronization and the theta activity, typical of REMS (cf. 83, 84). A prominent increase in FRA expression also affected at the reentry some components of the amygdaloid complex, particularly the CeA. as well as some related structures, such as the lateral parabrachial nucleus (cf. 122) and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (cf. 127). These structures are known to contribute to the PGO waves, which drive the oculomotor system either directly or through the medial vestibular nuclei (128, cf. also 126). Unfortunately due to our brainstem transections we were unable to evaluate the changes in gene expression which could affect the dorsolateral pontine structures during the occurrence of REMS episodes. Further experiments are thus required to investigate the role that these pontine structures exert in determining adaptive changes following exposure to microgravity after launch as well as readaptation to the terrestrial environment after landing.",[],Archives italiennes de biologie,2007-07-21,"[{'lastname': 'Centini', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Fisiologia Umana, Università di Pisa, Via San Zeno 31, 1-56127, Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pompeiano', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc464f40>

16081365","Immune system changes during simulated planetary exploration on Devon Island, high arctic.","Dysregulation of the immune system has been shown to occur during spaceflight, although the detailed nature of the phenomenon and the clinical risks for exploration class missions have yet to be established. Also, the growing clinical significance of immune system evaluation combined with epidemic infectious disease rates in third world countries provides a strong rationale for the development of field-compatible clinical immunology techniques and equipment. In July 2002 NASA performed a comprehensive immune assessment on field team members participating in the Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) on Devon Island in the high Canadian Arctic. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of mission-associated stressors on the human immune system. To perform the study, the development of techniques for processing immune samples in remote field locations was required. Ten HMP-2002 participants volunteered for the study. A field protocol was developed at NASA-JSC for performing sample collection, blood staining/processing for immunophenotype analysis, whole-blood mitogenic culture for functional assessments and cell-sample preservation on-location at Devon Island. Specific assays included peripheral leukocyte distribution; constitutively activated T cells, intracellular cytokine profiles, plasma cortisol and EBV viral antibody levels. Study timepoints were 30 days prior to mission start, mid-mission and 60 days after mission completion.
The protocol developed for immune sample processing in remote field locations functioned properly. Samples were processed on Devon Island, and stabilized for subsequent analysis at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The data indicated that some phenotype, immune function and stress hormone changes occurred in the HMP field participants that were largely distinct from pre-mission baseline and post-mission recovery data. These immune changes appear similar to those observed in astronauts following spaceflight.
The immune system changes described during the HMP field deployment validate the use of the HMP as a ground-based spaceflight/planetary exploration analog for some aspects of human physiology. The sample processing protocol developed for this study may have applications for immune studies in remote terrestrial field locations.

10836635",Parabolic flight experience is related to increased release of stress hormones.,"Numerous studies have shown significant effects of weightlessness on adaptational processes of the CNS, cardiovascular and/or muscular system. Most of these studies have been carried out during parabolic flights, using the recurring 20 s of weightlessness at each parabola. Although some of these studies reported on potential influences not only of weightlessness but also of the stressful situation within a parabolic flight, especially provoked by the ongoing changes between 1.8, 1 and 0 G, so far there seems to be only marginal information about objective parameters of stress evoked by parabolic flights. By collecting blood samples from a permanent venous catheter several times during parabolic flights, we were able to show an increase of prolactin, cortisol and ACTH in the course of a 120 min flight. We conclude, therefore, that previous reported effects of weightlessness on adaptational processes may be affected not only by weightlessness but also by the exposure to other stressors experienced within the environment of a Zero-G airbus.",[],European journal of applied physiology,2007-03-14,"[{'lastname': 'Schneider', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Motor Control and Movement Technique, Department of Exercise Neuroscience, German Sport University Cologne, Köln, Germany. schneider@dshs-koeln.de'}, {'lastname': 'Brümmer', 'firstname': 'Vera', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Göbel', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carnahan', 'firstname': 'Heather', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dubrowski', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Strüder', 'firstname': 'Heiko K', 'initials': 'HK', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s00421-007-0433-8,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc497130>
77,17225479,"Atopic dermatitis: diagnosis, treatment, and aeromedical implications.","Over the past 30 yr, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) has increased significantly in the general population. Given this increased burden of disease, more AD will be seen in civilian and military aviators. This article reviews the clinical aspects of AD with a focus on the aeromedical implications of the disease. The diagnosis of AD is mainly clinical. Treatment options are numerous, although topical corticosteroids are generally the mainstay of treatment. The new immunomodulators are options for treatment of AD and have advantages and disadvantages when compared with topical corticosteroids. These immunomodulators are discussed in detail with an emphasis on their mechanism of action, efficacy, side effect profile, and possible risks. The implications of AD in aviators and safety of flight are reviewed. Interference of the wearing of cockpit equipment, use of systemic or topical medications, and AD's association with the other diseases of atopy all contribute to whether an aviator is qualified to fly. Environmental triggers, such as temperature changes, sweating, humidity, bathing frequency, contact with irritating substances, and stress may exacerbate the aviator's disease. Special consideration should be given to the severity of their disease, the treatment the aviator requires, and the environment he or she will be working and living in before giving aeromedical clearance. Finally, the policies of each military service and experiences in civil aviation are discussed.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2007-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Gates', 'firstname': 'Trina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute, Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL, USA. trina.gates@yahoo.com'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc429900>
78,16760631,The pituitary-testicular axis in microgravity: analogies with the aging male syndrome.,"Extraterrestrial exploration has gone on for decades before reversible testicular failure was shown to be a consequence of space flight in humans and animals at the end of the XXth century. This phenomenon was initially thought to depend on the psycho-physical stress expected to derive from a decidedly unusual environment, but the lack of consistent data concerning cortisol increase and/or gonadotrophin suppression pointed to the possibility of a primary defect. This was indirectly confirmed by the observation that a continuum of testicular androgen secretion potential exists from microgravity to centrifuge-derived hypergravity. Further experiments using tissue slices and suspended cells confirmed a direct inhibitory effect of microgravity upon testicular androgen production. A parallel deterioration of major physiological parameters, such as bone density, muscle mass/force, red blood cell mass, hydration and cardiopulmonary performance, has been repeatedly described during space missions, which, luckily enough, fully recover within days to weeks after landing, the time lag depending on single organ/system adaptation rates. According to the Authors of the present review, when taking together all reported changes occurring in space, a picture emerges closely resembling the so-called aging male syndrome, which is currently the object of daily screening and clinical care in their endocrine unit, so that microgravity may become a tool for better understanding subtle mechanisms of testicular senescence.",[],Journal of endocrinological investigation,2006-06-09,"[{'lastname': 'Strollo', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine and Metabolic Department, INRCA-IRCCS, 00189 Rome, Italy. strofe@flashnet.it'}, {'lastname': 'Boitani', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Basciani', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pecorelli', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Palumbo', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Borgia', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Masini', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morè', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Strollo', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Spera', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Uva', 'firstname': 'B M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Riondino', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc430ef0>
79,16619267,Reduction of anabolic signals and alteration of osteoblast nuclear morphology in microgravity.,"Bone loss has been repeatedly documented in astronauts after flight, yet little is known about the mechanism of bone loss in space flight. Osteoblasts were activated during space flight in microgravity (microg) with and without a 1 gravity (1 g) field and 24 genes were analyzed for early induction. Induction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), cpla2, osteocalcin (OC), c-myc, fibroblast growth factor-2 (fgf-2), bcl2, bax, and fgf-2 message as well as FGF-2 protein were significantly depressed in microg when compared to ground (gr). Artificial onboard gravity normalized the induction of c-myc, cox-2, TGFbeta, bax, bcl2, and fgf-2 message as well as FGF-2 protein synthesis in spaceflight samples. In normal gravity, FGF-2 induces bcl2 expression; we found that bcl2 expression was significantly reduced in microgravity conditions. Since nuclear shape is known to elongate in the absence of mitogens like FGF-2, we used high-resolution image-based morphometry to characterize changes in osteoblast nuclear architecture under microgravity, 1 g flight, and ground conditions. Besides changes in cell shape (roundish/elliptic), other high-resolution analyses show clear influences of gravity on the inner nuclear structure. These changes occur in the texture, arrangement, and contrast of nuclear particles and mathematical modeling defines the single cell classification of the osteoblasts. Changes in nuclear structure were evident as early as 24 h after exposure to microgravity. This documented alteration in nuclear architecture may be a direct result of decreased expression of autocrine and cell cycle genes, suggesting an inhibition of anabolic response in microg. Life on this planet has evolved in a normal gravity field and these data suggest that gravity plays a significant role in regulation of osteoblast transcription.",[],Journal of cellular biochemistry,2006-04-19,"[{'lastname': 'Hughes-Fulford', 'firstname': 'Millie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Northern California Institute for Research and Education, San Francisco, California, USA. milliehf@aol.com'}, {'lastname': 'Rodenacker', 'firstname': 'Karsten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jütting', 'firstname': 'Uta', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",10.1002/jcb.20883,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc438f90>

Obviously, downturn of food consumption, renal excretion and the intestine output seem to be caused by suppression of activity of mechanisms of ion deposition. The most intensive changes of the liquid milieu volumes occur in the first days of weightlessness or in its ground simulation. And, with prolonged duration, the changes of extracellular liquid volume and the volume of plasma do not extend. After termination of long space flights, activation of renin-aldosterone systems occurs as well as a decrease in efficiency of antidiuretic hormone, misbalance of pressor/unpressor prostanoids.

81,16447954,[Muscle atrophy in microgravity and during its simulation].,"Summarized are the results of comparative analysis of morphological changes in rat's skeletal muscles after microgravity and its simulation. On completion of space flight, hindlimb muscles of rats exhibited atrophy developed in space microgravity in consequence of the lack of weight-bearing loads and changes solely in the slow anti-g muscles due to the hemodynamic disorders appearing after space flight. Immobilization combined with clinostatting cannot be a veridical laboratory model of microgravity, as horizontally positioned animals still possess weight and, besides, experience severe chronic stress of immobilization. Tail suspension with the head-end permanently down and the hind limbs out of use appeared the most demonstrative model of the space microgravity effects. With this model, the hindlimb muscles underwent changes identical to what had been observed in space flown animals. Data of the simulation studies suggest stabilization of muscle atrophy at a certain level and an earlier and stronger reaction to the hindlimb unloading in young rats as compared to old animals.

82,16231455,Effect of space flight and head-down bedrest on neuroendocrine response to metabolic stress in physically trained subjects.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of plasma epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) responses to insulin induced hypoglycemia (ITT) 3 weeks before the space flight (SF), on the 5th day of SF, on the 2nd and 16th days after the landing in the first Slovak astronaut, and before and on the 5th day of prolonged subsequent head-down (-6 degrees) bed rest (BR) in 15 military aircraft pilots. Blood samples during the test were collected via cannula inserted into cubital vein, centrifuged in the special appliance Plasma-03, frozen in Kryogem-03, and at the end of the 8-day space flight transferred to Earth in special container for hormonal analysis. Insulin hypoglycemia was induced by i.v. administration of 0.1 IU/kg BW insulin (Actrapid HM) in bolus. Insulin administration led to a comparable hypoglycemia in pre-flight, in-flight conditions and before and after bed rest. ITT led to a pronounced increase in EPI levels and moderate increase in NE in pre-flight studies. However, an evidently reduced EPI response was found after insulin administration during SF and during BR. Thus, during the real microgravity in SF and simulated microgravity in BR, insulin-induced hypoglycemia activates the adrenomedullary system to less extent than at conditions of the Earth gravitation. Post-flight changes in EPI and NE levels did not significantly differ from those of pre-flight since SF was relatively short (8 days) and the readaptation to Earth gravitation was fast. It seems, that an increased blood flow in brain might be responsible for the reduced EPI response to insulin. Responses to ITT in physically fit subjects indicate the stimulus specificity of deconditioning effect of 5 days bed rest on stress response. Thus, the data indicate that catecholamine responses to ITT are reduced after exposure to real as well as simulated microgravity.",[],Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,2005-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Kvetnanský', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia. ueenkvet@savba.sk'}, {'lastname': 'Ksinantová', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koska', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Noskov', 'firstname': 'V B', 'initials': 'VB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vigas', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grigoriev', 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Macho', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc44f2c0>
83,16101465,Benefit of repeated receptor stimulation as a spaceflight medical tool to promote cardiovascular fitness: different orthostatic paradigms compared.,"We used various orthostatic stimulus combinations to better understand the physiology and countermeasure potential of repeated change of body position in humans. The purpose of the investigations reported was threefold: To investigate cardiovascular and hormonal effects of repeated transition between partially antiorthostatic (-30 degrees HDT) and partially head-up passive body tilt (+30 degrees HUT). Protocol Y denotes the repeated transition between these two body positions; To apply, in the same test persons, repeated transition between supine and passive upright (Protocol X), and to compare the effect of the two protocols; To find out which stimulus pattern provides the largest physiological effects and, hence, presumably the largest countermeasure potential. We chose our tilt protocol according to tilt angle sine ranges: The sine difference is 1.0 both in Protocol X (sine=0 vs. sine=1.0) and Y (sine= -0.5 vs. sine= +0.5) since this difference, and not the angle change per se, determines hydrostatic effect intensities. Due to longer-lasting neurohormonal effects elicited by tilting procedures, they all should be a useful countermeasure against post-immobilization orthostatic instability, a conjecture not yet been tested in this specific form. Therefore, one of the questions asked in this study were if movement between the two defined body positions produces similar changes when employing Protocol X vs. Protocol Y.",[],Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2005-08-17,"[{'lastname': 'Hinghofer-Szalkay', 'firstname': 'Helmut', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physiology, Medical University, Harrachgasse 21, A-8010 Graz, Austria. helmut.hinghofer@meduni-graz.at'}, {'lastname': 'Rössler', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.2174/1389201054553707,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc458400>

The study included four space shuttle missions and 25 astronauts. Nine non-astronauts served as controls. Blood specimens were collected 10 days before launch, within 3h after landing, and again 3 days after landing. The number of monocytes did not differ significantly over the interval sampled in both the astronaut or control groups. However, following 5-11 days of spaceflight, the astronauts' monocytes exhibited reductions in ability to engulf Escherichia coli, elicit an oxidative burst, and degranulate. The phagocytic index was significantly reduced following spaceflight when compared to control values. This reduction in phagocytosis was accompanied by changes in the expression of two surface markers involved in phagocytosis, CD32 and CD64.

We therefore tested the efficacy of flywheel resistive exercise and pamidronate to counteract such losses. Twenty five young healthy males underwent strict bed rest with -6 degrees head-down tilt for 90 days. Subjects were randomized into an exercise group that practiced resistive exercise with a 'flywheel' (FW) device every 2-3 days, a pamidronate group (Pam) that received 60 mg pamidronate i.v. 14 days prior to bed rest and a control group (Ctrl) that received none of these countermeasures. During the study, Ca(++) and protein intake were controlled. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was used to assess bone mineral content (BMC) and muscle cross sectional area (mCSA) of calf and forearm. Measurements were taken twice during baseline data collection, after 28 and after 89 days bed rest, and after 14 days recovery. On the same days, urinary Pyridinoline excretion and serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, Ca(++) and PTH were measured. Pre-study exercise habits were assessed through the Freiburg questionnaire. Losses in calf mCSA were significantly reduced in FW (Ctrl: -25.6% +/- 2.5% Pam: -25.6% +/- 3.7%, FW: -17.3% +/- 2.7%), but not in the forearm mCSA (Ctrl: -6.4% +/- 4.33%, Pam: -7.7% +/- 4.1%, FW: -7.6% +/- 3.3%). Both diaphyseal and epiphyseal BMC losses of the tibia were mitigated in Pam and FW as compared to Ctrl, although this was significant only at the diaphysis. Inter-individual variability was significantly greater for changes in BMC than in mCSA, and correlation of BMC losses was poor among different locations of the tibia. A significant positive correlation was found between change in tibia epiphyseal BMC and serum cortisol levels. These findings suggest that both countermeasures are only partly effective to preserve BMC (FW and Pam) and mCSA (FW) of the lower leg during bed rest. The partial efficacy of flywheel exercise as well as the bones' response to unloading per se underlines the importance of mechanical stimuli. The huge variability of BMC changes, however, suggests that other factors affect changes in whole-bone strength following acute mechanical disuse.",[],Bone,2005-04-07,"[{'lastname': 'Rittweger', 'firstname': 'Jörn', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Muscle and Bone Research, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany. j.rittweger@mmu.ac.uk'}, {'lastname': 'Frost', 'firstname': 'Harold M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schiessl', 'firstname': 'Hans', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ohshima', 'firstname': 'Hiroshi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Alkner', 'firstname': 'Björn', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tesch', 'firstname': 'Per', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Felsenberg', 'firstname': 'Dieter', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.bone.2004.11.014,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc3b3590>
87,15647814,"Bone markers, calcium metabolism, and calcium kinetics during extended-duration space flight on the mir space station.","Bone loss is a current limitation for long-term space exploration. Bone markers, calcitropic hormones, and calcium kinetics of crew members on space missions of 4-6 months were evaluated. Spaceflight-induced bone loss was associated with increased bone resorption and decreased calcium absorption.
Bone loss is a significant concern for the health of astronauts on long-duration missions. Defining the time course and mechanism of these changes will aid in developing means to counteract these losses during space flight and will have relevance for other clinical situations that impair weight-bearing activity.
We report here results from two studies conducted during the Shuttle-Mir Science Program. Study 1 was an evaluation of bone and calcium biochemical markers of 13 subjects before and after long-duration (4-6 months) space missions. In study 2, stable calcium isotopes were used to evaluate calcium metabolism in six subjects before, during, and after flight. Relationships between measures of bone turnover, biochemical markers, and calcium kinetics were examined.
Pre- and postflight study results confirmed that, after landing, bone resorption was increased, as indicated by increases in urinary calcium (p < 0.05) and collagen cross-links (N-telopeptide, pyridinoline, and deoxypyridinoline were all increased >55% above preflight levels, p < 0.001). Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D metabolites were unchanged at landing. Biochemical markers of bone formation were unchanged at landing, but 2-3 weeks later, both bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin were significantly (p < 0.01) increased above preflight levels. In studies conducted during flight, bone resorption markers were also significantly higher than before flight. The calcium kinetic data also validated that bone resorption was increased during flight compared with preflight values (668 +/- 130 versus 427 +/- 153 mg/day; p < 0.001) and clearly documented that true intestinal calcium absorption was significantly lower during flight compared with preflight values (233 +/- 87 versus 460 +/- 47 mg/day; p < 0.01). Weightlessness had a detrimental effect on the balance in bone turnover such that the daily difference in calcium retention during flight compared with preflight values approached 300 mg/day (-234 +/- 102 versus 63 +/- 75 mg/day; p < 0.01).
These bone marker and calcium kinetic studies indicated that the bone loss that occurs during space flight is a consequence of increased bone resorption and decreased intestinal calcium absorption.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2005-01-14,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Scott M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Human Adaptation and Countermeasures Office, NASA Lyndon B.

The effect of direction of rotation on cortisol, melatonin, and rectal temperature was examined in participants randomly assigned to either a CW (n = 14) or CCW (n = 14) shift rotation.
Results revealed lower amplitude [F(1,21) = 14.6, p < 0.05] and a delay of the acrophase [F(1,21) = 4.4, p < 0.05] in temperature for the CCW group. Sample time effects for cortisol and melatonin revealed normal circadian variation for both rotations, although melatonin levels on the midnight shift were clearly suppressed relative to baseline melatonin levels.
The changes observed in the temperature rhythm for the CCW rotation may be related to adaptation or shift-work hardiness; however, it is unclear if these differences indicate beneficial or detrimental changes for the individual. The fact that there were no significant effects of rotation condition for cortisol or melatonin argues against a detrimental effect. These findings are bolstered by performance and sleep data, reported elsewhere from this study, indicating a lack of significant differences as a function of rotation condition.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2004-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Boquet', 'firstname': 'Albert', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, AAM-510, P.O.

89,15486040,Plasma volume restoration with salt tablets and water after bed rest prevents orthostatic hypotension and changes in supine hemodynamic and endocrine variables.,"Head-down bed rest changes the values of many cardiovascular and endocrine variables and also elicits significant hypovolemia. Because previous studies had not controlled for hypovolemia, it is unknown whether the reported changes were primary effects of bed rest or secondary effects of bed rest-induced hypovolemia. We hypothesized that restoring plasma volume with salt tablets and water after 12 days of head-down bed rest would result in an absence of hemodynamic and endocrine changes and a reduced incidence of orthostatic hypotension. In 10 men, we measured changes from pre-bed-rest to post-bed-rest in venous and arterial pressures; heart rate; stroke volume; cardiac output; vascular resistance; plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, renin activity (PRA), and aldosterone responses to different tilt levels (0 degrees, -10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 70 degrees); and plasma volume and platelet alpha2- and lymphocyte beta2-adrenoreceptor densities and affinities (0 degrees tilt only). Fluid loading at the end of bed rest restored plasma volume and resulted in the absence of post-bed-rest orthostatic hypotension and changes in supine hemodynamic and endocrine variables. Fluid loading did not prevent post-bed-rest increases in beta2-adrenoreceptor density or decreases in the aldosterone-to-PRA ratio (P = 0.05 for each). Heart rate, epinephrine, and PRA responses to upright tilt after bed rest were increased (P < 0.05), despite the fluid load. These results suggest that incidents of orthostatic hypotension and many of the changes in supine hemodynamic and endocrine variables in volume-depleted bed-rested subjects occur secondarily to the hypovolemia. Despite normovolemia after bed rest, beta2-adrenoreceptors were upregulated, and heart rate, epinephrine, and PRA responses to tilt were augmented, indicating that these changes are independent of volume depletion.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']",American journal of physiology.

92,14692473,Effects of mission duration on neuroimmune responses in astronauts.,"Spaceflight poses a unique stress to humans that can impair cellular immune responses and reactivate latent herpes viruses. Notably, prior studies have suggested that mission length may be an important factor in the variability of immune alterations observed after spaceflight. In this study, adrenocortical responses and circulating leukocytes were compared between astronauts who participated in either 9- or 16-d missions.
Mission duration will differentially affect neuroimmune responses after spaceflight.
Blood and urine samples, collected from 28 crew-members who flew on 5 Space Shuttle missions, were analyzed for levels of plasma and urinary cortisol, urinary catecholamines, leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets, and total IgE.
After spaceflight, plasma cortisol was significantly decreased after the 9-d missions but increased after the 16-d missions. In contrast urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were greater after the 9-d missions than the 16-d missions. Total IgE was significantly increased after the 16-d missions and correlated with urinary cortisol. The number of white blood cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and CD4+ T cells were significantly increased postflight. After the 9-d missions, monocytes were increased while natural killer cells were decreased. However, monocytes were decreased after the 16-d missions; no change occurred in natural killer cells.

93,14625203,Effects of diet and exposure to hindlimb suspension on estrous cycling in Sprague-Dawley rats.,"Various factors can disrupt the female reproductive cycle resulting in subfertility. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether physiological changes associated with exposure to hypogravity disrupt reproductive cycles. The hindlimb suspension (HLS) model was used to simulate the major physiological effects of hypogravity in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Also, to determine whether diet may influence reproductive results, rats were fed purified American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93G or chow diet. Rats (n = 9-11/group) subjected to HLS had lengthened estrous cycles due to prolonged diestrus, indicating hypoestrogenism. Interestingly, HLS rats fed AIN-93G but not chow diet had significantly reduced time spent in estrus and decreased plasma estradiol. Attenuation of hypoestrogenism in the chow-fed rats suggested that diet provided an exogenous source of estrogen. The mechanism involved in the disruption of estrous cycling remains to be determined. HLS increased urinary corticosterone (CORT) levels during the initial 4 days of HLS, suggesting that physiological responses to acute stress may be a potential mechanism in the disruption of estrous cycles. Higher basal urinary CORT was observed in rats fed chow vs. AIN-93G diet. HLS resulted in increased urinary CORT. However, two-way ANOVA indicated a significant HLS effect (P < 0.001) but no effect of HLS x diet effect on urinary CORT levels, suggesting that estrogenic activity associated with the chow diet did not enhance the stress response. The results of this study indicate that HLS, diet, and the combination of HLS and diet influence estrous cycling. This has important implications for future reproductive success in the hypogravity environment of space.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']",American journal of physiology.

Blood samples during the tests were collected via cannula inserted into cubital vein, centrifuged in the special appliance Plasma-03, frozen in Kryogem-03, and at the end of the 8-day space flight transferred to Earth in special container for hormonal analysis. Preflight workload produced an increase of plasma norepinephrine and a moderate elevation of epinephrine levels. Plasma levels of insulin, growth hormone, prolactin and cortisol were not markedly changed immediately or 10 min after the end of work load. The higher increases of plasma growth hormone, prolactin and catecholamine levels were noted after workload during space flight as compared to preflight response. The higher plasma glucose and insulin levels were noted during the oral glucose tolerance test in space flight and also in the post flight period. Plasma epinephrine levels were slightly decreasing during glucose tolerance test; however, plasma norepinephrine levels were not changed.

95,12968528,[The water-salt balance and renal function in space flights and in model experiments].,"Study of a condition of mineral and water-electrolyte metabolism, function of kidneys, and their hormonal regulation during model experiments (hypokinesia, bed rest, immersion etc.), and also in space flights and in readaptation period, has shown a major role of water-electrolyte homeostasis during general adaptation of humans and animals to new conditions of life and to conditions of weightlessness in particular. The change in regulation of volumes of fluid milieu in an initial period of weightlessness was shown to be the consequence of redistribution of blood and hemodynamics of the shifts resulting in change of production of volume-regulation hormones, formation of negative water balance, and redistribution of fluid in the organism among various fluid compartments. At later stages of flight or long-term hypokinesia, a change of water-electrolyte homeostasis occurs with a decrease in the kidneys excretion of sodium, and diuresis, but with an increased excretion of calcium and production of ADH and RAAS hormones. Following returning to earth gravitation, the majority of astronauts have adaptive reactions, compensating for the loss extracellular fluid and mineral substances and formation of ""earth"" water-electrolyte homeostasis. For estimation of water-electrolyte homeostasis and the functions of kidneys in astronauts, various functional loading tests have been developed.

96,12959131,The impact of skeletal unloading on bone formation.,"Skeletal unloading leads to decreased bone formation and decreased bone mass. Bone resorption is uncoupled from bone formation, contributing to the bone loss. During space flight bone is lost principally from the bones most loaded in the 1 g environment. Determining the mechanism(s) by which loading of bone is sensed and translated into a signal(s) controlling bone formation remains the holy grail in this field. It seems likely that matrix/cell interactions will underlie much of the mechanocoupling. Integrins are a prime mediator of such interactions. The role for systemic hormones such as PTH, GH and 1,25(OH)2D compared to locally produced factors such as IGF-I, PTHrP, BMPs and TGF beta in modulating the cellular response to load remains unclear. Our studies demonstrate that skeletal unloading leads to resistance to the anabolic actions of IGF-I on bone as a result of failure of IGF-I to activate its own signaling pathways. This is associated with a reduction in integrin expression, suggesting crosstalk between these two pathways. As the mechanism(s) by which bone responds to changes in mechanical load with changes in bone formation is further elucidated, applications of this knowledge to other etiologies of osteoporosis are likely to develop. Skeletal unloading provides a perturbation in bone mineral homeostasis that can be used to understand the mechanisms by which bone mineral homeostasis is maintained, and that such understanding will lead to effective treatment for disuse osteoporosis in addition to preventive measures for the bone loss that accompanies space travel.","['NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'Non-NASA Center']",Gravitational and space biology bulletin : publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology,2003-09-10,"[{'lastname': 'Bikle', 'firstname': 'Daniel D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. doctor@itsa.ucsf.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Sakata', 'firstname': 'Takeshi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Halloran', 'firstname': 'Bernard P', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc35ae50>
97,12722423,[Hormonal regulation of metabolism in the human body in microgravity and during simulation of its physiological effects].,"The paper presents results of investigations into the effects of space flight and simulation experiments of various length on the hormonal regulation of metabolism in the human body. Microgravity was shown to instigate shifts on different levels of the hormonal regulation and consequent adjustment of metabolism to this new environment. For instance, adaptation occurs on the level of basal secretory activity resulting in altered metabolism and formation of a pool of hormones. Metabolism readaptation to the Earth's gravity is dependent on polymorphic processes in the system of hormonal regulation developing in the course of time. Trends in the hormonal regulation of water-electrolyte metabolism during early adaptation point to inequality of contributions of the antidiuretic hormone, natriuretic peptide, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In the ground-based simulations responses of the hormonal regulation of water-electrolyte metabolism differ in intensity and types of hormones involved. Temperature variation can modify reactions of the comosis and volume regulating hormones at the beginning of adaptation. Physical-chemical regulation of calcium homeostasis in microgravity reveals itself by a rapid decline of the calcium-binding ability of blood buffers and, later on, degradation of the relative ability of extraplasmic structures to bind calcium. Qualitative and quantitative changes in the diurnal rhythm of the suprarenal steroidogenesis are indicative of modification of intensity of reactions of the main biosynthetic sequences. Countermeasures used by test-subjects in these investigations loosened significantly the aldosterone-secreting biosynthetic sequences but were favorable to the synthesis of testosterone and hydrocortisone.

Deficient loading of the musculoskeletal system in microgravity was shown to suppress the functional activity of somatotrophs, gonadotrophs and, seemingly, Leydig's cells. As a consequence, blood levels of the growth hormone and testosterone reduced in the space-flown rats. Reduction of the production of the main anabolic hormones is one of the causes for growth inhibition, prevalence of catabolism and consequent muscular atrophy and osteopenia. Simulation of the lack of weight loading inherent to the zero-g environment by suspension also leads to suppression of the somatotrophs activity, whereas the concentration and functional activity of gonadotrophs make a sharp rise. Proliferation of Leydig's cells in the testicles was noted to be very high despite desolation of the seminal canals and disintegration of the testicle epithelium.

102,12650196,Endocrine responses to space flights.,"Simultaneously with human space flights several series of observations were performed by using experimental animals--mainly rats--exposed to space flights on board of special satellites BION-COSMOS or in Shuttle Transportation Systems (STS). The aims of these experiments were to study in more details: the mechanisms of the changes in bones and skeletal muscle, the alterations of the function of immune system, the radiation effects on organism, the mechanism of the changes of endocrine functions, the evaluation of the role of hormones in alteration of metabolic processes in organism. The advantages of these animal experiments were the possibilities to analyze not only the plasma samples, but it was possible to obtain samples of organs or tissues: for morphological and biochemical analysis for studies of the changes in enzyme activities and in gene expressions, for measurement of metabolic processes and for investigation of the hormone production in endocrine glands and estimation of the response of tissues to hormones. It was also possible to compare the endocrine response to spaceflight and to other stress stimuli. These animal studies are interesting for verification of some hypothesis in the mechanism of adaptation of human organism to the changes of gravity.

103,12568289,Effect of Kampo herbal medicines on murine water metabolism in a microgravity environment.,"To determine the possibility of new applications of Oriental medicines, we examined the changes in water metabolism of mice that underwent microgravity and were treated with Kampo medicines. Male ICR mice were used in this experiment. Eight extracts of Kampo herbal medicines were dissolved in water and added to the drinking water administered to mice at 1 g/kg body weight for two days. The microgravity experiment was performed at the Japan Microgravity Center. We used a drop-shaft type microgravity experimental system with a free fall of 490 m. Before the drop, 7 ml of physiological saline was injected intraperitoneally. Under fasting and dehydration, body weights were measured and loss of body weight was calculated as urine. Blood samples were collected 24 hours after the microgravity experiment, and the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in plasma related to water metabolism was measured by the radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. Heat shock protein in the spleen was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosolvent assay (ELISA) method. In the Hachimi-jio-gan and Hochu-ekki-to groups in microgravity, a decrease of urine was observed, which significantly suppressed the increase of ADH due to microgravity. Hachimi-jio-gan reduced the content of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in the spleen. It is suggested that Hachimi-jio-gan and Hochu-ekki-to could be used as water metabolism adjustment reagents in a space environment. Furthermore, it is suggested that Hachimi-jio-gan could ease the stresses caused by microgravity. The physiological changes resulting from a microgravity environment are serious problems for space flight.

104,12496678,Microgravity as a model of ageing.,"Longevity with good health and long-term survival in space are two of the many challenges that scientists face in the twenty-first century. Ageing and life in space are both associated with undesirable effects on normal physiological processes. This review will outline how the endocrine, metabolic, immune and musculoskeletal systems are affected by microgravity and ageing, drawing analogies between the observed changes in an attempt to highlight common mechanisms.
Mild hypothyroidism, increased stress hormones (mainly catecholamines), decreased sex steroids, insulin resistance, impaired anabolic response to food intake, anorexia, altered mitochondrial function and systemic inflammatory response are common features of both ageing and microgravity. Both conditions lead to progressive bone and muscle atrophy, compromising mobility and the ability to perform essential daily tasks. In skeletal muscle, both ageing and space flight lead to weakness from whole muscle to single fibre level, accompanied by marked alterations in muscle architecture and in tendon mechanical properties.
What makes microgravity an interesting and unique tool for gerontologists is that many space-related physiological changes resemble those observed during ageing, but are more or less quickly restored after re-entry, thus allowing the biology of ageing to be investigated both ways, not only during its development but also during recovery.",[],Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2002-12-24,"[{'lastname': 'Biolo', 'firstname': 'Gianni', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical, Morphological and Technological Sciences, Division of Internal Medicine, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy. biolo@units.it'}, {'lastname': 'Heer', 'firstname': 'Martina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Narici', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Strollo', 'firstname': 'Felice', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/00075197-200301000-00006,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc264b30>

Urinary excretion of Growth Hormone (GH), Cortisol, 6 Sulfatoxymelatonin, Normetadrenaline (NMN) and Metadrenaline (NM) was determined. A decrease in urinary cortisol excretion during the night of HDBR was noted. For GH, a rhythm was found before and during HDBR. The rhythm of melatonin, evaluated with the urine excretion of 6 Sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6S), the main hepatic metabolite, persisted throughout the experiment without any modification to the level of phase.

A low' (LS: 143 10 mM) and high' (HS: 434+/-17 mM Na+/d excreted) sodium treatment were provided in randomized order, separated > or = 1 mo. Before and at the end of HDBR, hemodynamic variables and thoracic impedance were determined, and blood was taken for aldosterone and PRA, venous hematocrit, and plasma mass density. Extracellular fluid volume and pAVP were determined every second day. Whole body electrical impedance spectroscopy was employed to assess changes in extracellular volume, hormone determinations were done with radioimmunoassay, mass density measurements with the mechanical oscillator technique.
Extracellular volume decreased with HDBR (LS: -4.0%, p=0.002; HS: -5.8%, p=0.018) without significant difference between salt treatments. Resting hormone levels were not altered by HDBR, but pAVP was lower (5.5+/-0.1 pg/ml) in HS than in LS (7.2+/-0.3 pg/ml) as was plasma aldosterone (HS: 69+/-7 pg/ml, LS: 180+/-24 pg/ml). On the other hand, HDBR reduced extracellular volume by ?5% irrespective of dietary sodium supply.

107,12361784,Microgravity and immune responsiveness: implications for space travel.,"To date, several hundred cosmonauts and astronauts have flown in space, yet knowledge about the adaptation of their immune system to space flight is rather limited. It is evident that a variety of immune parameters are changed during and after space flight, but the magnitude and pattern of these changes can differ dramatically between missions and even between crew members on the same mission. A literature search was conducted involving a total of 335 papers published between 1972 and 2002 that dealt with the key words immune response, microgravity and astronauts/cosmonauts, isolation, gravity, and human health. The data from multiple studies suggested that major discrepancies in outcome are due to methodologic differences. However, the data also suggested major factors that affect and modulate the immune response during space travel. In part at least, these discrepancies can be attributed to methodologic differences. In addition, a variety of other features, in particular the types and extent of stressors encountered during space missions, are likely to contribute to the variability of immune responses during and after space flight. That stress plays an important role in the effects of space flight on immunologic parameters is suggested by the frequent findings that stress hormones are upregulated during and after space flight. Unfortunately, however, the existing data on hormonal parameters are almost as varied as those on immunologic changes, and correlations between the two datasets have only rarely been attempted. The functional implications of space flight-induced alterations in immune response largely remain to be elucidated, but the data suggest that long-term travel will be associated with the development of immune-compromised hosts.",[],"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2002-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Borchers', 'firstname': 'Andrea T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of California at Davis School of Medicine, Davis, California 95616, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Keen', 'firstname': 'Carl L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gershwin', 'firstname': 'M Eric', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0899-9007(02)00913-9,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc2840e0>
108,12361776,Insulin secretion and sensitivity in space flight: diabetogenic effects.,"Nearly three decades of space flight research have suggested that there are subclinical diabetogenic changes that occur in microgravity. Alterations in insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and metabolism of protein and amino acids support the hypothesis that insulin plays an essential role in the maintenance of muscle mass in extended-duration space flight. Experiments in flight and after flight and ground-based bedrest studies have associated microgravity and its experimental paradigms with manifestations similar to those of diabetes, physical inactivity, and aging. We propose that these manifestations are characterized best by an etiology that falls into the clinical category of ""other"" causes of diabetes, including, but not restricted to, genetic beta-cell defects, insulin action defects, diseases of the endocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug or chemically induced diabetes, infections, immune-mediated metabolic alteration, and a host of genetic related diseases. We present data showing alterations in tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, insulin secretion, and amino acid metabolism in pancreatic islets of Langerhans cultured in a ground-based cell culture bioreactor that mimics some of the effects of microgravity. Taken together, space flight research, ground-based studies, and bioreactor studies of pancreatic islets of Langerhans support the hypothesis that the pancreas is unable to overcome peripheral insulin resistance and amino acid dysregulation during space flight. We propose that measures of insulin secretion and insulin action will be necessary to design effective countermeasures against muscle loss, and we advance the ""disposition index"" as an essential model to be used in the clinical management of space flight-induced muscle loss.","['NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2002-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Tobin', 'firstname': 'Brian W', 'initials': 'BW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Programs in Nutrition, Biochemistry, and Physiology, Department of Pediatrics, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, Georgia 31207, USA. tobin_bw@mercer.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Uchakin', 'firstname': 'Peter N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Leeper-Woodford', 'firstname': 'Sandra K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0899-9007(02)00940-1,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc289900>

110,12361771,Anorexia in space and possible etiologies: an overview.,"Space travelers experience a flight duration-dependent loss in weight and body mass while in a microgravity environment, despite the absence of increased energy expenditure. Anorexia in space can lead to in-flight caloric deficits of 1330 kcal per 70 kg astronaut per day in the presence of abundant food and has a critical effect on endurance and performance. Microgravity, alterations in the light-and-dark cycle, and exposure to radiation energy are the environmental stresses believed to influence appetite, food intake, and gastrointestinal function during space flight. Review of data and recent studies in rodents during microgravity showed a release of stress hormones and complex neuroendocrine and physiologic changes involving the modulation of hypothalamic activity, food intake-related hormones, and cytokines. The shift of dietary preference to carbohydrates, which occurs in astronauts, denotes a stress physiologic response and augments free-plasma tryptophan concentration in the brain, the precursor of the potent anorexic agent, serotonin (5-HT). Alterations of other neuroendocrine mediators, including corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), coordinate the stress response, leading to a decrease in appetite and gastrointestinal function. Our laboratories used the antiorthostatic tail-suspension technique to successfully mimic some of these anorexia-related stress responses and to directly demonstrate the role of 5-HT in microgravity-related decreased food intake and delayed gastric emptying. Further rodent studies from our laboratories demonstrated the adverse effect of altered dark-and-light cycles on food intake and body weight. Radiation energy, through its documented effects on appetite, probably contributes to the decreased caloric intake by astronauts. Modulation of hypothalamic activity, 5-HT, and CRF play a critical role in anorexia related to microgravity and circadian rhythm alterations. Specific gene knockout mice (e.g., 5-HT or CRF and their respective receptors) may prove fruitful in defining the pathways by which anorexia in space occurs. An understanding of these pathophysiologic problems as they relate to appetite, food intake, gastric emptying and gastrointestinal function, sufficiently to derive successful practical solutions, may lead to a quantitative enhancement of physiologic well-being and performance status, serving as a productive countermeasure in space.",[],"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2002-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Da Silva', 'firstname': 'Monica S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Surgical Metabolism and Nutrition Laboratory, Neuroscience Program, Department of Surgery, SUNY Upstate Medial University, Syracuse, New York 13210, USA. dasilvam@upstate.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Zimmerman', 'firstname': 'Pamela M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Meguid', 'firstname': 'Michael M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nandi', 'firstname': 'Jyotirmoy', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ohinata', 'firstname': 'Kosaku', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Chung', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tada', 'firstname': 'Tomoko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Inui', 'firstname': 'Akio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0899-9007(02)00915-2,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc29df90>
111,12207161,Lipopolysaccharide- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced changes in prolactin secretion and dopaminergic activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affects pituitary hormone secretion, including prolactin release, by inducing synthesis and release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Since prolactin is mainly under tonic inhibitory control of dopamine, we investigated the effect of LPS and TNF-alpha on the hypothalamic-pituitary dopaminergic system. LPS (100-250 microg/rat, i.p.) decreased serum prolactin levels after 1 or 3 h. Sulpiride, a dopaminergic antagonist, increased serum prolactin and blocked the inhibitory effect of LPS. LPS increased hypothalamic dopamine and DOPAC concentrations and the DOPAC/dopamine ratio both in mediobasal hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary. LPS also enhanced dopamine and DOPAC concentration in the anterior pituitary. LPS elevated plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine but it did not modify the concentration of epinephrine or norepinephrine in the tissues studied. The administration of TNF-alpha (i.c.v., 1 h, 100 ng/rat) decreased serum prolactin but did not affect plasma catecholamine levels. TNF-alpha did not modify the DOPAC/dopamine ratio in hypothalamus or posterior pituitary but increased dopamine and DOPAC concentrations in the anterior pituitary. Incubations of hypothalamic explants showed that TNF-alpha did not modify in vitro basal dopamine release and reduced K(+)-evoked dopamine release. On the contrary, incubations of posterior pituitaries showed that TNF-alpha significantly increased basal and K(+)-evoked dopamine release. These results indicate that LPS and TNF-alpha increase dopamine turnover in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This increase in dopaminergic activity could mediate the inhibitory effect of LPS and TNF-alpha on prolactin release. Furthermore, the increase in dopaminergic activity elicited by LPS could be mediated by an increase in hypothalamic TNF-alpha during endotoxemia.",[],Neuroimmunomodulation,2002-09-26,"[{'lastname': 'De Laurentiis', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centro de Investigaciones en Reproducción, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Pisera', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Caruso', 'firstname': 'Carla', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Candolfi', 'firstname': 'Marianela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mohn', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rettori', 'firstname': 'Valeria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Seilicovich', 'firstname': 'Adriana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"Copyright 2002 S.

112,12124184,Neural and neuroendocrine adaptations to microgravity and ground-based models of microgravity.,"The functional properties of the motor system of humans and non-human primates are readily responsive to microgravity. There is a growing body of evidence that significant adaptations occur in the spinal cord and muscle in response to prolonged exposure to microgravity. Further, there is evidence that the processing of sensory information from the periphery, particularly that input associated with the function of muscle tendons and joints, is significantly altered as a result of prolonged microgravity. We present evidence that the fundamental neural mechanisms that control the relative activity of the motor pools of a slow and fast extensor muscle is changed such that a slow, postural muscle is less readily activated during locomotion following spaceflight. Another type of change observed in mammals exposed to spaceflight relates to the release of a growth factor, called bioassayable growth hormone, which is thought to be released from the pituitary. When an individual generates a series of isometric plantarflexor contractions, the plasma levels of bioassayable growth hormone increases significantly. This response is suppressed after several days of continuous bedrest or spaceflight. These results suggest a unique neuroendocrine control system and demonstrate its sensitivity to chronic patterns of proprioceptive input associated with load-bearing locomotion.","['NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'Non-NASA Center']",Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,2002-07-19,"[{'lastname': 'Edgerton', 'firstname': 'V R', 'initials': 'VR', 'affiliation': 'Brain Research Institute and Department of Physiological Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. vre@ucla.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'R R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Recktenwald', 'firstname': 'M R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hodgson', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kozlovskaya', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc235c20>

114,11908886,Influence of microgravity on plasma levels of gastroenteropancreatic peptides: a case study.,"No data are available about the short- or long-term influences of microgravity in space on the release of gastroenteropancreatic peptides, although these peptides are involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal functions.
Fasting plasma samples were gained during the EUROMIR-94 mission from a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut who experienced no signs of space motion sickness in orbit. Plasma concentrations of nine gastroenteropancreatic peptides were measured with sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays.
Fasting plasma levels of motilin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and secretin were increased and plasma level of cholecystokinin (CCK) was decreased by acute exposure of the astronaut to microgravity. Chronic (4 wk) exposure caused an enhancement of plasma CCK, motilin, neurotensin, VIP, and insulin whereas plasma concentrations of PP, secretin, gastrin, and somatostatin showed no changes. During the 25-d stay on MIR station plasma levels of CCK, motilin, and neurotensin increased. Short-time body rotations caused an elevation of plasma levels of PP but decreased plasma motilin.
As the influence of microgravity on the peptide levels was not uniform, an effect due to other factors (e.g., change in fluid balance or body weight) is unlikely. Moreover, adaptive changes of some peptides occurred during the stay in orbit. The release of PP and motilin seems to be very sensitive to rotation forces.

116,11845826,[Influence of gravity change on EGF-induced signal transduction].,"With the development of aerospace technology, biological effects induced by alteration of gravitation are drawing more and more attention. Among them the influence of alteration of gravitation on cytokine-induced signal transduction has been well studied recently. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced signal transduction can activate increase of cell proliferation in most cell types, so it is always a hotspot in these years. Among the early effects evoked by EGF are receptor clustering, cell rounding, and early gene expression. After the study about the induction of EGF on human A431 cell line, it was observed that EGF-induced c-fos and c-jun expression decreased in microgravity. This was caused by alteration of the EGF receptor and protein kinase C-mediated signal transduction pathways.

117,11832352,The calcium endocrine system of adolescent rhesus monkeys and controls before and after spaceflight.,"The calcium endocrine system of nonhuman primates can be influenced by chairing for safety and the weightless environment of spaceflight. The serum of two rhesus monkeys flown on the Bion 11 mission was assayed pre- and postflight for vitamin D metabolites, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, parameters of calcium homeostasis, cortisol, and indexes of renal function. Results were compared with the same measures from five monkeys before and after chairing for a flight simulation study. Concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were 72% lower after the flight than before, and more than after chairing on the ground (57%, P < 0.05). Decreases in parathyroid hormone did not reach significance. Calcitonin showed modest decreases postflight (P < 0.02). Overall, effects of spaceflight on the calcium endocrine system were similar to the effects of chairing on the ground, but were more pronounced. Reduced intestinal calcium absorption, losses in body weight, increases in cortisol, and higher postflight blood urea nitrogen were the changes in flight monkeys that distinguished them from the flight simulation study animals.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']",American journal of physiology.

Antiviral antibody titers and stress hormones were measured in plasma samples collected from 28 astronauts at their annual medical exam (baseline), 10 days before launch (L-10), landing day (R+0), and 3 days after landing (R+3). Urinary stress hormones were also measured at L-10 and R+0.
Significant increases (p <.01) in EBV virus capsid antigen antibodies were found at all three time points (L-10, R+0, and R+3) as compared with baseline samples. Anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibodies were significantly decreased at L-10 (p <.05) and continued to decrease after spaceflight (R+0 and R+3, p <.01). No changes were found in antibodies to the nonlatent measles virus. The 11 astronauts who showed evidence of EBV reactivation had significant increases in urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine as compared with astronauts without EBV reactivation.

119,11710377,Effects of space flight and IGF-1 on immune function.,"We tested the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) would ameliorate space flight-induced effects on the immune system. Twelve male, Sprague-Dawley rats, surgically implanted with mini osmotic pumps, were subjected to space flight for 10 days on STS-77. Six rats received 10 mg/kg/day of IGF-1 and 6 rats received saline. Flight animals had a lymphocytopenia and granulocytosis which were reversed by IGF-1. Flight animals had significantly higher corticosterone levels than ground controls but IGF-1 did not impact this stress hormone. Therefore, the reversed granulocytosis did not correlate with serum corticosterone. Space flight and IGF-1 also combined to induce a monocytopenia that was not evident in ground control animals treated with IGF-1 or in animals subjected to space flight but given physiological saline. There was a significant increase in spleen weights in vivarium animals treated with IGF-1, however, this change did not occur in flight animals. We observed reduced agonist-induced lymph node cell proliferation by cells from flight animals compared to ground controls. The reduced proliferation was not augmented by IGF-1 treatment. There was enhanced secretion of TNF, IL-6 and NO by flight-animal peritoneal macrophages compared to vivarium controls, however, O2(-) secretion was not affected. These data suggest that IGF-1 can ameliorate some of the effects of space flight but that space flight can also impact the normal response to IGF-1.

120,11693958,Space flight: a challenge for normal bone homeostasis.,"Space flight results in loss of bone mass, especially in weight-bearing bones, a condition that is suggested to be similar to disuse osteoporosis. As models to elucidate the underlying mechanism, bed rest studies were performed and bone metabolism in the rat both during space flight and during hindlimb unloading was investigated. The general picture is that bone formation is decreased partly as a result of reduced osteoblast function, whereas bone resorption is unaltered or increased. This deficit in bone mass can be replaced, but the time span for restoration exceeds the period of unloading. Changes in blood flow, systemic hormones, and locally produced factors are contributing in a yet undefined way to the response of osteoblastic cells to loading. The pathway by which loading and/or gravity are transduced into biochemical signals is still unknown. In vitro studies with osteoblastic cells show that their differentiation and cell morphology are altered during space flight. Elucidation of the involved signaling pathways has only recently been started. It is hoped that as the mechanisms by which bone responds to mechanical (un)loading are further understood, this insight will influence the treatment of other etiologies of osteoporosis.",[],Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,2001-11-06,"[{'lastname': 'Carmeliet', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorium voor Experimentele Geneeskunde en Endocrinologie, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Vico', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bouillon', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc1c16d0>

In space, the amplitude of the body temperature rhythm was reduced and the circadian rhythm of urinary cortisol appeared misaligned relative to the imposed non-24-h sleep-wake schedule. Neurobehavioral performance decrements were observed. Sleep duration, assessed by questionnaires and actigraphy, was only approximately 6.5 h/day. Subjective sleep quality diminished. Polysomnography revealed more wakefulness and less slow-wave sleep during the final third of sleep episodes. Administration of melatonin (0.3 mg) on alternate nights did not improve sleep. After return to earth, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was markedly increased.

122,11601551,Immune responses and latent herpesvirus reactivation in spaceflight.,"Increased frequency and severity of herpesvirus infections are common in individuals with impaired cellular immunity, a phenomenon observed in both the elderly and astronauts alike. This study investigated immune responses and latent herpesvirus reactivation during a 9-d spaceflight. In addition, adrenocortical and immune responses of an elderly astronaut (payload specialist-2, PS2; age 77) who flew on this mission were compared with that of younger crewmembers.
Spaceflight and associated stresses will decrease cellular immunity and reactivate latent herpesviruses.
Blood and urine samples, collected from the seven crewmembers who flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-95), were analyzed for levels of neuroendocrine hormones, leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets, and evidence of herpes-virus reactivation.
Prior to flight, increased antibody titers to latent Epstein-Barr virus were found. During flight, acute changes in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and cortisol resulted in a pronounced decrease in the DHEAS/cortisol ratio by the end of the mission for PS2 and a younger crewmember. Shedding of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in urine and increased CMV antibody titers also occurred inflight. At landing, the percent increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol were greatest for PS2 as compared with the other six crewmembers. A significant neutrophilia also was observed in all crewmembers. Notably, PS2 had large increases in monocytes and natural killer cells at landing while other crewmembers showed little change or a decrease.
These findings indicate that spaceflight and associated stresses reactivate latent herpesviruses and suggest that acute changes in neuroendocrine hormones mediate these changes in part by downregulating cellular immunity. Moreover, the similarities between aging and spaceflight suggest that the study of the immune system in elderly subjects may be useful as a predictive model for astronauts enduring long-term spaceflights.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2001-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Stowe', 'firstname': 'R P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0609, USA. rpstowe@bluefin.utmb.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'S K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferrando', 'firstname': 'A A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Feeback', 'firstname': 'D L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pierson', 'firstname': 'D L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Prior to flight, increased antibody titers to latent Epstein-Barr virus were found.

Ten astronauts (9 men, 1 woman) from two space shuttle missions (9- and 10-day duration) participated in the study. Blood samples were collected 10 days before launch, within 3 h after landing, and 3 days after landing. All peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations were cryopreserved and analyzed simultaneously in a 4-h cytotoxicity (51)Cr release assay using K562 target cells. NMHC killer cell lytic activity was normalized per 1,000 CD56+ cells. When all 10 subjects were considered as one study group, NMHC killer cell numbers did not change significantly during the three sampling periods, but at landing lytic activity had decreased by approximately 40% (P < 0.05) from preflight values. Nine of ten astronauts had decreased lytic activity immediately after flight. NMHC killer cell cytotoxicity of only three astronauts returned toward preflight values by 3 days after landing. Consistent with decreased NMHC killer cell cytotoxicity, urinary cortisol significantly increased after landing compared with preflight levels. Plasma cortisol and ACTH levels at landing were not significantly different from preflight values. No correlation of changes in NMHC killer cell function or hormone levels with factors such as age, gender, mission, or spaceflight experience was found.

124,11563939,Effects of exposure to space flight on endocrine regulations in experimental animals.,"This minireview summarizes the results of the observations on changes in endocrine functions of rats exposed to space flights for various periods. The results found after space flights are compared with those obtained from rats in acute or repeated restrain stress. A slight increase of plasma catecholamine levels was observed in rats after space flight of longer duration (>14 days), but no changes in catecholamine content in the activity of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes were noted in adrenal medulla and in hypothalamus. The norepinephrine content was, however, decreased in several nuclei selected from hypothalamus of flight rats. Plasma corticosterone levels were increased after space flight and morphological examination of pituitary showed elevated activity of corticotrophs. However, the plasma levels of ACTH were not increased in rats 6 hours after space flight. These changes in plasma hormone levels affected the activity of enzymes involved in metabolism of amino acids in liver and lipolysis in adipose tissue. The plasma levels of testosterone and triiodothyronine were diminished after space flight suggesting the suppression of the thyroid and gonadal activity. Increase of plasma insulin and glucose levels were found in rats after space flight, but the glucagon values were not changed. Comparing these results from flight rats with the animals exposed to acute or repeated stress indicate that long stay in microgravity do not represent very intensive stressogenic stimulus for adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenomedullar systems, and hormone alterations observed after space flight may be due to acute gravitational stress resulting from a return to Earth gravity.

125,11543082,Hindlimb-suspension and spaceflight both alter cGMP levels in rat choroid plexus.,"Effects of actual and simulated weightlessness on choroidal guanylate cyclase activity were evaluated by assaying the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger involved in mechanisms regulating the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in choroid plexus. Cyclic cGMP was measured, using radio-immunoassay, in choroidal extracts of hindlimb-suspended rats (HLS rats), adapted to an anti-orthostatic restraint for 30 min., or for 3, 9 or 14 days and after a 17-day spaceflight (Life and Microgravity SpaceLab experiment; LMS). Basal cGMP levels were slightly but significantly decreased in the first 30 min. of the HLS experiment, whereas they were significantly increased in rats adapted to longer anti-orthostatic restraints. LMS flight rats demonstrated a similar increase in the choroidal cGMP baseline. After natriuretic peptide stimulation, i.e. using ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) or BNP (brain natriuretic peptide), choroidal cGMP contents were typically increased (by 1.5-2 times; p<0.05) in control rats (LMS and HLS experiments), but not significantly elevated in suspended rats, except for those adapted to HLS for 14 days. In these animals the ANP-dependent cGMP production was significantly increased (by about 3 times; p<0.005). The ANP- or BNP-dependent responses were similarly abolished in LMS flight rats, which were dissected 4-6 hours after return to Earth's gravity. The role of corticosteroids was also investigated during the LMS experiment. Results on choroidal functions revealed a lack of significant change of cGMP levels between adrenalectomized and sham-operated rats. For the first time, it is reported that both basal and ANP- stimulated cGMP levels are dramatically changed over the first 14 days of suspension, i.e. with experiments known to simulate some effects of weightlessness. Basal choroidal cGMP levels are also increased after 17 days in space, suggesting that space adaptation also impacts choroidal guanylate cyclase activities. However, the absence of ANP-dependent cGMP increase, observed in LMS flight animals, suggests that HLS could not simulate all the spaceflight effects.

126,11542990,The endocrinology of aging and its relationship to space physiology.,"During the last century the number of people over 65 years of age has increased more than four-fold in the industrialized countries and by the year 2030 might account for 20% of the population. Life expectancy at birth is now about 75 (vs. 47 in 1900) and at 75 is 86 years. The scientific community is thus getting more and more interested in understanding the behavioral and clinical features of centenarians. During aging many endocrine systems undergo anatomic and functional changes at different times and with variable intensities, depending on individual genotypes and phenotypes. The most common finding is impaired anabolism, rather than increased catabolism, so that the hypothesis has been put forward that aging itself stems from the functional deterioration of the endocrine system. From a practical point of view, two main questions arise: (i) to which extent the endocrine glands accelerate physical decay?; (ii) may hormonal replacement ensure health at least longer than nowadays?",[],Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,2001-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Strollo', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Italian National Research Centers on Aging INRCA, Rome, Italy.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc180860>
127,11542343,Effects of the 120 days of head-down bed rest on cytokine secretion and its in vitro modulation by glucocorticoids.,"Antiorthostatic hypokinesia or head-down bed rest (HDBR), is a ground-based model system used to simulate some of the physioloical responses observed during space flight. Several studies involving humans and animals have demonstrated the effects of HDBR on different physioloical systems. HDBR produced a large thoracic fluid shift similar to that reported for space flight. Exposure to the combination of -6 degrees HDBR, emotional stress, and hypergravity led to an elevation of plasma histamine and serotinin and a dramatic decrease in the concentration of prostaglandins E, F2-alpha, and erthropoietin. These responses indicated the HDBR produces significant alterations in the neuroendocrine regulatory pathways. The proliferative response of immune cells in response to activators was significantly enhanced in antiorthostatically suspended mice; plasma corticosterone also was higher but splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity remained unchanged after suspension. Bone-resporbing activity of supernatatants increased in mitogen-stimulated PBMC cultures of subjects exposed to -5 degrees HDBR for 370 days of HDBR. Proliferative activity of PBMCs had declined at the end of a 320-day HDBR and during the initial days of recovery, but the numbers of active rosette-forming T cells increased. These and other results suggest that most stress-induced immune changes are neuroendocrine modulated, and that corticosteroids play a significant role in this modulation. It is expected that HDBR-induced immune changes could result from similar mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the effect of 120 days of HDBR on Type-1 vs. Type-2 cytokine equilibrium in mitogen-activated PBMC culture, and how these reactions may correlate with changes in the neuroendocrine status.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']",Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,2001-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Uchakin', 'firstname': 'P N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'National Research Council, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cubbage', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sams', 'firstname': 'C F', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morukov', 'firstname': 'B V', 'initials': 'BV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Larina', 'firstname': 'I V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bobrovnik', 'firstname': 'E B', 'initials': 'EB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc186db0>
128,11541904,Bone markers during a 6-month space flight: effects of vitamin K supplementation.,"Rapid bone loss is a serious health problem for astronauts during long lasting missions in space. We have recorded the changes of biochemical markers for bone metabolism in one of the astronauts during the 6-month space flight of the EUROMIR-95 mission. Immediately after launch both bone resorption markers and urinary calcium excretion increased about two fold, whereas bone formation markers remained unchanged. After 12 1/2 weeks the astronaut received vitamin K1 (10 mg/day for 6 weeks). Vitamin K is known to be involved in the formation of gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) in proteins, such as the calcium-binding bone Gla-proteins osteocalcin and matrix Gla-protein. Concomitant with the start of vitamin K treatment, the calcium-binding capacity of osteocalcin increased, and so did the urinary excretion of free Gla. This is suggestive for a subclinical vitamin K-deficiency in the astronaut before vitamin K-supplementation. During periods of high vitamin K status markers for bone formation (osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase) had increased as compared to the first part of the flight. The mean increases were 14 and 23%, respectively.

130,11541870,Agravitropic behaviour of roots of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes.,"Transgenic hairy roots of Brassica napus (cv. Omega) have been developed, using Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain AR 25, for use as a model system in the investigation of physiological and morphological differences between transgenic and normal roots. The basic parameters of growth and normal or altered gravitropical behaviour of hairy roots are for the first time presented in this paper together with an ultrastructural and morphological analysis of the root statocytes. The results obtained also represented the basis for the TRANSF0RM-experiment on the IML-2 mission performed onboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. Typical hairy root traits such as hormone-autonomous growth high growth rate, lateral branching, and changed/absence of gravitropism were detected. The transformed nature of the roots was confirmed by Southern blot analyses. The gravitropical behaviour of apices from hairy root cultures of this clone has been compared with root tips from normal seedlings. While the wild type roots curved progressively with increasing stimulation angles, the transformed roots showed no curvature when stimulated at 45 degrees, 90 degrees or 135 degrees on the ground. The morphology and ultrastructure of the root tip regions were examined by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. At the ultrastructural level no major differences could be detected between the roots studied. There was, however, a slight reduction in the starch content of most of the amyloplasts of the transgenic root tips, and the root cap was more V-shaped in the transgenic roots than in the wild type. Preliminary results from the Shuttle experiment TRANSFORM show a random distribution of amyloplasts in the root cells of both transformed and wild type root caps after 14 h on a 1xg centrifuge followed by 37 h in microgravity.",[],Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,2001-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Odegaard', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Nielsen', 'firstname': 'K M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beisvag', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Evjen', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Johnsson', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rasmussen', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Iversen', 'firstname': 'T H', 'initials': 'TH', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc0e78b0>
131,11541764,Changes in urinary excretion of pyridinium cross-links during Spacelab-J.,"In SLJ-1 we proposed to study three major objectives. They were; 1. hormonal changes associated with fluid and electrolyte metabolism, 2. the effect of space flight on the circadian rhythms of endocrine and metabolic systems, 3. the changes in the indices of the bone and muscle metabolism during space flight. In this report, the changes in the bone metabolism during Spacelab-J will be presented with a special emphasis on urinary excretion of pyridinium cross-links. Timed urine samples from three Japanese payload specialists were obtained for 3 days from May 19 to 21, 1991 (one year before the launch = L-1 year). Immediately before the launch (L-3 to L-0), urine samples were obtained from a payload specialist who was on board the Space Shuttle Endeavor (PS). During the inflight period (flight from September 3 to 10 in 1992), urine samples from the PS were collected by using Urine Monitoring System (UMS). After the landing, they were obtained from the PS for three days (R+0-R+2). Various parameters related to bone metabolism such as hydroxyproline, pyridinium cross-links and calcium were determined. It was noted that excretion of hydroxyproline decreased during the preflight periods when compared with that in the control L-1 year period. The average excretory rate during control period was 846.2 +/- 198.7 milligrams/hour (mean +/- SD), while those in the preflight 474.6 +/- 171.1 milligrams/hour, suggesting the diminished collagen intake during the preflight period. Average excretion rate of pyridinium cross-links during the first 4 mission days (MD0-MD3) was similar to that of preflight and control L-1 year period. However, it was significantly increased during the last 4 mission days (MD4-MD7). It returned to the preflight level during postflight days (R+0-R+2). Increased urinary excretion of calcium during the last 4 mission days were also observed. These results suggest that increase in bone resorption could occur during relatively short stay in microgravity.",[],Uchu Seibutsu Kagaku,2001-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Seo', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Nagoya University, Japan. hseo@riem.nagoya-u.ac.jp'}, {'lastname': 'Itoh', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Murata', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ohmori', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kambe', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mohri', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sekiguchi', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Matsui', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.2187/bss.11.321,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc0f0a40>

This altered metabolism affects both the astronauts' body composition and the nutritional requirements necessary to maintain their health. During the last 25 years, a combination of studies conducted on Skylab (the first U.S. space laboratory), U.S. Shuttle flights, and Soviet and Russian flights provides a range of data from which general conclusions about energy and protein requirements can be drawn. We have reviewed the endocrine data from those studies and related it to changes in body composition. From these data it appears that protein and energy intake of astronauts are similar to those on Earth.

134,11540639,Effects of microgravity on osteoblast growth.,"Studies from space flights over the past two decades have demonstrated that basic physiological changes occur in humans during space flight. These changes include cephalic fluid shifts, loss of fluid and electrolytes, loss of muscle mass, space motion sickness, anemia, reduced immune response, and loss of calcium and mineralized bone. The cause of most of these manifestations is not known and until recently, the general approach was to investigate general systemic changes, not basic cellular responses to microgravity. Recently analyzed data from the 1973-1974 Skylabs disclose that there is a rise in the systemic hormone, cortisol, which may play a role in bone loss in flight. In two flights where bone growth was measured (Skylabs 3 and 4), the crew members had a significant loss of calcium accompanied by a rise in 24 hour urinary cortisol during the entire flight period. In ground-based work on osteoblasts, we have demonstrated that equivalent amounts of glucocorticoids can inhibit osteoblast cell growth. In addition, this laboratory has recently studied gene growth and activation of mouse osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) during spaceflight. Osteoblast cells were grown on glass coverslips, loaded in the Biorack plunger boxes 18 hours before launch and activated 19 hours after launch in the Biorack incubator under microgravity conditions. The osteoblasts were launched in a serum deprived state, activated and collected in microgravity. Samples were collected at 29 hours after sera activation (0-g, n=4; 1-g, n=4). The osteoblasts were examined for changes in gene expression and cell morphology. Approximately one day after growth activation, remarkable differences were observed in gene expression in 0-g and 1-g flight samples. The 0-g activated cells had increased c-fos mRNA when compared to flight 1-g controls. The message of immediate early growth gene, cox-2 was decreased in the microgravity activated cells when compared to ground or 1-g flight controls. Cox-1 was not detected in any of the samples. There were no significant differences in the expression of actin mRNA between the 0-g and 1-g samples. These data indicate that quiescent osteoblasts are slower to enter the cell cycle in microgravity, suggesting that the force of gravity itself may be a significant factor in bone loss in spaceflight. Preliminary data from our STS 76 flight experiment support our hypothesis that a basic biological response occurs at the tissue, cellular, and molecular level in 0-g. Here we examine ground-based and space flown data on osteoblast growth in ground-based experiments mimicking space flight conditions and in microgravity to simulate lack of gravity stress to help us understand the mechanism of bone loss by experiments.","['NASA Discipline Cell Biology', 'NASA Experiment Number 9403056', 'Non-NASA Center']",Gravitational and space biology bulletin : publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology,2001-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Hughes-Fulford', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Laboratory of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Veteran's Administration Medical Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Tjandrawinata', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fitzgerald', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gasuad', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gilbertson', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc106a90>
135,11532705,Renal hemodynamics in space.,"Renal excretory function and hemodynamics are determined by the effective circulating plasma volume as well as by the interplay of systemic and local vasoconstrictors and vasodilators. Microgravity results in a headward shift of body fluid. Because the control conditions of astronauts were poorly defined in many studies, controversial results have been obtained regarding diuresis and natriuresis as well as renal hemodynamic changes in response to increased central blood volume, especially during the initial phase of space flight. Renal excretory function and renal hemodynamics in microgravity are affected in a complex fashion, because during the initial phase of space flight, variable mechanisms become operative to modulate the effects of increased central blood volume. They include interactions between vasodilators (dopamine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and prostaglandins) and vasoconstrictors (sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system). The available data suggest a moderate rise in glomerular filtration rate during the first 2 days after launch without a significant increase in effective renal plasma flow. In contrast, too few data regarding the effects of space flight on renal function during the first 12 hours after launch are available and are, in addition, partly contradictory. Thus, detailed and well-controlled studies are required to shed more light on the role of the various factors besides microgravity that determine systemic and renal hemodynamics and renal excretory function during the different stages of space flight.",[],American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2001-09-05,"[{'lastname': 'Kramer', 'firstname': 'H J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Renal Section, Medical Policlinic/Department of Medicine, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany. hkramer@uni-bonn.de'}, {'lastname': 'Heer', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cirillo', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'De Santo', 'firstname': 'N G', 'initials': 'NG', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1053/ajkd.2001.27754,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc113360>

This review outlines ground models of microgravity simulation, summarizes the major effects of weightlessness on body composition, protein metabolism, hormonal pattern, and muscle function, and addresses contradictory findings related to the oxidative stress secondary to space flight.

Blood samples were obtained 37 and 13 days before, at days 13, 34, and 41 during, and 12, 33, and 47 days after HDT. FACScan analysis was used to determine cell subpopulations. Plasma was used to quantify various circulating hormone levels. Whole blood and reconstituted blood were stimulated with various activators such as phytohaemagglutinin-P (PHA), PHA combined with phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), anti-CD2, anti-CD3, and lipopolysaccharide. Supernatants were collected and analysed for the interleukins IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The total number of T lymphocytes and monocytes did not change significantly, whereas the number of polymorphonuclear cells increased during HDT. The percentage of CD2+ and CD3+ cells was increased at day 35 of HDT. The percentage and total number of natural killer cells (CD2+/CD3-/CD56+) was increased 12 days before and 14 days after HDT. TNF-alpha secretion did not change significantly during HDT. IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-gamma were increased at day 34 of HDT. IL-1beta levels were increased before and during HDT compared to post-HDT measurements. No significant changes were observed in plasma immunoglobulin, complement factors and other factors of the inflammatory system. Prolactin levels increased slightly but significantly at day 35 of HDT, thyreotropin and growth hormone levels remained virtually unchanged. Cortisol decreased slightly but significantly over the entire duration of the study. The changes observed during HDT do not indicate that the immune system is blunted, and these changes do not seem to correlate with the duration of HDT.

138,11200983,Body fluid regulation in micro-gravity differs from that on Earth: an overview.,"Similar to the response to central hypervolemic conditions on Earth, the shift of blood volume from the legs to the upper part of the body in astronauts entering micro-gravity should, in accordance with the Henry-Gauer mechanism, mediate diuresis and natriuresis. However, fluid balance and kidney function experiments during various space missions resulted in the surprising observation that the responses qualitatively differ from those observed during simulations of hypervolemia on Earth. There is some evidence that the attenuated responses of the kidney while entering weightlessness, and also later during space flight, may be caused by augmented fluid distribution to extravascular compartments compared to conditions on Earth. A functional decoupling of the kidney may also contribute to the observation that renal responses during exposure to micro-gravity are consistently weaker than those during simulation experiments before space flight. Deficits in body mass after landing have always been interpreted as an indication of absolute fluid loss early during space missions. However, recent data suggest that body mass changes during space flight are rather the consequences of hypocaloric nutrition and can be overcome by improved nutrition schemes. Finally, sodium-retaining humoral systems are activated during space flight and may contribute to a new steady-state of metabolic balances with a pronounced increase in body sodium compared to respective conditions on Earth. A revision of the classical ""micro-gravity fluid shift"" scheme is required.",[],Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2001-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Drummer', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institut für Luft-und Raumfahrtmedizin, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt, Cologne, Germany. christian.drummer@dlr.de'}, {'lastname': 'Gerzer', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Baisch', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Heer', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s004240000335,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc0b10e0>
139,11200981,Orthostatic stress is necessary to maintain the dynamic range of cardiovascular control in space.,"In the upright position, gravity fills the low-pressure systems of human circulation with blood and interstitial fluid in the sections below the diaphragm. Without gravity one pressure component in the vessels disappears and the relationship between hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure, which regulates fluid passage across the capillary endothelium in the terminal vascular bed, shifts constantly. The visible consequences of this are a puffy face and ""bird"" legs. The plasma volume shrinks in space and the range of cardiovascular control is reduced. When they stand up for the first time after landing, 30-50% of astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance. It remains unclear whether microgravity impairs cardiovascular reflexes, or whether it is the altered volume status that causes the cardiovascular instability following space flight. Lower body negative pressure was used in several space missions to stimulate the cardiovascular reflexes before, during and after a space flight. The results show that cardiovascular reflexes are maintained in microgravity. However, the astronauts' volume status changed in space, towards a volume-retracted state, as measurements of fluid-regulating hormones have shown. It can be hypothesized that the control of circulation and body fluid homeostasis in humans is adapted to their upright posture in the Earth's gravitational field. Autonomic control regulates fluid distribution to maintain the blood pressure in that posture, which most of us have to cope with for two-thirds of the day. A determined amount of interstitial volume is necessary to maintain the dynamic range of cardiovascular control in the upright posture; otherwise orthostatic intolerance may occur more often.","['NASA Discipline Cardiopulmonary', 'Non-NASA Center']",Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2001-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Baisch', 'firstname': 'J F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Institut für Luft- und Raumfahrtmedizin, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, Cologne, Germany. friedhelm.baisch@dlr.de'}, {'lastname': 'Wolfram', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beck', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Drummer', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Störmer', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Buckey', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Blomqvist', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s004240000381,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc0b6770>
140,11122321,Water and sodium balances and their relation to body mass changes in microgravity.,"Since the very beginning of space physiology research, the deficit in body mass that is often observed after landing has always been interpreted as an indication of the absolute fluid loss early during space missions. However, in contrast to central hypervolemic conditions on Earth, the acute shift of blood volume from the legs to the upper part of the body in astronauts entering microgravity (microG) has neither stimulated diuresis and natriuresis nor resulted in negative water-and sodium-balances.
We therefore examined the kinetics of body mass changes in astronauts (n = 3) during their several weeks aboard the space station MIR. A continuous diet monitoring was performed during the first mission (EuroMIR94, 30 days). The second mission (MIR97, 19 days) comprised a 15-day metabolic ward period (including predefined constant energy and sodium intake). Water and sodium balances were calculated and the kinetic of changes in basal concentrations of fluid-balance-related hormones during flight were determined.

To evaluate the effect of microgravity on intestinal calcium absorption and calcium-regulating hormones under metabolic ward conditions.
Fractional calcium absorption (Fc240 in percentage of dose administered) was determined pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight, by use of a stable strontium test in one cosmonaut who spent 20 days in space. Moreover, a sequence of blood samples was collected for the determination of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcitriol and serum C-telopeptide (CTx, biomarker of bone resorption) levels. During all periods of data collection, calcium intake was held constant at a minimum level of 1.000 mg day(-1) and a daily supplement of 16.6 microg vitamin D2 was given. Personal ultraviolet (UV) light exposure was measured during the whole mission using a biologically weighting UV dosimeter.
Fc240 was markedly reduced on flight day 19 (4.4%) as compared to pre-flight and post-flight data (13.4% and 17.2%, respectively).

Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and urinary iodine excretion from space crews were measured following modification of the Space Shuttle potable water system to remove most of the iodine.
Mean TSH significantly increased in 134 astronauts who had consumed iodinated water during spaceflight. Serum TSH, and urine iodine levels of Space Shuttle crewmembers who flew following modification of the potable water supply system to remove iodine did not show a statistically significant change. There was no evidence supporting association between clinical thyroid disease and the number of spaceflights, amount of iodine consumed, or duration of iodine exposure.
It is suggested that pharmacological doses of iodine consumed by astronauts transiently decrease thyroid function, as reflected by elevated serum TSH values. Although adverse effects of excess iodine consumption in susceptible individuals are well documented, exposure to high doses of iodine during spaceflight did not result in a statistically significant increase in long-term thyroid disease in the astronaut population.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2000-11-22,"[{'lastname': 'McMonigal', 'firstname': 'K A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Space and Life Sciences Directorate, NASA-Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058, USA. kathleen.a.mcmonigal1@jsc.nasa.gov'}, {'lastname': 'Braverman', 'firstname': 'L E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dunn', 'firstname': 'J T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stanbury', 'firstname': 'J B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wear', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hamm', 'firstname': 'P B', 'initials': 'PB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sauer', 'firstname': 'R L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Billica', 'firstname': 'R D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pool', 'firstname': 'S L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Mean TSH significantly increased in 134 astronauts who had consumed iodinated water during spaceflight.

143,11086665,Dietary salt and urinary calcium excretion in a human bed rest spaceflight model.,"Dietary salt is known to increase the excretion of urinary calcium (Ca). To determine the potential role of dietary sodium (Na) on the calciuria associated with a spaceflight simulation model, we evaluated urinary Ca in two groups of bed rest subjects fed either high or low normal amounts of salt.
We analyzed urinary Ca excretion expressed in terms of creatinine (UCa/Cr), fractional Ca excretion (FECa), and urinary cAMP (UCAMP) as an index of parathyroid function, in the urine of 30-50-yr-old male volunteers for 6 degrees head down tilt bed rest studies. Dietary Na was in the high normal range (190 mmol x d(-1)) in 8 men for 7 d (HiNa), and in the low normal range (114 mmol x d(-1)) in 11 men for 30 d (LoNa) bed rest. Dietary Ca averaged 20 mmol x d(-1) in both studies.
Within the first 3 bed rest days, subjects in the HiNa study showed increases in UCa/Cr (0.1130 +/- 0.05 to 0.161 +/- 0.05, p < 0.002) and in FECa (1.95 +/- 0.70 to 3.19 +/- 0.93, p < 0.001); those in LoNa showed no change in UCa/Cr (0.125 +/- 0.06 to 0.121 +/- 0.07, NS) or FECa (1.93 +/- 0.75 to 2.22 +/- 0.63). After the 5th bed rest day UCa/Cr stabilized at similar levels in both dietary groups. UCAMP decreased 20% during the first week of bed rest with HiNa, but not until the third week with LoNa diets (p < 0.05).

144,10902934,Orthostatic tolerance and hormonal changes in women during 120 days of head-down bed rest.,"Women will be included as mission specialists in the upcoming International Space Station program. This paper describes the changes in volume-regulating hormones and determines the degree of degradation in orthostatic tolerance in a group of women after 120 d of bed rest. The aim of this study was to test a countermeasure program to be used by women during long-duration spaceflights.
For 120 d of -6 degrees head-down bed rest (HDBR), eight healthy women were assigned either to a no-countermeasure (No-CM, n = 4), or to a countermeasure (CM, n = 4) group. In the countermeasure group, exercise began after 2 wk, pharmacological agents were given during the 1st and 3rd mo, and the ""Centaur"" suit was worn on the last day of bed rest and during the day time for several days after bed rest. Diet supplements were taken during the 1st and 4th mo of HDBR. Tilt tests were run before and after HDBR.
After the HDBR, none of the CM subjects, had pre-syncopal or syncopal symptoms during tilt tests: BP was well maintained in the CM group, while heart rate and BP changed in the No-CM group. In plasma, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increased in both groups and remained high throughout HDBR, while aldosterone increased and remained elevated in the No-CM group. Natriuresis was decreased during HDBR.

145,10893679,Spaceflight inhibits bone formation independent of corticosteroid status in growing rats.,"Bone formation and structure have been shown repeatedly to be altered after spaceflight. However, it is not known whether these changes are related to a stress-related altered status of the corticosteroid axis. We investigated the role of corticosteroids on spaceflight-induced effects in rat pelvis and thoracic vertebrae. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to a flight, flight control, or vivarium group (n = 12/group). Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in six rats per group, the additional six rats undergoing sham surgery. Adrenalectomized (ADX) rats were implanted with corticosteroid pellets. On recovery from spaceflight, thoracic vertebrae and the whole pelvis were removed and processed for biochemistry, histomorphometry, or bone cell culture studies. The 17-day spaceflight resulted in decreased bone volume (BV) in the cotyle area of pelvic bones (-12%; p < 0.05) associated with approximately 50% inhibition of bone formation in the cancellous area of pelvic metaphyses and in thoracic vertebral bodies. The latter effect was associated with a decreased number of endosteal bone cells isolated from the bone surface (BS) in these samples (-42%; p < 0.05). This also was associated with a decreased number of alkaline phosphatase positive (ALP+) endosteal bone cells at 2 days and 4 days of culture, indicating decreased osteoblast precursor cell recruitment. Maintaining basal serum corticosterone levels in flight-ADX rats did not counteract the impaired bone formation in vertebral or pelvic bones. Moreover, the decreased ex vivo number of total and ALP+ endosteal bone cells induced by spaceflight occurred independent of endogenous corticosteroid hormone levels. These results indicate that the microgravity-induced inhibition of bone formation and resulting decreased trabecular bone mass in specific areas of weight-bearing skeleton in growing rats occur independently of endogenous glucocorticoid secretion.",[],Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2000-07-14,"[{'lastname': 'Zerath', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'INSERM Unité 349, Cell and Molecular Biology of Bone and Cartilage, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Holy', 'firstname': 'X', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roberts', 'firstname': 'S G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Andre', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Renault', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hott', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marie', 'firstname': 'P J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1359/jbmr.2000.15.7.1310,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc038a90>
146,10776450,Cyclic AMP-receptor responses to hypergravity.,"Altered gravity (G) encountered during spaceflight causes physiologic changes in humans and in experimental animals. In addition to weightlessness (0G) in space, sharply increased G forces are exerted on the spacecraft during the lift-off and reentry phases. Previous studies showed major changes in cAMP-associated activity of rat heart muscle after spaceflight, indicating that (hormone) signaling pathways may have been affected.
The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that cAMP-related cellular responses of exocrine glands after simulated hypergravity (centrifugation at 1.7G) differ from the effects of 0G.
A portion of the parotid and lachrymal gland tissue was fixed for morphologic and immunocytochemical study, and another was used for biochemical determinations. A short-term tissue culture was established from each gland to determine the effects of stimulation by norepinephrine. Heart muscle (ventricle) was also studied. Soluble and particulate fraction extracts of tissue homogenates were prepared, photoaffinity labeled with the [32P]8-N3-analog of cAMP, proteins separated by electrophoresis and the cAMP-reactive proteins (cARP) identified by autoradiography.
Differences were seen in protein banding patterns of the gland extracts and in altered cARP distribution in the 1.7G samples of heart ventricle and exocrine gland tissues, when compared with 1G controls. In the heart, cARP increased in the soluble fraction, while the particulate fraction extract showed no change. In acinar cells of the parotid, labeled cARP had accumulated, but decreased after stimulation to the level of the 1G controls. Immunogold labeling showed an increased content of amylase in the secretory granules of the 1.7G animals, while morphologic observation revealed few changes in the structure of parotid acinar cells. The response in the lachrymal gland was translocation of an isoform of cARP from the particulate to the cytoplasmic compartment.
Changes distinct from those due to 0G, but specific for hyper-G were found in cARP activity, protein synthesis, as well as in an apparent inhibition of regulated secretion.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal']","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2000-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Mednieks', 'firstname': 'M I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral Biology, University of Illinois College of Dentistry, Chicago 60612, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hand', 'firstname': 'A R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Differences were seen in protein banding patterns of the gland extracts and in altered cARP distribution in the 1.7G samples of heart ventricle and exocrine gland tissues, when compared with 1G controls.

147,10776445,"Comparison of hyper- and microgravity on rat muscle, organ weights and selected plasma constituents.","Centrifugation has been proposed to be one possible countermeasure for the skeletal muscle, organ, hormonal, and plasma chemistry adaptations associated with chronic unloading (e.g., during spaceflight).
Our hypothesis was that there would be a continuum of physiological and morphological responses from zero gravity to hypergravity.
Adult male rats were centrifuged continuously at 2G for 14 d and the weights of limb muscles and organs, and the levels of plasma constituents were compared with the same measurements from rats flown on a 14-d spaceflight (Cosmos 2044).
Mean body weights of centrifuge rats did not change, whereas age-matched controls grew 21%. There was a sparing of muscle protein in the centrifuge rats; the absolute weights of predominantly slow muscles in the hindlimb were maintained and the relative weights (expressed relative to body weight and as a percent difference from control) of almost all muscles studied were larger than control. In contrast, spaceflight resulted in a decrease in the relative weights of most extensor, but not flexor, hindlimb muscles studied. Relative organ weights, in general, were elevated in centrifuge rats compared with control rats. Relative organ weights in flight rats were similar to control, except for a decrease in testes weight. Plasma thyroxine and testosterone levels were significantly reduced following flight, whereas only thyroxine was decreased after centrifugation. Centrifugation resulted in a decrease in most other plasma chemistry measurements, whereas flight rats showed no change or an elevation in these measures.
These data indicate that the physiological responses to micro- and hypergravity are often in the opposite direction, suggesting that in general there is a continuum of physiological and morphological effects from microgravity to 1G to hypergravity. These data further suggest that the imposition of hypergravity conditions on animals that are in a microgravity environment may have a beneficial effect in maintaining some physiological systems at or near control levels.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal']","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2000-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Vasques', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Life Sciences Division, NASA-Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lang', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'R R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Daunton', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bigbee', 'firstname': 'A J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wade', 'firstname': 'C E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Mean body weights of centrifuge rats did not change, whereas age-matched controls grew 21%.

148,10749825,Renal vasopressin receptor expression and function in rats following spaceflight.,"It has been suggested there is a decreased renal responsiveness to vasopressin following spaceflight and that this may be the mechanism for the increased urine flow that is observed following return to normal gravity. In the present study, we have therefore measured vasopressin receptor expression and activity in kidneys taken from rats 1 and 14 days following spaceflight of 15 days duration. Measurements of renal vasopressin V(2) and V(1a) receptor mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated little difference at either 1 day or at 14 days following return from space. Evaluation of (3)H-labeled arginine vasopressin binding to membranes prepared from kidneys indicated that the majority of the vasopressin receptors were V(2) receptors. Furthermore, the data suggested that binding to vasopressin V(2) or V(1a) receptors was unaltered at 1 day and 14 days following spaceflight. Similarly, the ability of vasopressin to stimulate adenylate cyclase suggested no change in vasopressin V(2) receptor activity in these animals. These data suggest that, whatever changes in fluid and electrolyte metabolism are observed following spaceflight, they are not mediated by changes in vasopressin receptor number or vasopressin-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Fundamental Space Biology']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2000-04-06,"[{'lastname': 'Brooks', 'firstname': 'D P', 'initials': 'DP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Pharmacology, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406-0939, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nambi', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Laping', 'firstname': 'N J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Olson', 'firstname': 'B A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pullen', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wade', 'firstname': 'C E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.2000.88.4.1316,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc0589a0>
149,10685588,Vasomotor sympathetic nerve activity in men during bed rest and on orthostasis after bed rest.,"Alterations in autonomic function are commonly seen during and after spaceflight, and its ground-based analog, 6 degrees head-down bed rest (HDBR). They may include peripheral vascular regulation, but vasomotor sympathetic efferent nerve discharges to peripheral vasculatures have not been examined. The aim of our study was to examine changes in vasomotor sympathetic nerve activity during HDBR and under orthostasis after HDBR.
We performed 6 d of HDBR on six male subjects, and measured muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) together with plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the supine position before HDBR and in 6 degrees head-down position on the sixth day (HDBR6) of HDBR. We also measured MSNA in head-up tilt (HUT) test before and after HDBR.
On HDBR6, MSNA burst rate was the same (17+/-4 bursts x min(-1)) as that in supine position before HDBR (15+/-2 bursts min(-1)), but plasma norepinephrine concentrations were decreased to 1.14+/-0.10 pmol x ml(-1) compared with the supine value before HDBR (1.56+/-0.20 pmol x ml(-1), p<0.05). After HDBR, supine MSNA burst rate significantly increased by 58% to 24+/-4 bursts x min(-1). MSNA increment in response to HUT was similar between before (34+/-3 bursts min(-1) x sin HUT(-1)) and after (40+/-6 bursts x min(-1) x sin HUT(-1)) HDBR.
Our findings suggest that: a) the relationship between MSNA and plasma norepinephrine concentrations was altered on the sixth day during HDBR; b) the vasomotor sympathetic nerve activity was enhanced after HDBR; and c) the augmentation of vasomotor sympathetic outflow to muscles under orthostasis was preserved after HDBR.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2000-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Kamiya', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Autonomic Neuroscience, Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iwase', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sugiyama', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mano', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sudoh', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"On HDBR6, MSNA burst rate was the same (17+/-4 bursts x min(-1)) as that in supine position before HDBR (15+/-2 bursts min(-1)), but plasma norepinephrine concentrations were decreased to 1.14+/-0.10 pmol x ml(-1) compared with the supine value before HDBR (1.56+/-0.20 pmol x ml(-1), p<0.05).

150,10660774,Hormonal changes in humans during spaceflight.,"Readers of this review may feel that there is much more that we do not know about space endocrinology than what we know. Several reasons for this state of affairs have been given: 1. the complexity of the field of endocrinology with its still increasing number of known hormones, releasing factors and precursors, and of the interactions between them through various feedback mechanisms 2. the difficulty in separating the microgravity effects from the effects of stress from launch, isolation and confinement during flight, reentry, and postflight re-adaptation 3. the experimental limitations during flight, such as limited number of subjects, limited number of samples, impossibility of collecting triple samples for pulsatile hormones like growth hormone 4. the disturbing effects of countermeasures used by astronauts 5. the inadequacy of postflight samples for conclusions about inflight values 6. limitations of conclusions from animal experiments and space simulation studies The endocrinology field is divided in to nine systems or axes, which are successively reviewed: 1. Rapid bone demineralization in the early phase of spaceflight that, when unopposed, leads to catastrophic effects after three months but that slows down later. The endocrine mechanism, apart from the effect of exercise as a countermeasure, is not yet understood. 2. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is involved in stress reactions, which complicate our understanding and makes postflight analysis dubious. 3. In the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, pulsatility poses a problem for obtaining representative values (e.g., for luteinizing hormone). Reproduction of rats in space is possible, but much more needs to be known about this aspect, particularly in women, before the advent of space colonies, but also in males because some evidence for reversible testicular dysfunction in space has been found. 4. The hypothalamic-pituitary-somato-mammotrophic axis involves prolactin and growth hormone. The latter also acts as a stress hormone and its secretion is greatly decreased in spaceflown rats, but not in astronauts, which may be due to differences in the regulation of growth hormone secretion between rats and humans. 5. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis involves the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which are lowered in space, suggesting mild hypothyroidism. 6. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which regulates water and electrolytes, involves antidiuretic hormone and two natriuretic peptides and shows paradoxical behavior in space. 7. Erythrocyte mass regulation involves erythropoietin, and space anemia is still not explained. 8. The endocrine pancreas involves insulin and glucagon, with loss of insulin sensitivity in space due to lack of exercise, which phenomenon requires more study before the advent of space colonies. 9. The sympathetic system acts through epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine and seems to have an increased activity in space in contrast to what had been widely believed. From the foregoing conclusions, it is clear that much further study is needed in all fields of space endocrinology. On the other hand, future studies will allow us to understand what happens in a given endocrine subsystem in the absence of the ""gravity factor"", the perturbing factor to which the human race has become adapted through thousands of years of evolution. This should provide us with a fuller understanding of the internal homeostatic mechanisms. An important point is that some endocrine systems seem to undergo changes in space that resemble those observed during senescence, but after spaceflight, recovery always occurs within weeks or months after return. This is particularly true for the systems regulating bone and muscle metabolism and reproduction, exactly as happens with the immune, neurosensory, and cardiovascular systems.

151,10660772,Is skeletal muscle ready for long-term spaceflight and return to gravity?,"It is now clear that prevention of muscle debilitation during spaceflight will require a broader approach than simple exercise aimed at strengthening of the muscle fibers. The levels of several hormones and receptors are altered by unloading and must be returned to homeostasis. Pharmacotherapy and gene transfer strategies to raise the relative level of structural proteins may minimize the problems faced by astronauts in readapting to Earth-gravity. Up to now, we have only minimally exploited microgravity for advancing our understanding of muscle biology. A research laboratory in the space station with a centrifuge facility (gravity control) is essential for conducting basic research in this field. Microgravity has proven an excellent tool for noninvasively perturbing the synthesis of muscle proteins in the search for molecular signals and gene regulatory factors influencing differentiation, growth, maintenance and atrophy of muscle. Understanding the relation between blood flow and interstitial edema and between workload and subsequent structural failure are but two important problems that require serious attention. The roles of hormones and growth factors in regulating gene expression and their microgravity-induced altered production are other urgent issues to pursue. These types of studies will yield information that advances basic knowledge of muscle biology and offers insights into countermeasure design. This knowledge is likely to assist rehabilitation of diseased or injured muscles in humans on Earth, especially individuals in the more vulnerable aging population and persons participating in strenuous sports. Will the skeletal muscle system be prepared for the increased exposure to microgravity and the return to gravity loading without injury when space station is operational? The answer depends in large part on continued access to space and funding of ground-based models and flight experiments. The previous two decades of spaceflight research have described the effects of microgravity on multiple systems. The next generation of experiments promises to be even more exciting as we are challenged to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms of microgravity-induced changes.","['NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'NASA Program Fundamental Space Biology', 'Non-NASA Center']",Advances in space biology and medicine,2000-02-08,"[{'lastname': 'Riley', 'firstname': 'D A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cellular Biology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1016/s1569-2574(08)60006-4,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbfb1b80>

153,10575587,The response of bone to unloading.,"Skeletal unloading leads to decreased bone formation and decreased bone mass. Bone resorption is uncoupled from bone formation, contributing to the bone loss. During spaceflight bone is lost principally from the bones most loaded in the 1-g environment, and some redistribution of bone from the lower extremities to the head appears to take place. Although changes in calcitropic hormones have been demonstrated during skeletal unloading (PTH and 1,25(OH)2D decrease), it remains unclear whether such changes account for or are in response to the changes in bone formation and resorption. Bed rest studies with human volunteers and hindlimb elevation studies with rats have provided useful data to help explain the changes in bone formation during spaceflight. These models of skeletal unloading reproduce a number of the conditions associated with microgravity, and the findings from such studies confirm many of the observations made during spaceflight. Determining the mechanism(s) by which loading of bone is sensed and translated into a signal(s) controlling bone formation remains the holy grail in this field. Such investigations couple biophysics to biochemistry to cell and molecular biology. Although studies with cell cultures have revealed biochemical responses to mechanical loads comparable to that seen in intact bone, it seems likely that matrix-cell interactions underlie much of the mechanocoupling. The role for systemic hormones such as PTH, GH, and 1,25(OH)2D compared to locally produced factors such as IGF-I, PTHrP, BMPs, and TGF-beta in modulating the cellular response to load remains unclear. As the mechanism(s) by which bone responds to mechanical load with increased bone formation are further elucidated, applications of this knowledge to other etiologies of osteoporosis are likely to develop. Skeletal unloading provides a perturbation in bone mineral homeostasis that can be used to understand the mechanisms by which bone mineral homeostasis is maintained, with the expectation that such understanding will lead to effective treatment for disuse osteoporosis.","['NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'NASA Program Fundamental Space Biology', 'Non-NASA Center']",Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,1999-11-27,"[{'lastname': 'Bikle', 'firstname': 'D D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'University of California, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Endocrine Unit 94121, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Halloran', 'firstname': 'B P', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s007740050090,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbfbe3b0>

The AOH study gave further evidence of transforming glycemic curves. Moreover, increased sizes of tail and head of the pancreas and a decrease in its echogeneity were observed in all test-subjects. Structural changes in the pancreas were confirmed by biochemical investigations which revealed increased levels of blood enzymes and activation of insulin secretion. Increases in the liver size, thickness of the wall of the stomach, diameter of the splenic vein were indicative of progressing venous plethora in the portal vein system. It was shown that venous plethora are the main cause for changes in the upper GI, and in the pancreas state in particular, which can be qualified as dysfunctional.

Water-electrolyte turnover in blood and urine and hormonal controls have been under study.

During the early phase of adaptation to the immersion models, some ostensibly similar responses were governed by different hormonal controls. Unlike the dry immersion, the suited immersion tests with various body positioning modified not only the strength but the dynamics of the water-electrolyte regulation, too.

156,10519483,Biochemical characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors in rats after an 18-day spaceflight (LMS-STS78).,"To ascertain whether there was autonomic adaptation with the development of adrenoceptor hypersensitivity under microgravity, the biochemical properties of the beta-adrenoceptors were determined using (125I)iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding in rats flown for 18 d onboard the space shuttle.
This study was performed on heart and kidneys of 3 groups of 12 animals: the flight and 2 ground control (vivarium and AEM) groups. To distinguish the possible role of the corticosteroids, half of each animal group was bilaterally adrenalectomized (ADX rats) with an aldosterone and corticosterone supplementation while the other half was SHAM operated.
The Scatchard analysis of the ICYP-binding in both organs revealed no significant alterations in the dissociation constant (Kd) and in the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) between SHAM flight and control groups. The Kd of the beta-adrenoceptors in the cardiac atria of the SHAM flight rats (74 +/- 5 pm) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in those of the ADX flight rats (60 +/- 3 pm) while the Bmax was nonsignificantly higher (1925 +/- 370 in SHAM flight rats vs. 1482 +/- 283 fmol x mg(-1) protein in ADX flight rats). No significant change was determined for the Bmax and Kd values in the kidneys of the ADX and SHAM flight rats.
This work performed on animals did not show any obvious effect of microgravity on the beta-adrenergic function in the heart and kidneys.

4245119",Simulated weightlessness-induced attenuation of testosterone production may be responsible for bone loss.,"This study examined the effects of simulated weightlessness on serum hormone levels and their relationship to bone mineral density (BMD). The tail-suspended (i.e., hindlimb suspended, HLS) rat model was used to simulate weightless conditions through hindlimb unloading to assess changes in hormonal profile and the associated bone loss. In the first study, 24 adult male rats were assigned to two groups with 12 rats being HLS for 12 d, and the remaining 12 rats serving as ground controls. On d 0, 6, and 12, blood samples were taken to estimate circulating hormone levels. HLS rats had significant reductions in testosterone, 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D, and thyroxine levels by d 6 (p<0.01); their testosterone levels were almost undetectable by d 12 (p<0.001). Serum cortisol levels in these rats were elevated on d 6 (p<0.02), but returned to normal levels by d 12. No changes were observed with serum ionized calcium and other hormones examined, as well as the body weights, and weights of thymus, heart, and brain. In the second study, eight rats were ground controls, while an additional eight rats were HLS for 12 d before being removed from tail-suspension and maintained for a further 30 d. Blood samples were collected every 6th d for 42 d. This study showed that both serum thyroxine and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D levels returned to normal levels soon after hind limb unweighting, while serum testosterone levels matched normal levels only after a further 3-4 wk. These studies showed a significant decrease of femur weights, but not weights of humeri in HLS rats suggesting that this is a specific effect on unloaded bones. On d 12 in both studies, a significant reduction in the lumbar spine (p<0.05) and the femoral neck (p<0.01) BMD appeared in HLS rats. This was confirmed in the second study, where HLS led to a significant decrease in BMD even extending to d 42. Previous studies have shown that space flight and tail-suspension lead to marked reductions in bone formation with little effect on bone resorption. Recently, we reported that androgen replacement can indeed prevent bone losses in this animal model. Therefore, it seems logical to propose that the significant decreases of serum testosterone observed in these tail-suspended animals are, at least in part, responsible for the losses of BMD seen in their affected weight-bearing bones (i.e., lumbar spine and the femur). Considering that 1. testosterone is anabolic to osteoblasts and also decreases the rate of bone turnover 2. serum testosterone levels are markedly suppressed in simulated weightlessness, and 3. testosterone replacement therapy prevented the bone loss in HLS rats, we propose that the testosterone deficiency in this animal model is related to their bone loss.",[],Endocrine,1999-09-14,"[{'lastname': 'Wimalawansa', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-1065, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wimalawansa', 'firstname': 'S J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/BF02738624,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbfe04a0>
158,10368375,Effects of spaceflight and PEG-IL-2 on rat physiological and immunological responses.,"Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to two 8-day spaceflights on the space shuttle. Rats housed in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's animal enclosure were injected (iv or sc) with pegylated interleukin-2 (PEG-IL-2) or a placebo. We tested the hypothesis that PEG-IL-2 would ameliorate some of the effects of spaceflight. We measured body and organ weights; blood cell differentials; plasma corticosterone; colony-forming units (macrophage and granulocyte macrophage); lymphocyte mitogenic, superantigenic, and interferon-gamma responses; bone marrow cell and peritoneal macrophage cytokine secretion; and bone strength and mass. Few immunological parameters were affected by spaceflight. However, some spaceflight effects were observed in each flight. Specifically, peritoneal macrophage spontaneous secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha occurred in the first but not in the second flight. A significant monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia were detected in the second but not in the first flight. The second mission produced bone changes more consistent with past spaceflight investigations. PEG-IL-2 did not appear to be beneficial; however, this was mostly due to the lack of spaceflight effects. These studies reflect the difficulty in reproducing experimental models by using current space shuttle conditions.","['NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Experiment Number CPIMM01', 'NASA Experiment Number CPIMM02', 'Non-NASA Center']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1999-06-16,"[{'lastname': 'Chapes', 'firstname': 'S K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506, USA. skcbiol@ksu.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Simske', 'firstname': 'S J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sonnenfeld', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'E S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zimmerman', 'firstname': 'R J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1999.86.6.2065,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbf32db0>

This study investigated the effects of short-term spaceflight (8-15 days) on circulating leukocyte subsets, stress hormones, immunoglobulin levels, and neutrophil function. At landing, a 1.5-fold increase in neutrophils was observed compared with preflight values; lymphocytes were slightly decreased, whereas the results were variable for monocytes. No significant changes were observed in plasma levels of immunoglobulins, cortisol, or adrenocorticotropic hormone. In contrast, urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol were significantly elevated at landing. Band neutrophils were observed in 9 of 16 astronauts. Neutrophil chemotactic assays showed a 10-fold decrease in the optimal dose response after landing. Neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells was increased both before and after spaceflight. At landing, the expression of MAC-1 was significantly decreased while L-selectin was significantly increased. These functional alterations may be of clinical significance on long-duration space missions.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']",Journal of leukocyte biology,1999-03-24,"[{'lastname': 'Stowe', 'firstname': 'R P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sams', 'firstname': 'C F', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'S K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Feeback', 'firstname': 'D L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pierson', 'firstname': 'D L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1002/jlb.65.2.179,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbf42a90>

Compared to single and in contrast to single and repeated exposures to the Coriolis accelerations, a repeated 2 g influence produced some structural changes in somatotropic cells of the pituitary and thyroid parenchyma of the thyroid. These changes were indicative of a significant intensification of synthesis and secretion of somatotropic and thyroid hormones.

The contribution of the activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) related to the response of the central serotonin system was evaluated in adrenalectomized with chronic corticosterone replacement rats (flight-ADX+CORT group). These two groups of rats were compared to their respective ground-based controls. Physiological parameters (body, adrenal and thymus weights) and corticosterone levels were measured. In flight-SHAM group as compared to controls, adrenal hypertrophy and elevation in plasma corticosterone levels (174%) were observed, without change in thymus mass. In most brain areas studied, significant decreases in TRP, 5-HTP and 5-HIAA were found associated with lower levels of 5-HT in cortex, thalamus and striatum. Conversely, there were elevations in TRP, 5-HTP levels in striatum and increases in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios, an index of 5-HT turnover, in cortex, striatum and olfactory bulb while the hypothalamus was the sole region where a fall was observed. In ADX rats with chronic corticosterone replacement these effects were not observed in the majority of brain areas. It is concluded that a 17-day spaceflight exerted an inhibitory effect on serotonin metabolism, probably by activation of the HPA axis.

164,9819159,Hormonal changes during a 20-week confinement.,"When the European Space Agency planned the EUROMIR'95 long-duration flight with a European astronaut on board the Russian orbital MIR station, it organized simultaneously a ground simulation, called the Human Behaviour Study, of this manned space mission. The ground simulation was a confinement experiment, and this paper describes the changes in volume-regulating hormones that occurred during and after 20 weeks of confinement.
In a normobaric diving chamber, 3 subjects were confined for 135 d. Arterial pressure, plasma concentrations of blood volume-regulating hormones (active renin and arginine-vasopressin), and urinary variables (aldosterone, arginine-vasopressin, and metabolites of catecholamines) were measured before, during, and after confinement.

Data of the experiment displayed different types of reaction of the volume controls to LBNP at the onset (F-3), in the course of and soon after recovery (R-4) from the extended mission which are signs of specific phases of adaptive shifts in the organism of cosmonaut. Exaggerated reactivity of the hormonal systems during LBNP in flight suggests more significant consequences of the test for the cardiovascular system of human in microgravity. The most expressed hormonal reaction to LBNP was documented at the very beginning of the postflight period.

166,9715967,Indirect evidence of CNS adrenergic pathways activation during spaceflight.,"Microgravity causes cephalad fluid shift and compensatory mechanisms. Hormonal changes suggestive of peripheral sympathetic (catecholaminergic) nervous system activation have been recently found in astronauts during flight. Simulation studies showed increased perivascular sympathetic fiber density in the rat brain.
Intracranial microcirculatory adaptations might also occur in astronauts, involving an increase in the turnover rate of catecholamines, i.e., norepinephrine (NE) and its precursor, Dopamine (DA). DA is known to inhibit prolactin (PRL) release and to enhance growth hormone (GH) secretion by the pituitary. Therefore, increased brain dopaminergic activity would result into lower circulating PRL concentrations. At the same time, plasma levels of GH and of its effector insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) would increase during flight.
Circulating cortisol (CS), PRL, GH and IGF-1 levels were measured 2 d preflight, inflight (4-5 d after launch) and on different days postflight in four astronauts involved in the Spacelab D-2 mission.
No significant changes were found in CS concentrations. PRL decreased while GH and IGF-1 increased inflight (p < 0.05). After flight no statistically relevant hormonal changes were found with respect to preflight.
The observed hormonal changes were consistent with the original hypothesis that spaceflight might activate CNS adrenergic pathways. They occurred in the absence of two typical markers of stress, namely CS and PRL increase, thus ruling out any non-specific effect of acute stress on the results. In agreement with the most recent results of real and simulated microgravity studies performed in both the experimental animal and in man, these data lend support to the hypothesis that the CNS adrenergic pathways are also activated in the human during spaceflight.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1998-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Strollo', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Italian National Research Centers on Ageing, Endocrine Unit, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Norsk', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roecker', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Strollo', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morè', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bollanti', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Riondino', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Scano', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,"The observed hormonal changes were consistent with the original hypothesis that spaceflight might activate CNS adrenergic pathways.

168,9655787,Lack of effect of spaceflight on bone mass and bone formation in group-housed rats.,"As part of an experiment to study the role of corticosteroids in bone changes during spaceflight, male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 wk old, 165 g body weight) were placed in orbit for 17 days, in groups of six, in animal-enclosure modules (AEMs) aboard the space shuttle Columbia (STS-78). Control rats were group housed in a similar manner in ground-based AEMs or standard vivarium cages. Adrenal hypertrophy occurred in flight rats, but bone histomorphometric analyses revealed a lack of significant changes in bone mass and bone formation in these animals. Cancellous bone volume and osteoblast surface in the proximal tibial metaphysis were nearly the same in flight and ground-based rats. Normal levels of cancellous bone mass and bone formation were also detected in the lumbar vertebrae and femoral necks of flight rats. In the tibial diaphysis, periosteal bone formation rate was found to be identical in flight and ground-based rats. The results indicate that, under conditions of group housing in AEMs, spaceflight has minimal effects on bone mass and bone formation in rapidly growing rats. These findings emphasize the need to investigate the importance of rat age, strain, and especially housing conditions for studies of the skeletal effects of spaceflight.","['NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'NASA Experiment Number 284071', 'Non-NASA Center']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1998-07-09,"[{'lastname': 'Wronski', 'firstname': 'T J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'S C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bowman', 'firstname': 'B M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kostenuik', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Halloran', 'firstname': 'B P', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1998.85.1.279,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbed3090>
169,9615283,Sleep and circadian rhythms in four orbiting astronauts.,"This experiment measured the sleep and circadian rhythms of four male astronauts aboard a space shuttle (STS-78) orbiting the Earth for 17 days. The space mission was specially scheduled to minimize disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep so that the effects of space flight and microgravity per se could be studied. Data were collected in 72-h measurement blocks: one block 7 days before launch, one early within the mission (3 days after launch), one late in the mission (12 days after launch), and one 18 days after landing. Within each measurement block, all sleep was recorded both polysomnographically and by sleep diary. Core body temperature was sampled every 6 mins. Actillumes were worn continuously. All urine samples were collected separately. Performance was assessed by a computerized test battery (3/day) and by end-of-shift questionnaires (1/day); mood and alertness were measured by visual analogue scales (5/day). Circadian rhythms in orbit appeared to be very similar in phase and amplitude to those on the ground, and were appropriately aligned for the required work/rest schedule. There was no change from early flight to late flight. This was also reflected in mood, alertness, and performance scores, which were satisfactory at both in-flight time points. However, in-flight sleep showed a decreased amount of sleep obtained (mean = 6.1 h), and all four astronauts showed a decrease in delta sleep. No further degradation in sleep was seen when early flight was compared to late flight, and no other sleep parameters showed reliable trends.","['NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']",Journal of biological rhythms,1998-06-06,"[{'lastname': 'Monk', 'firstname': 'T H', 'initials': 'TH', 'affiliation': 'Sleep and Chronobiology Center, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15213, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Buysse', 'firstname': 'D J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Billy', 'firstname': 'B D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kennedy', 'firstname': 'K S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Willrich', 'firstname': 'L M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1177/074873098129000039,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbedc450>
170,9600759,Hindlimb unloading of growing rats: a model for predicting skeletal changes during space flight.,"A model that uses hindlimb unloading of rats was developed to study the consequences of skeletal unloading and reloading as occurs during and following space flight. Studies using the model were initiated two decades ago and further developed at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Ames Research Center. The model mimics some aspects of exposure to microgravity by removing weightbearing loads from the hindquarters and producing a cephalic fluid shift. Unlike space flight, the forelimbs remain loaded in the model, providing a useful internal control to distinguish between the local and systemic effects of hindlimb unloading. Rats that are hindlimb unloaded by tail traction gain weight at the same rate as pairfed controls, and glucocorticoid levels are not different from controls, suggesting that systemic stress is minimal. Unloaded bones display reductions in cancellous osteoblast number, cancellous mineral apposition rate, trabecular bone volume, cortical periosteal mineralization rate, total bone mass, calcium content, and maturation of bone mineral relative to controls. Subsequent studies reveal that these changes also occur in rats exposed to space flight. In hindlimb unloaded rats, bone formation rates and masses of unloaded bones decline relative to controls, while loaded bones do not change despite a transient reduction in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) concentrations. Studies using the model to evaluate potential countermeasures show that 1,25D, growth hormone, dietary calcium, alendronate, and muscle stimulation modify, but do not completely correct, the suppression of bone growth caused by unloading, whereas continuous infusion of transforming growth factor-beta2 or insulin-like growth factor-1 appears to protect against some of the bone changes caused by unloading. These results emphasize the importance of local as opposed to systemic factors in the skeletal response to unloading, and reveal the pivotal role that osteoblasts play in the response to gravitational loading. The hindlimb unloading model provides a unique opportunity to evaluate in detail the physiological and cellular mechanisms of the skeletal response to weightbearing loads, and has proven to be an effective model for space flight.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'Non-NASA Center']",Bone,1998-05-26,"[{'lastname': 'Morey-Holton', 'firstname': 'E R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Life Sciences Division, NASA-Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000, USA. eholton@mail.arc.nasa.gov'}, {'lastname': 'Globus', 'firstname': 'R K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s8756-3282(98)00019-2,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe66e50>
171,9591619,Pro-opiomelanocortin activation and simulated interceptor combat flight.,"To investigate the influence that psychological workload, associated with simulated combat military flight, has on secretion of stress hormones we measured concentrations of plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) related adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), beta-endorphin (BE), and cortisol in 10 Finnish Air Force (FAF) military interceptor pilots. They performed the same 20-min combat flight mission in a Saab J35 Draken S simulator, including four radar attacks during one-on-one situations with increasing cognitive tasks and psychological strain. Blood samples were collected -35 min, 1 min, 30 min and 60 min after the flight mission. Control blood samples were collected from the subjects at the same time of day in randomized order before or after the flight mission. During the control period the subjects were allowed to perform ground duties.
Plasma CRH was undetectable in samples drawn before or after the flight and control period. Plasma ACTH was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated before the simulated combat flight when compared with the respective value in the control experiment. This is an anticipatory type of stress reaction. Plasma BE did not change significantly after the simulated flight. Plasma cortisol increased significantly (p < 0.05) 1 min after the simulated flight. One of the ten pilots had an extreme POMC and cortisol activation after the flight mission, suggesting that the pilot's stress tolerance was less than average.

Contrary to the expected instead of rising serum myoglobins dropped precipitously during 45 min missions. EKGs revealed marked ischemic and arrhythmia changes.

173,9491251,The effect of microgravity on testicular androgen secretion.,"Spaceflight causes a number of physiological changes in the human body. Most would consider space travel to be a stressful event even for well-trained astronauts. Should this be true, pituitary gonadotrophins (mainly LH) and testicular androgens, like testosterone (T), should decrease inflight in male astronauts. We therefore hypothesized that lowered testicular androgen levels might occur in men during spaceflight, due to stress-dependent lowered LH concentrations.
In order to test this hypothesis, on different day pre-, in- and postflight we assayed wake-time salivary and urinary T in four astronauts, as well as wake-time plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol (CS), LH, T and its peripherally active metabolite 3-alpha-diol glucuronide (3ADG). In order to compare clinical to subjective data, all 7 male crewmembers anonymously answered a daily questionnaire from pre- to postflight asking them to self-rate sexual drive and potency, muscle strength and mood.
Salivary, urinary and plasma T, as well as 3ADG, decreased during flight, while LH unexpectedly increased inflight (p < 0.05). A parallel decrease in sexual drive was observed (p < 0.05). A dramatic recovery of salivary T was found on R + 1.
This was the first time that spaceflight was demonstrated to cause temporary, still dramatic hypoandrogenism which was not due to blunted pituitary gonadotrophin secretion.

We hypothesized that a lunar gravity simulation in the middle of a head-down tilt (HDT) might result in some reversal of body fluid/hormonal responses, and influence cardiovascular deconditioning.
Six men (28 +/- 2.5 yr) were placed in bed rest (BR): in (HDT) (-6 degrees) to simulate microgravity during the travel (two 4-d periods), and in head-up tilt (HUT) (+10 degrees) (6-d period) to simulate lunar gravity (1/6 g). Muscular exercise was performed during the HUT period to simulate 6 h of lunar EVA. Heart rate variability (HRV) and hormonal responses were studied.

A decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide (26 +/- 3.5 pg.ml-1 (D14) vs. 37.9 +/- 3.5 pg.ml-1 (D-3, sitting) and an increase in plasma renin activity (198 +/- 9.2 mg.L-1.min-1 (D14) vs. 71 +/- 9.2 mg.L-1.min-1 (D-3, sitting) were observed during the BR, more pronounced in HUT at 7:00 p.m. Sympathetic-parasympathetic balance (HRV) at rest showed a decrease in parasympathetic indicator and an increase in sympathetic indicator in BR (p < 0.05), without differences within HDT and HUT periods.

178,9075717,The effects of orbital spaceflight on bone histomorphometry and messenger ribonucleic acid levels for bone matrix proteins and skeletal signaling peptides in ovariectomized growing rats.,"A 14-day orbital spaceflight was performed using ovariectomized Fisher 344 rats to determine the combined effects of estrogen deficiency and near weightlessness on tibia radial bone growth and cancellous bone turnover. Twelve ovariectomized rats with established cancellous osteopenia were flown aboard the space shuttle Columbia (STS-62). Thirty ovariectomized rats were housed on earth as ground controls: 12 in animal enclosure modules, 12 in vivarium cages, and 6 killed the day of launch for baseline measurements. An additional 18 ovary-intact rats were housed in vivarium cages as ground controls: 8 rats were killed as baseline controls and the remaining 10 rats were killed 14 days later. Ovariectomy increased periosteal bone formation at the tibia-fibula synostosis; cancellous bone resorption and formation in the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibial metaphysis; and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for the prepro-alpha2(1) subunit of type 1 collagen, osteocalcin, transforming growth factor-beta, and insulin-like growth factor I in the contralateral proximal tibial metaphysis and for the collagen subunit in periosteum pooled from tibiae and femora and decreased cancellous bone area. Compared to ovariectomized weight-bearing rats, the flight group experienced decreases in periosteal bone formation, collagen subunit mRNA levels, and cancellous bone area. The flight rats had a small decrease in the cancellous mineral apposition rate, but no change in the calculated bone formation rate. Also, spaceflight had no effect on cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters or on mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins and signaling peptides. On the other hand, spaceflight resulted in an increase in bone resorption, as ascertained from the diminished retention of a preflight fluorochrome label. This latter finding suggests that osteoclast activity was increased. In a follow-up ground-based experiment, unilateral sciatic neurotomy of ovariectomized rats resulted in cancellous bone loss in the unloaded limb in excess of that induced by gonadal hormone deficiency. This additional bone loss was arrested by estrogen replacement. We conclude from these studies that estrogen alters the expression of signaling peptides believed to mediate skeletal adaptation to changes in mechanical usage and likewise modifies the skeletal response to mechanical unloading.","['NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 18-10', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures', 'Non-NASA Center']",Endocrinology,1997-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cavolina', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'G L', 'initials': 'GL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'S A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Westerlind', 'firstname': 'K C', 'initials': 'KC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Turner', 'firstname': 'R T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1210/endo.138.4.5040,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe2d5e0>
179,11540416,Space flight and the skeleton: lessons for the earthbound.,"Loss of bone during extended space flight has long been a concern that could limit the ability of humans to explore the universe. Surprisingly, the available data do not support the concept that weightlessness leads inexorably to a depleted skeleton unable to withstand the stress of a return to a 1-g environment. Nevertheless, some bone loss does occur, especially in those bones most stressed by gravity prior to flight, which provides confirmation of the proposal formulated over a century ago by Julius Wolff that mechanical stress determines the form and function of bone. Although the phenomenon of bone loss with skeletal unloading, whether by space flight or immobilization or just taking a load off your feet (literally) is well established, the mechanisms by which bone senses load and adjusts to it are not so clear. What actually is the stimulus, and what are the sensors? What are the target cells? How do the sensors communicate the message into the cells, and by what pathways do the cells respond? What is the role of endocrine, factors vs. paracrine or autocrine factors in mediating or modulating the response? None of these questions has been answered with certainty, but, as will become apparent in this review, we have some clues directing us to the answers. Although the focus of this review concerns space flight, it seems highly likely that the mechanisms mediating the transmission of mechanical load to changes in bone formation and resorption apply equally well to all forms of disuse osteoporosis and are likely to be the same mechanisms affected by other etiologies of osteoporosis.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'Non-NASA Center']",The Endocrinologist,1997-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bikle', 'firstname': 'D D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine Unit, University of California, San Francisco, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Halloran', 'firstname': 'B P', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morey-Holton', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/00019616-199707010-00003,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe36e50>
180,9048137,Regulation of body fluid volume and electrolyte concentrations in spaceflight.,"Despite a number of difficulties in performing experiments during weightlessness, a great deal of information has been obtained concerning the effects of spaceflight on the regulation of body fluid and electrolytes. Many paradoxes and questions remain, however. Although body mass, extracellular fluid volume, and plasma volume are reduced during spaceflight and remain so at landing, the changes in total body water are comparatively small. Serum or plasma sodium and osmolality have generally been unchanged or reduced during the spaceflight, and fluid intake is substantially reduced, especially during the first of flight. The diuresis that was predicted to be caused by weightlessness, has only rarely been observed as an increased urine volume. What has been well established by now, is the occurrence of a relative diuresis, where fluid intake decreases more than urine volume does. Urinary excretion of electrolytes has been variable during spaceflight, but retention of fluid and electrolytes at landing has been consistently observed. The glomerular filtration rate was significantly elevated during the SLS missions, and water and electrolyte loading tests have indicated that renal function is altered during readaptation to Earth's gravity. Endocrine control of fluid volumes and electrolyte concentrations may be altered during weightlessness, but levels of hormones in body fluids do not conform to predictions based on early hypotheses. Antidiuretic hormone is not suppressed, though its level is highly variable and its secretion may be affected by space motion sickness and environmental factors. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone are generally elevated at landing, consistent with sodium retention, but inflight levels have been variable. Salt intake may be an important factor influencing the levels of these hormones. The circadian rhythm of cortisol has undoubtedly contributed to its variability, and little is known yet about the influence of spaceflight on circadian rhythms. Atrial natriuretic peptide does not seem to play an important role in the control of natriuresis during spaceflight. Inflight activity of the sympathetic nervous system, assessed by measuring catecholamines and their metabolites and precursors in body fluids, generally seems to be no greater than on Earth, but this system is usually activated at landing. Collaborative experiments on the Mir and the International Space Station should provide more of the data needed from long-term flights, and perhaps help to resolve some of the discrepancies between U.S. and Russian data. The use of alternative methods that are easier to execute during spaceflight, such as collection of saliva instead of blood and urine, should permit more thorough study of circadian rhythms and rapid hormone changes in weightlessness. More investigations of dietary intake of fluid and electrolytes must be performed to understand regulatory processes. Additional hormones that may participate in these processes, such as other natriuretic hormones, should be determined during and after spaceflight. Alterations in body fluid volume and blood electrolyte concentrations during spaceflight have important consequences for readaptation to the 1-G environment. The current assessment of fluid and electrolyte status during weightlessness and at landing and our still incomplete understanding of the processes of adaptation to weightlessness and readaptation to Earth's gravity have resulted in the development of countermeasures that are only partly successful in reducing the postflight orthostatic intolerance experienced by astronauts and cosmonauts. More complete knowledge of these processes can be expected to produce countermeasures that are even more successful, as well as expand our comprehension of the range of adaptability of human physiologic processes.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 18-10', 'NASA Discipline Number 70-10', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Data Analysis', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures']",Advances in space biology and medicine,1997-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'NASA/Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Krauhs', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s1569-2574(08)60081-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe41450>
181,12703534,Effects of space flight on endocrine system function in experimental animals.,"The effects exposing rats to space flights of various lengths in a series of COSMOS satellites are reported based on an evaluation of plasma hormone levels and several enzyme activities in the tissues. The results after space flights are compared with those obtained from rats exposed to acute or repeated stress. Space flight induced selective morphological responses in the corticotrophs and gonadotrophs of the pituitary. Plasma levels of ACTH did not change, but plasma growth hormone and TSH levels decreased after longer space flights (>14 days), while prolactin in the plasma increased after short flights (5-7 days). Plasma corticosterone was higher after all flights. Catecholamine levels in plasma increased only after long space flights. These changes in plasma hormone levels affected the activities of enzymes involved in the amino acid metabolism of the liver and lipolysis in the adipose tissues. Norepinephrine level and catecholamine synthesizing enzyme activity in the hypothalamus did not change in flight rats. The norepinephrine content, however, decreased in several nuclei selected from the hypothalamus of flight rats. Increases in plasma insulin and glucose were noted in rats after space flight. Glucagone values in plasma remained unchanged. Comparing these results from flight rats against rats exposed to acute or repeated stress indicate that long stays in microgravity do not represent intensive stressogenic stimulus of the adrenocortical and sympathetic adrenomedullar systems, and hormone alterations observed after space flight may be due primarily to acute stressor activity resulting from a return to Earth's gravity (gravitational stress).",[],"Environmental medicine : annual report of the Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University",1996-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Macho', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Space Medicine Research Center, Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kvetnansky', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nemeth', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fickova', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Popova', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Serova', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grigoriev', 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe494f0>

6358784",Calbindins decreased after space flight.,"Exposure of the body to microgravity during space flight causes a series of well-documented changes in Ca2+ metabolism, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to these changes are poorly understood. Calbindins, vitamin D-dependent Ca2+ binding proteins, are believed to have a significant role in maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. In this study, we used biochemical and immunocytochemical approaches to analyze the expression of calbindin-D28k and calbindin-D9k in kidneys, small intestine, and pancreas of rats flown for 9 d aboard the space shuttle. The effects of microgravity on calbindins in rats from space were compared with synchronous Animal Enclosure Module controls, modeled weightlessness animals (tail suspension), and their controls. Exposure to microgravity resulted in a significant and sustained decrease in calbindin-D28k content in the kidney and calbindin-D9k in the small intestine of flight animals, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Modeled weightlessness animals exhibited a similar decrease in calbindins by ELISA. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) in combination with quantitative computer image analysis was used to measure in situ the expression of calbindins in the kidney and the small intestine, and the expression of insulin in pancreas. There was a large decrease of immunoreactivity in renal distal tubular cell-associated calbindin-D28k and in intestinal absorptive cell-associated calbindin-D9k of space flight and modeled weightlessness animals compared with matched controls. No consistent difference in pancreatic insulin immunoreactivity between space flight, modeled weightlessness, and controls was observed. Regression analysis of results obtained by quantitative ICC and ELISA for space flight, modeled weightlessness animals, and their controls demonstrated a significant correlation. These findings after a short-term exposure to microgravity or modeled weightlessness suggest that a decreased expression of calbindins may contribute to the disorders of Ca2+ metabolism induced by space flight.","['NASA Discipline Cell Biology', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Program Flight', 'Non-NASA Center']",Endocrine,1996-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sergeev', 'firstname': 'I N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, Cell and Neurobiology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, WV, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rhoten', 'firstname': 'W B', 'initials': 'WB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carney', 'firstname': 'M D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/BF02739068,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe51810>
183,8897402,Role of arginine vasopressin in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume.,"The Henry-Gauer hypothesis postulates that changes in left atrial pressure induce changes in the release of arginine vasopressin (AVP), which subsequently modulates the renal output of fluid. Results of the past decades indicate that this hypothesis is too simplistic in explaining the complexity of extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) regulation in humans. Factors controlling renal sodium excretion are the primary modulators of ECFV. AVP is probably important in the related adjustments of renal water excretion whereby changes in plasma sodium concentration induce changes in plasma osmolality and, subsequently, in release of AVP. Evidence has accrued that changes in arterial variables, e.g., arterial pulse pressure, induce changes in the release of AVP during acute changes in central blood volume. Thus, arterial baroreflex regulation of AVP release might constitute one of several pathways of ECFV regulation. Recent results from the D2-Spacelab mission on ECFV regulation are surprising. Following an isotonic saline infusion, renal sodium and fluid output were lower than expected from results of simulation experiments, and venous plasma NE and renin higher. Since plasma AVP was low, high levels of this variable cannot constitute an explanation for the attenuated renal output of fluid during flight. Thus, the currently used models (in particular head-down bed rest) for simulating microgravity should be critically reevaluated. In addition, the relationship between central cardiovascular variables, endocrine mediators, and renal function during microgravity should be a focus of future research.",[],Medicine and science in sports and exercise,1996-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Norsk', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Danish Aerospace Medical Centre of Research, National University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]",,,,,10.1097/00005768-199610000-00031,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbc23bd0>

The research described here was planned as part of the first joint Russian-U.S. science program carried out during a Shuttle flight. The aim of the program was to study the nature of the changes in fluid homeostasis induced by microgravity, as well as to determine the possible mechanisms underlying the regulation of fluid balance under conditions of spaceflight. To determine the effects of spaceflight on the homeostasis of fluid and electrolytes, measurements were taken of total body water, extracellular fluid plasma volumes, levels of regulatory hormones, and nutrient consumption before, during, and after a nine-day flight. Changes in renal function were studied before and after the flight. In these 2 subjects, weightlessness was not associated with a decreased extracellular fluid volume. However, there were the characteristic decreases in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, and increases in plasma and urinary cortisol. Results indicated decreased urine volume, even through the first 48 hours of flight. Fluid volumes and glomerular filtration rate were increased after landing, probably related to the saline-loading countermeasure used by Shuttle crewmembers. The information obtained as a result of this research will facilitate the development of future research programs, as well as preventive measures for future long-duration spaceflights.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']",Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,1996-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Grigoriev', 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Huntoon', 'firstname': 'C L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morukov', 'firstname': 'B V', 'initials': 'BV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lane', 'firstname': 'H W', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Larina', 'firstname': 'I M', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbc2af90>

186,8871909,Neuroendocrine and immune system responses with spaceflights.,"Despite the fact that the first human was in space during 1961 and individuals have existed in a microgravity environment for more than a year, there are limited spaceflight data available on the responses of the neuroendocrine and immune systems. Because of mutual interactions between these respective integrative systems, it is inappropriate to assume that the responses of one have no impact on functions of the other. Blood and plasma volume consistently decrease with spaceflight; hence, blood endocrine and immune constituents will be modified by both gravitational and measurement influences. The majority of the in-flight data relates to endocrine responses that influence fluids and electrolytes during the first month in space. Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), aldosterone, and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) appear to be elevated with little change in the atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP). Flight results longer than 60 d show increased ADH variability with elevations in angiotensin and cortisol. Although post-flight results are influenced by reentry and recovery events, ACTH and ADH appear to be consistently elevated with variable results being reported for the other hormones. Limited in-flight data on insulin and growth hormone levels suggest they are not elevated to counteract the loss in muscle mass. Post-flight results from short- and long-term flights indicate that thyroxine and insulin are increased while growth hormone exhibits minimal change. In-flight parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are variable for several weeks after which they remain elevated. Post-flight PTH was increased on missions that lasted either 7 or 237 d, whereas calcitonin concentrations were increased after 1 wk but decreased after longer flights. Leukocytes are elevated in flights of various durations because of an increase in neutrophils. The majority of post-flights data indicates immunoglobulin concentrations are not significantly changed from pre-flight measurements. However, the numbers of T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells are decreased with post-flight conditions. Of the lymphokines, interleukin-2 production, lymphocyte responsiveness, and the activity of natural killer cells are consistently reduced post-flight. Limited head-down tilt (HDT) data suggest it is an effective simulation model for microgravity investigations. Neuroendocrine and pharmacological countermeasures are virtually nonexistent and should become high priority items for future research. Although exercise has the potential to be an effective countermeasure for various neuroendocrine-immune responses in microgravity, this concept must be tested before flights to Mars are scheduled.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,1996-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Tipton', 'firstname': 'C M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721-0093, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Greenleaf', 'firstname': 'J E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jackson', 'firstname': 'C G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/00005768-199608000-00009,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbc3ca90>
187,8828652,Regulation of body fluid compartments during short-term spaceflight.,"The fluid and electrolyte regulation experiment with seven subjects was designed to describe body fluid, renal, and fluid regulatory hormone responses during the Spacelab Life Sciences-1 (9 days) and -2 (14 days) missions. Total body water did not change significantly. Plasma volume (PV; P < 0.05) and extracellular fluid volume (ECFV; P < 0.10) decreased 21 h after launch, remaining below preflight levels until after landing. Fluid intake decreased during weightlessness, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased in the first 2 days and on day 8 (P < 0.05). Urinary antidiuretic hormone (ADH) excretion increased (P < 0.05) and fluid excretion decreased early in flight (P < 0.10). Plasma renin activity (PRA; P < 0.10) and aldosterone (P < 0.05) decreased in the first few hours after launch; PRA increased 1 wk later (P < 0.05). During flight, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were consistently lower than preflight means, and urinary cortisol excretion was usually greater than preflight levels. Acceleration at launch and landing probably caused increases in ADH and cortisol excretion, and a shift of fluid from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment would account for reductions in ECFV. Increased permeability of capillary membranes may be the most important mechanism causing spaceflight-induced PV reduction, which is probably maintained by increased GFR and other mechanisms. If the Gauer-Henry reflex operates during spaceflight, it must be completed within the first 21 h of flight and be succeeded by establishment of a reduced PV set point.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 18-10', 'NASA Discipline Number 70-10', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Data Analysis', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1996-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Operations and Research Branch, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alfrey', 'firstname': 'C P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Suki', 'firstname': 'W N', 'initials': 'WN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Leonard', 'firstname': 'J I', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rambaut', 'firstname': 'P C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Inners', 'firstname': 'L D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lane', 'firstname': 'H W', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Krauhs', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1996.81.1.105,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbc42ea0>
188,8828650,Diet and nitrogen metabolism during spaceflight on the shuttle.,"Human spaceflight is associated with a loss of body protein. To investigate this problem, dietary intake, nitrogen balance, the whole body protein, and fibrinogen protein synthesis rates were measured on the crews of two Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS) shuttle missions before, during, and after spaceflight. The first mission, SLS-1, lasted 9.5 days, and the second, SLS-2, lasted 15 days. The 15N-glycine method was used for the protein synthesis measurements. The following results were obtained. 1) There was a rapid decline in weight for the first 5 days and then the body weight appeared to stabilize. 2) The mean energy intake preflight was 39.0 +/- 2.5 kcal x kg-1 x day-1 (n = 10). There was a sharp drop in dietary intake on flight day 1, with recovery by the second day, and then energy intake was constant at 30.4 +/- 1.5 kcal x kg-1 x day-1 (n = 12) for the remainder of the flight period (P < 0.05). 3) Nitrogen retention was decreased during flight, with the magnitude of the decrease lessening toward the end of the mission. The daily mean nitrogen balance changed from 58 +/- 9 mg x kg-1 x day-1 (n = 9) preflight to 16 +/- 3 mg N x kg-1 x day-1; P < 0.05; n = 11) in flight, corresponding to a loss of approximately 1 kg of lean body mass over 14 days. 4) Whole body protein synthesis was increased early in flight and on recovery, as was fibrinogen synthesis. We conclude that 1) the rapid readjustment and stabilization of energy intake and the improved nitrogen retention with increasing flight duration are consistent with a rapid metabolic accommodation to the novel environment; and that 2) the increased protein turnover indicates that a metabolic stress response is an important factor in this adjustment process.","['NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Flight', 'Non-NASA Center']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1996-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'T P', 'initials': 'TP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford 08084, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Leskiw', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schluter', 'firstname': 'M D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1996.81.1.82,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbc50180>
189,8987574,Bioprocessing in microgravity: applications of continuous flow electrophoresis to rat anterior pituitary particles.,"In this report we describe the results of a continuous flow electrophoresis (CFE) experiment done on STS-65 in which we tested the idea that intracellular growth hormone (GH) particles contained in a cell lysate prepared from cultured rat anterior pituitary cells in microgravity might have different electrophoretic mobilities from those in a synchronous ground control cell lysate. Collectively, the results suggested that CFE processing in microgravity was better than on earth; more sample could be processed/time (6 x) and more variant forms of GH molecules could be resolved as well. We had also hoped to carry out a pituitary cell CFE experiment, but failure of the hardware required that the actual cell electrophoresis trials be done on earth shortly after Shuttle landing. Data from these experiments showed that space-flown cells possessed a higher electrophoretic mobility than ground control cells, thereby offering evidence for the idea that exposure of cultured cells to microgravity can change their net surface charge-density especially when the cells are fed.

190,8900984,Trace element and hormonal responses during flight aptitude test.,"The purpose of this study was to determine how trace metal and hormone levels change during stressful flight tests. The relationship between the hormonal response and flying performance was also investigated.
Urinary zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), noradrenaline (NAd), adrenaline (Adr), and saliva cortisol (Cs) levels were determined in 67 pilot applicants and compared with NAd, Adr, and Cs levels in 30 instructor pilots during 4 flight tests.
Applicants had significantly decreased Zn concentrations following flight, but Cu concentrations remained unchanged. NAd, Adr, and Cs concentrations significantly increased following flight; the average ratio (post-/pre-flight) of the hormonal levels of the applicants was 1.52 (NAd), 3.57 (Adr), and 2.80 (Cs) compared with 1.86 (Adr) in instructors (NAd and Cs concentrations were not significantly changed in instructors following flight). Multiple regression analyses of post-flight levels of Zn for the hormonal levels revealed that Zn levels correlated significantly (p < 0.05) negatively with Adr levels. Hormonal responses for the best-rated and worst-rated applicant groups were greater than in the other groups, and post-flight levels of NAd and Adr in the best-rated group tended to return more rapidly to pre-flight levels.

191,8964763,Experimental modification of rat pituitary prolactin cell function during and after spaceflight.,"This study was done to evaluate the effects of microgravity on prolactin (PRL) cells of the male rat pituitary gland. We used the identical passive closed-vial cell culture system that was described for the culture of growth hormone cells (W. C. Hymen, R. E. Grindeland, T. Salada, P. Nye, E. Grossman, and P. Lane. J. Appl. Physiol. 80:955-970, 1996). After an 8-day spaceflight, all flight media (containing released PRL), as well as extracts (containing intracellular PRL), contained significantly lower amounts of immunoreactive PRL than their corresponding ground control samples. On the other hand, these same samples, when assessed for their biological activities by two different in vitro lymphocyte assays, yielded disparate results that may reflect posttranslational modifications to the hormone molecule. Other data showed that 1) the apparent molecular weights of released PRL molecules were not altered by microgravity, but 2) the region from which the PRL cells came (dorsal or ventral) made a significant difference in the amount and activity of PRL released from the flight cells. Because there is much current interest in the role that PRL may play in the regulation of the immune system and because changes in both cellular and humoral immunity accompany spaceflight, this study could help define future microgravity research in this area.","['NASA Discipline Cell Biology', 'NASA Experiment Number DC84LS12', 'Non-NASA Center']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1996-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hymer', 'firstname': 'W C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Salada', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Avery', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1996.80.3.971,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db9aca40>
192,8964762,Experimental modification of rat pituitary growth hormone cell function during and after spaceflight.,"Space-flown rats show a number of flight-induced changes in the structure and function of pituitary growth hormone (GH) cells after in vitro postflight testing (W.

To evaluate the possible effects of microgravity on growth hormone (GH) cells themselves, freshly dispersed rat anterior pituitary gland cells were seeded into vials containing serum +/- microM hydrocortisone (HC) before flight. Five different cell preparations were used: the entire mixed-cell population of various hormone-producing cell types, cells of density < 1.071 g/cm3 (band 1), cells of density > 1.071 g/cm3 (band 2), and cells prepared from either the dorsal or ventral part of the gland. Relative to ground control samples, bioactive GH released from dense cells during flight was reduced in HC-free medium but was increased in HC-containing medium. Band 1 and mixed cells usually showed opposite HC-dependent responses. Release of bioactive GH from ventral flight cells was lower; postflight responses to GH-releasing hormone challenge were reduced, and the cytoplasmic area occupied by GH in the dense cells was greater. Collectively, the data show that the chemistry and cellular makeup of the culture system modifies the response of GH cells to microgravity. As such, these cells offer a system to identify gravisensing mechanisms in secretory cells in future microgravity research.","['NASA Discipline Cell Biology', 'NASA Experiment Number DC84LS12', 'Non-NASA Center']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1996-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hymer', 'firstname': 'W C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Salada', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nye', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grossman', 'firstname': 'E J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lane', 'firstname': 'P K', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1996.80.3.955,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db9b5860>

To this event, we investigated 35 cosmonauts who had made either short- (up to 8 days) or long-term (up to 366 days) space flights.

No evident correlative link between the preflight and postflight concentrations of inorganic serum components was established; however, there was a high correlation of parathormone and cortisol concentrations inferring the participation of these hormones in readaptation. Integral analysis of all the mineral and hormonal parameters of blood serum shapes them into something unique apt to change after flight.

Salivary samples were collected simultaneously. During flight a decrease of diuresis and ANP and an increase of osmolality were found. No modifications of hematocrit, but an increase of salivary cGMP and cortisol were also observed. The decrease of urinary ANP is in favor of hypovolemia as described in previous flights.

196,11541003,Bright light as a chronobiological countermeasure for shiftwork in space.,"Work-rest schedules during long duration space missions involve several factors which could disrupt sleep and circadian temporal organisation: (1) displacement of sleep due to two-shift operations; (2) planned or unplanned schedule changes due to operational requirements; (3) social and light zeitgebers different from those on earth; (4) changes in the gravitational exposure. Timed bright light treatment has the potential to accelerating adaptation to schedule changes. Four male subjects were exposed to two sessions of 11 d of simulated microgravity (6 degrees head down tilt bedrest) with 6-h extensions of the wake period on 2 days (12-h phase delay). In a blind crossover design, subjects were exposed to bright light (>3500 lux) for 5 h on each of the 2 shift days and the following day, at times either expected to accelerate the adjustment to the phase delay (experimental condition) or to have no phase shifting effect (control condition). Sleep was recorded polygraphically, the circadian system was monitored by recordings of heart rate and body temperature, and by collection of urine (electrolyte and hormone excretion). Only the rhythms of 6-hydroxymelatoninsulphate and potassium excretions showed significantly enhanced adjustment under the experimental condition. Different rhythms adapted to the 12-h delay at different rates, comparable to those observed after time zone shifts. Sleep was shorter in simulated weightlessness than in normal ambulatory age-matched subjects, consistent with the shorter sleep durations characteristic of space flight. These results confirm the disruptive effects of wake-rest schedule shifts on sleep and circadian rhythms. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, 5-h exposures to bright light finishing at the time of the circadian temperature minimum were not more effective at accelerating adjustment to a 12-h schedule delay than exposures coinciding with the temperature maximum. We conclude that, while bright light may accelerate adjustment to work-rest schedule delays, any such effect seems to be largely independent from the timing of the light exposure.",[],Acta astronautica,1995-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Samel', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'DLR-Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Koln, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gander', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0094-5765(95)00157-3,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db9d5c20>
197,11540975,"Choroidal responses in microgravity. (SLS-1, SLS-2 and hindlimb-suspension experiments).","Fluid and electrolyte shifts occurring during human spaceflight have been reported and investigated at the level of blood, cardiovascular and renal responses. Very few data were available concerning the cerebral fluid and electrolyte adaptation to microgravity, even in animal models. It is the reason why we developed several studies focused on the effects of spaceflight (SLS-1 and SLS-2 programs, carried on NASA STS 40 and 56 missions, which were 9- and 14-day flights, respectively), on structural and functional features of choroid plexuses, organs which secrete 70-90% of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and which are involved in brain homeostasis. Rats flown aboard space shuttles were sacrificed either in space (SLS-2 experiment, on flight day 13) or 4-8 hours after landing (SLS-1 and SLS-2 experiments). Quantitative autoradiography performed by microdensitometry and image analysis, showed that lateral and third ventricle choroid plexuses from rats flown for SLS-1 experiment demonstrated an increased number (about x 2) of binding sites to natriuretic peptides (which are known to be involved in mechanisms regulating CSF production). Using electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, we studied the cellular response of choroid plexuses, which produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in brain lateral, third and fourth ventricles. We demonstrated that spaceflight (SLS-2 experiment, inflight samples) induces changes in the choroidal cell structure (apical microvilli, kinocilia organization, vesicle accumulation) and protein distribution or expression (carbonic anhydrase II, water channels,...). These observations suggested a loss of choroidal cell polarity and a decrease in CSF secretion. Hindlimb-suspended rats displayed similar choroidal changes. All together, these results support the hypothesis of a modified CSF production in rats during long-term (9, 13 or 14 days) adaptations to microgravity.",[],Acta astronautica,1995-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Gabrion', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite de Montpellier 11.'}, {'lastname': 'Herbute', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Oliver', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maurel', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Davet', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Clavel', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gharib', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fareh', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fagette', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0094-5765(95)00129-8,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db9dedb0>

Supine plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations increased 34 and 65%, respectively, on landing day compared with before flight. Standing on landing day resulted in a 65 and 91% increase in plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine, respectively. Supine and standing norepinephrine levels remained elevated 3 days after landing while epinephrine levels returned to preflight levels. On landing day, supine heart rate and systolic blood pressure increased 18 and 8.9%, respectively, and standing heart rate and diastolic blood pressure were elevated by 38 and 19%, respectively. On standing, stroke volume was decreased by 26% on landing day compared with before flight. Collectively, these data indicate that the decreased orthostatic function after spaceflight results largely from the decreased stroke volume.

199,7720659,The molecular response of bone to growth hormone during skeletal unloading: regional differences.,"Hind limb elevation of the growing rat provides a good model for the skeletal changes that occur during space flight. In this model the bones of the forelimbs (normally loaded) are used as an internal control for the changes that occur in the unloaded bones of the hind limbs. Previous studies have shown that skeletal unloading of the hind limbs results in a transient reduction of bone formation in the tibia and femur, with no change in the humerus. This fall in bone formation is accompanied by a fall in serum osteocalcin (bone Gla protein, BGP) and bone BGP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, but a rise in bone insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) protein and mRNA levels and resistance to the skeletal growth-promoting actions of IGF-I. To determine whether skeletal unloading also induced resistance to GH, we evaluated the response of the femur and humerus of sham and hypophysectomized rats, control and hind limb elevated, to GH (two doses), measuring mRNA levels of IGF-I, BGP, rat bone alkaline phosphatase (RAP), and alpha 1(1)-procollagen (coll). Hypophysectomy (HPX) decreased the mRNA levels of IGF-I, BGP, and coll in the femur, but was either less effective or had the opposite effect in the humerus. GH at the higher dose (500 micrograms/day) restored these mRNA levels to or above the sham control values in the femur, but generally had little or no effect on the humerus. RAP mRNA levels were increased by HPX, especially in the femur. The lower dose of GH (50 micrograms/day) inhibited this rise in RAP, whereas the higher dose raised the mRNA levels and resulted in the appearance of additional transcripts not seen in controls. As for the other mRNAs, RAP mRNA in the humerus was less affected by HPX or GH than that in the femur. Hind limb elevation led to an increase in IGF-I, coll, and RAP mRNAs and a reduction in BGP mRNA in the femur and either had no effect or potentiated the response of these mRNAs to GH. We conclude that GH stimulates a number of markers of bone formation by raising their mRNA levels, and that skeletal unloading does not block this response, but the response varies substantially from bone to bone.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'Non-NASA Center']",Endocrinology,1995-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bikle', 'firstname': 'D D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Halloran', 'firstname': 'B P', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Currier', 'firstname': 'P A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tanner', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morey-Holton', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1210/endo.136.5.7720659,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db973950>

The rate of increase in regenerate size was higher in the flight group than in the control. Enhancement of the proliferative activity of eye tissues, acceleration of lens regeneration, and the larger size of the regenerates are related to hormonal changes arising under the effect of space-flight factors.

All subjects performed the same short-term basic flight mission, which included the following: 1) start; 2) ILS-approach in minimum weather conditions; 3) visual approach; and 4) landing. The mission was performed twice: first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with a BA Hawk MK 51 jet trainer with Gz-forces below +2. Blood samples were collected 30 min before and 10 min after the mission and were measured for adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, beta-endorphin, prolactin, vasopressin (AVP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and cortisol. The plasma levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, beta-endorphin, and cortisol did not change significantly in response to simulated or real flight. Plasma prolactin levels increased significantly (p = 0.037) in all subjects after the mission performed with jet trainer, and the increase was especially great in cadets. However, the same mission performed with the simulator did not raise plasma prolactin levels. This finding suggests that the psychological workload in a flight simulator does not correspond to the psychological workload in a real jet trainer, at least not in basic flying. Plasma AVP increased significantly (p = 0.032) after the mission performed with the simulator in cadets; this increase can be described as a ""first-time effect.""

Following space flight, it has been shown that both humans and animals have significant changes in red blood cell counts (RBC) and white blood cell counts (WBC). In other studies, where no difference occurred in total WBC, a significant change did occur in the distribution of WBC. WBC are affected by circulating levels of glucocorticoids, which often increase when animals or humans are exposed to adverse and/or novel stimuli (e.g. elevated CO2 levels or weightlessness). The purpose of this study was to determine if elevations in CO2 concentration produce changes in total WBC and/or their distribution.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Cardiopulmonary', 'NASA Discipline Number 14-10', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures']",Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,1995-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Alexander', 'firstname': 'R A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Bionetics Corporation, Moffett Field, CA, 94035, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lang', 'firstname': 'C K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Steele', 'firstname': 'M K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Corbin', 'firstname': 'B J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wade', 'firstname': 'C E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db994cc0>

Morphometry revealed the corticotrophs of space-flown rats to be significantly enlarged, demonstrating 46-48% increases in mean cell, nuclear, and cytoplasmic areas. These corticotrophs also exhibited striking ultrastructural signs of heightened secretory activity. Furthermore, their expression of proopiomelanocortin mRNA, the transcript encoding the precursor protein from which adrenocorticotropic hormone is posttranslationally cleaved, was also significantly enhanced, a finding consistent with their hypersecretory state. Gonadotrophs also exhibited significant increments in mean nuclear, cell, and cytoplasmic areas of 22, 45, and 51%, respectively; however, they were not accompanied by ultrastructural evidence of increased secretory function. There were no morphological changes in somatotrophs, lactotrophs, or thyrotrophs, nor were there any significant changes in the overall frequency of any one adenohypophyseal cell type in comparison with control. The structural integrity of all adenohypophyseal secretory and vascular elements was preserved after spaceflight, as there was neither evidence of necrosis nor other forms of cellular injury in spaceflown specimens. Capillaries were patent, and neither endothelial damage nor thrombosis was noted. These data suggest that spaceflight is accompanied by a selective morphological response in the anterior pituitary, one characterized by hypertrophy of both corticotrophs and gonadotrophs and by enhanced endocrine activity of the former.",[],"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1994-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Thapar', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurosurgery, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Kovacs', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Horvath', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stefaneanu', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chambers', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mortimer', 'firstname': 'A J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1994.77.3.1411,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db926270>
206,11541852,Protein crystal growth in microgravity-temperature induced large scale crystallization of insulin.,"One of the major stumbling blocks that prevents rapid structure determination using x-ray crystallography is macromolecular crystal growth. There are many examples where crystallization takes longer than structure determination. In some cases, it is impossible to grow useful crystals on earth. Recent experiments conducted in conjunction with NASA on various Space Shuttle missions have demonstrated that protein crystals often grow larger and display better internal molecular order than their earth-grown counterparts. This paper reports results from three Shuttle flights using the Protein Crystallization Facility (PCF). The PCF hardware produced large, high-quality insulin crystals by using a temperature change as the sole means to affect protein solubility and thus, crystallization. The facility consists of cylinders/containers with volumes of 500, 200, 100, and 50 ml. Data from the three Shuttle flights demonstrated that larger, higher resolution crystals (as evidenced by x-ray diffraction data) were obtained from the microgravity experiments when compared to earth-grown crystals.",[],Microgravity science and technology,1994-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Long', 'firstname': 'M M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Center of Macromolecular Crystallography, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294-0005, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'DeLucas', 'firstname': 'L J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carson', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Harrington', 'firstname': 'M D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pillion', 'firstname': 'D J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bishop', 'firstname': 'S P', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rosenblum', 'firstname': 'W M', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Naumann', 'firstname': 'R J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chait', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Prahl', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bugg', 'firstname': 'C E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db92e360>

Because of the loss of hydrostatic pressure there is, during weightlessness, a fluid shift of extra- and intra-vascular volumes to the upper part of the body. This provokes objective and subjective symptoms, especially in the first days of spaceflight. The fluid shift is perceived by baroreceptors as a relative central hypervolaemia and induces neuro-hormonal mechanisms which provoke a real hypovolaemia. Cardiovascular deconditioning exists during spaceflight with the following symptoms when astronauts return to earth: decreased orthostatic tolerance with possible tendency towards spontaneous syncope and decreased effort capacity. The mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance are not well known.

Therefore several studies were performed to investigate the activity of endocrine system, since the hormones are involved in the regulation of physiological functions and metabolic processes. However the studies of endocrine system activity during altered gravity conditions, especially during the weightlessness are influenced by the several interventions in biomedical observations due to operational program of astronauts, wide variability in individual response and tolerance, use of extensive countermeasures, differences in the type of space missions and in the studies after landing also a hypergravity effect at landing and variability in postflight readaptation process. The significant changes of plasma insulin and glucose levels were observed in astronauts during space flights and in the first days of recovery period. In the first inflight period plasma insulin levels were increased, unchanged or decreased however after 4-5 weeks of exposure to weightlessness a decrease of insulin plasma levels were noted. After space flights an increase of plasma insulin levels were demonstrated in experimental animals and in human subjects. Since plasma insulin level is considered as most important factor involved in the regulation for insulin receptors in target tissues, an investigation of insulin receptors in various tissues was performed in rats exposed to space flight or to hypokinesia (model used for simulation of some effects of microgravity).",[],Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,1994-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Macho', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, SAS, Bratislava, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fickova', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Svabova', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zorad', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Serova', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Popova', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db93e090>

The number of 125I-rANP binding sites (expressed by Bmax values) in the choroid plexus of lateral and third ventricles of these rats was significantly increased (x 1.5-2.5 times), as compared with that found in ground control rats. No differences in the binding affinity (deducible from Kd values) were observed at the level of these structures. The choroid plexus from the fourth ventricle of the same rats displayed no changes in the binding capacity or affinity after the spaceflight. Meningia from the rats flown in space did not demonstrate any significant modifications of the number of 125I-rANP binding sites, but displayed a significant increase in Kd values, which suggested a reduced affinity of the meningeal ANP receptors during a 9-d spaceflight. The possibility that atrial natriuretic peptide may be involved in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte fluxes in the brain, during adaptation to microgravity, through modified expression of specific high affinity receptors, mainly in choroid plexus from forebrain or in meningia, must be considered.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1994-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Herbuté', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'URA CNRS 530, Université de Montpellier II, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Oliver', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Davet', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Viso', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ballard', 'firstname': 'R W', 'initials': 'RW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gharib', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gabrion', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db944f90>

1660260",Water and electrolyte studies during long-term missions onboard the space stations SALYUT and MIR.,"This contribution summarizes the results of investigations of water-electrolyte metabolism and its hormonal regulation conducted in cosmonauts who performed long-term space flights (from 18 to 366 days) aboard the space stations Salyut and Mir and compares them with the results obtained during various NASA flights. The role of the kidneys in ion metabolism regulation was assessed by various water-salt load tests before and after flights. In addition, the results of a year-long space flight and of medical experiments performed during the 237- and 241-day missions by the physicians and cosmonaut-researchers Atkov and Polyakov are reviewed in detail. In spite of interindividual variations, metabolic, and endocrine studies during prolonged space flights showed a reduction in body mass, usually with a reduction in body water and electrolytes and considerable changes in blood hormone concentrations and urinary hormone excretion. These changes reflect the processes of extended adaptation to a new environment. It is likely that shifts in electrolyte metabolism in weightlessness are primarily due to metabolic changes that diminish the tissue ability for ion retention and to concomitant changes in the endocrine status. The postflight examinations revealed changes in fluid-electrolyte metabolism and in the function of the kidneys which indicated a hypohydration status and a stimulation of hormonal systems responsible for fluid-electrolyte homeostasis in order to readapt to the normal gravitation. Postflight decline in osmotic concentration of urine in cosmonauts was accompanied by an altered response to antidiuretic hormone and was probably caused by changes in the functional state of the kidneys. We conclude that detailed knowledge of the alterations in water-electrolyte metabolism and its hormonal regulation on different stages of space flight are important prerequisites for the development of countermeasures to space deconditioning and thus for increased human efficiency in space. In addition, these data contribute to an increase in our general knowledge on the regulation of kidney function.",[],The Clinical investigator,1994-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Grigoriev', 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedical Problems, Ministry of Health, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Morukov', 'firstname': 'B V', 'initials': 'BV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vorobiev', 'firstname': 'D V', 'initials': 'DV', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/BF00189308,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db94d950>

Energy utilization and energy availability in space seem to be similar to those on Earth. However, negative nitrogen balances in space in the presence of adequate energy and protein intakes and in-flight exercise, suggest that lean body mass decreases in space. Metabolic studies during simulated (bed rest) and actual microgravity have shown changes in blood glucose, fatty acids, and insulin levels, suggesting that energy metabolism may be altered during flight. Future research should focus on the interactions of lean body mass, diet, and exercise in space and their roles in energy metabolism during space flight.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 18-10', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Experiment Number DSO612', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures']",Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),1994-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Lane', 'firstname': 'H W', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Operations and Research Branch, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gretebeck', 'firstname': 'R J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0273-1177(94)90291-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db8e5400>
212,11537960,Pituitary cells in space.,"Cells of the mammalian pituitary gland synthesize and secrete several protein hormones which regulate a number of organ systems throughout the body. These include the musculoskeletal, immune, vascular and endocrine systems. Since changes occur in these tissues as a result of spaceflight, and since pituitary growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) play a role in the control of these systems on earth, we have focused attention over the last 10 years on GH and PRL cell function during and after spaceflight. The cumulative results of 4 spaceflight missions and several mimicked microgravity experiments establish 1) that production and release of biologically active GH and PRL is repeatedly and significantly attenuated (usually > 50%) and 2) that changes in cell morphology also occur. In this paper we describe our results within the framework of methodologies and approaches frequently used to study pituitary cell function on earth. In so doing we hope to develop future flight experiments aimed at uncovering possible microgravity ""sensing systems"" within the pituitary cell.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Cell Biology', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Program Flight', 'Non-NASA Center']",Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),1994-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hymer', 'firstname': 'W C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cell Research, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802.'}, {'lastname': 'Shellenberger', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0273-1177(94)90386-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db8eeb30>
213,11537941,Comparison of the effects of spaceflight and hindlimb-suspension on rat pituitary vasopressin and brainstem norepinephrine content.,"To compare actual spaceflight to ground-based simulation (hindlimb-suspension), we measured the norepinephrine (NE) content in A1, A2, A5 and A6 (locus coeruleus) and the vasopressin content in the neurohypophysial system. The experimental period was of 9 days' duration. The NE content in the locus coeruleus decreased significantly in rats flown for 9 days (67%, p < 0.001), but showed no significant changes after hindlimb-suspension. These results demonstrated that suspended rats adapted better to weightlessness-simulation than flown rats to actual microgravity. In rats flown aboard SLS-1, the vasopressin content was significantly increased in the posterior pituitary (71%, p < 0.01), and was decreased in the hypothalamus (49%, p < 0.05). In 9-day suspended rats pituitary vasopressin levels were unchanged, while in the hypothalamus a significant decrease was noted (21%, p < 0.05). It was concluded that spaceflight changes in pituitary vasopressin levels and in the locus coeruleus NE content were consistent with a stress reaction, occurring during and/or after landing.

214,7757255,Gravitational neuromorphology.,"This review shows that morphological studies of the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system of animals exposed to altered gravity yield data which are extremely significant for our understanding of the mechanisms of adaptation of the nervous system, and of the mammalian organism as a whole, to increased and decreased loading. Neuromorphological studies, correlating structure and function, indicate a decreased activity in weightlessness for spinal ganglia neurons and motoneurons of the spinal cord, as well as the neurons of the hypothalamic nuclei producing arginine vasopressin and growth hormone releasing factor. Structural changes of the somatosensory cortex and spinal ganglia suggest a decreased afferent flow to the somatosensory cortex in microgravity. The results characterize the mechanisms of structural adaptation to a decreased afferent flow in microgravity by the neurons in the hemisphere cortex and brain stem nuclei. There is also morphological evidence for an increased sensitivity of the otolith apparatus and for the development of a hyponoradrenergic syndrome in weightlessness. These studies have shown that both microgravity and the simulation of microgravity effects by tail suspension-induced structural changes in the large neurons of lumbar spinal ganglia and motoneurons of the lumbar spinal cord, which occur under conditions of nerve cell hypoactivity. The structural changes, and consequently the development of neuron hypoactivity, are expressed more extensively after microgravity than after tail suspension for the same length of time. The influence of microgravity and hypergravity on animals is expressed by opposing changes in nervous tissue structure in the spinal ganglia, spinal cord, and nodulus of cerebellar vermis. These changes indicate neuron hypoactivity under microgravity and neuron hyperactivity under 2 G. Morphological assessment of the functional state of other structures of the brain under hypergravity will require further study. Can all structural changes which occur in nerve tissue under microgravity or under hypergravity be explained on the basis of increased or decreased activity of its structural elements? The presently available data regarding the correlation of structure and functional state of cells in brain and spinal cord suggest an affirmative answer. Ultrastructural studies of the nodular cortex of the cerebellum in rats after different duration spaceflights provide what appears to be a convincing example. However, it should be pointed out that the criteria for the morphological assessment of the functional state of single nerve cells will certainly be different from those for groups of neurons connected in a nerve cell network.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",[],Advances in space biology and medicine,1994-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Krasnov', 'firstname': 'I B', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russia.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db905630>

216,11541851,Hormonal responses to head-out water immersion diminish after exposure to head-down tilt.,"It has been postulated that gravitational change from 1 g to microgravity may cause cephalad fluid shift, resulting in suppression of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and diuresis (Gauer-Henry's reflex). However, results obtained in space flights did not confirm this. Since astronauts are confined at supine position for hours before launch, this posture may abolish the reflex in space flight. To investigate this possibility, effects of head-out water immersion (WI) after 2-hour head-down tilt (HDT) on hormonal and metabolic responses were examined and compared with those after 1-hour upright posture (UP). Hematocrit decreased by WI after UP, indicating hemodilution, but it did not change by WI after HDT. Plasma ADH, renin activity and aldosterone fell and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) rose by WI after UP, resulting in increased urine flow. On the other hand, appreciable hormonal changes were not elicited by WI after HDT, and urine flow stayed unchanged. These results indicate that fluid shift and hormonal and metabolic responses to WI are strongly attenuated by the prior exposure to HDT.

This phenomenon was demonstrated by analyzing cells from the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. Phytohemagglutinin-induced T-cell proliferation was depressed in lymph nodes after 11 days of antiorthostatic suspension. In contrast, splenic T-cell proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin was enhanced. Splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity was unchanged after suspension, which demonstrated the organ- and cell-specific effects of skeletal unloading. Whereas antiorthostatic suspension induced minimal changes in bone, there was a significant depression in the number of macrophage precursors in the bone marrow. Overall, skeletally unloaded animals had slightly higher blood corticosterone levels than did control animals; however, it did not appear to be responsible for the observed changes. In conclusion, skeletal unloading produces organ- and cell-specific changes in the murine immune system rather than a generalized immunosuppression.",[],"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1993-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Armstrong', 'firstname': 'J W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'K A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Simske', 'firstname': 'S J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Luttges', 'firstname': 'M W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Iandolo', 'firstname': 'J J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chapes', 'firstname': 'S K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1993.75.6.2734,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db919bd0>
218,8280031,Hormonal changes with lower body negative pressure on the 6th day in microgravity in one cosmonaut.,"We measured volume regulating and stress hormones (AVP, aldosterone, ANP, c-GMP, angiotensin II, PRA, epinephrine, norepinephrine, ACTH, cortisol) in venous blood twice during a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) maneuver in one cosmonaut (31 years, 75 kg, 180 cm) preflight (supine), inflight (6th d in orbit), and on the 4th d (supine) after a 10-d flight. Antecubital blood was taken at the beginning (3 min: ""a"") and after ceasing (2 min: ""b"") 40 min LBNP (-15/-30/-35 mm Hg for 15/15/10 min). At the beginning of LBNP, no big changes of resting hormone levels are to be expected. Comparison of ""a"" values: Inflight, there was a 4-5-fold increase in vasopressin and epinephrine, a slight increase in aldosterone, ANP, norepinephrine, cortisol and ACTH, and a decrease in PRA levels. Postflight, vasopressin was almost as much increased as inflight, and aldosterone and ANP levels were higher than pre- or inflight. PRA, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol were moderately increased, whereas ACTH and angiotensin II were diminished. Comparison of ""b"" to ""a"" values (2 min after LBNP to 3 min intra-LBNP): Preflight, ANP, PRA, and epinephrine rose more than 100%. The inflight response was higher for aldosterone but lower for all other volume active hormones. Postflight, the increase in PRA was pronounced, whereas little change occurred in other hormones. Cortisol and ACTH fell similarly during LBNP under all conditions. In summary, the data provide evidence that not only the endocrine status but also the neuroendocrine responsiveness to stimulation; i.e., the hormone response during cardiovascular load, are altered by the stay in microgravity and readaptation to normal conditions.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1993-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hinghofer-Szalkay', 'firstname': 'H G', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': 'Dept.

219,8371053,The role of psychoneuroendocrine factors on spaceflight-induced immunological alterations.,"This paper summarizes previous in-flight infections and novel conditions of spaceflight that may suppress immune function. Granulocytosis, monocytosis, and lymphopenia are routinely observed following short duration orbital flights. Subtle changes within the monocyte and T cell populations can also be noted by flow cytometric analysis. The similarity between the immunological changes observed after spaceflight and other diverse environmental stressors suggest that most of these alterations may be neuroendocrine-mediated. Available data support the hypothesis that spaceflight and other environmental stressors modulate normal immune regulation via stress hormones, other than exclusively glucocorticoids. It will be essential to simultaneously collect in-flight endocrine, immunologic, and infectious illness data to determine the clinical significance of these results. Additional research that delineates the neuroendocrine mechanisms of stress-induced changes in normal immune regulation will allow clinicians in the future to initiate prophylactic immunomodulator therapy to restore immune competence altered by the stress of long-duration spaceflight and therefore reduce morbidity from infectious illness, autoimmune disease, or malignancy.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Cell Biology', 'NASA Discipline Number 18-10', 'NASA Discipline Number 40-20', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Space Biology', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures', 'Non-NASA Center']",Journal of leukocyte biology,1993-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Meehan', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.'}, {'lastname': 'Whitson', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sams', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1002/jlb.54.3.236,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db8ae5e0>

Results obtained point to the ability of humans to readily adapt to a year-long stay in space and maintain good health and performance.

Primary body system changes were not qualitatively different from findings after flights aboard the Salyut 6 and 7 space stations.

The NE content in the locus coeruleus decreased significantly in spaceflight rats (2.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.9 +/- 0.7 pmol.structure-1 for control rats, p < 0.001), but showed no difference between control and flight animals after a 9-d recovery. These findings were probably due to an acute stress undergone during landing. The NE content was unchanged in the A2 and A5 cell groups. In rats flown aboard SLS-1, the vasopressin content was increased in the posterior pituitary (1.47 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.1 micrograms.structure-1, for control rats, p < 0.01), and was significantly decreased in the hypothalamus (8.95 +/- 2.0 vs. 17.6 +/- 2.2 ng.structure-1, for control rats, p < 0.05). We conclude that the NE depletion in the locus coeruleus and the alteration in vasopressin release were consistent with an acute stress, likely occurring during and/or after landing.

223,8003702,Effect of space flight on the development of endocrine functions in rats.,"The effects of the exposure to space flights on plasma hormone levels were studied in adult male rats, in pregnant females and in their progeny. An increase of plasma corticosterone (CS) and insulin (I) levels was found in male rats after space flights for a period of 7, 15, 18 and 20 days. Plasma levels of growth hormone (GH) were decreased and those of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) were elevated in rats exposed to longer space flights (18 or 20 days). In pregnant female rats no significant changes of plasma concentrations of CS, GH, I, E and NE were noted after short term space flight (5 days). However, the plasma prolactin levels were elevated. In young animals exposed to space flight during fetal development no changes of plasma I and prolactin levels were noted during the period of postnatal growth. However, the plasma CS levels were elevated in these rats and no gradual increase of CS plasma concentration was observed during the postnatal period. The plasma GH levels were reduced in rats exposed to space flight and the levels of catecholamines in plasma and in adrenal glands were elevated in 30 and 100 day old rats exposed to microgravity during the fetal development. These results demonstrated: 1. that exposure of rats to space flight is followed by changes in I and CS plasma levels, but the sympathetic-adrenomedullary system is only slightly activated by longer space flights; 2. that a short term space flight is only a mild stressor for pregnant rats and slightly affects the activity of adrenocortical and sympathetic-adrenomedullary systems during the development of their offsprings.",[],Endocrine regulations,1993-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Macho', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.'}, {'lastname': 'Jezová', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jurcovicová', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kvetnanský', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vigas', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Serová', 'firstname': 'L B', 'initials': 'LB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db8cc2c0>

Mechanisms underlying the deleterious effect of glucocorticoids on bone may include direct inhibition of bone formation as well as indirect effects through changes in intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium excretion, and/or levels of the calciotropic hormones. To further examine the potential role of the calciotropic hormones we measured serum levels of PTH and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], as well as serum and urine levels of calcium and vertebral bone density in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being managed with or without prednisone. Patients treated with prednisone had lower spinal bone density (53 vs. 106 mg/cm3) and higher serum calcium (2.40 vs. 2.33 mmol/l), urine calcium (6.9 vs. 2.7 mmol/24h), and 1,25(OH)2D levels (147 vs. 95 pmol/L). Compared to the patients not treated with glucocorticoids. PTH levels also tended to be higher (33 vs. 26 microliters-eq/ml), but the difference was not significant. Serum and urine calcium levels correlated positively with 1,25(OH)2D levels, but none of these measurements correlated with PTH levels. Our results suggest that prednisone treatment alters the regulation of 1,25(OH)2D production, and this may contribute to the loss of bone mineral induced by prednisone.","['NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 40-40', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Biology', 'Non-NASA Center']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,1993-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bikle', 'firstname': 'D D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine Unit, VA Medical Center, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Halloran', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fong', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Steinbach', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shellito', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1210/jcem.76.2.8432789,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db8dbe50>

The state of the circadian system was assessed from continuous measurements of temperature and ECG, and collections of urine at 3-h intervals for the determination of hormone and electrolyte excretions. Results indicate that only minor changes occurred in rhythm acrophases, whereas daily means for several physiological functions and their circadian amplitudes were significantly altered during the bed-rest phase. These studies using head-down tilt confirm previous findings with horizontal bed rest and indicate that rhythm disturbances can occur without change in the sleep-wake cycle.

Clinical laboratory diagnostics, as defined for medical care on Earth, offers a model for space capabilities. Interpretation of laboratory results for health and medical care of humans in space requires knowledge of specific physiological adaptations that occur, primarily because of the absence of gravity, and how these adaptations affect reference values. Limited data from American and Russian missions have indicated shifts of intra- and extracellular fluids and electrolytes, changes in hormone concentrations related to fluid shifts and stresses of the missions, reductions in bone and muscle mass, and a blunting of the cellular immune response. These changes could increase susceptibility to space-related illness or injury during a mission and after return to Earth.

230,8166854,European isolation and confinement study. Workload and stress: effects on psychosomatic and psychobiological reaction patterns.,"Six healthy males, the EMSInauts, were isolated in hyperbaric chambers for a period of 28 days at 5-msw overpressure. During that period they had to carry out meaningful operational and research tasks in addition to monitoring their psychological and physiological reactions. The actual workload was evaluated and compared with the planned workload, and its effects on symptomatology and psychobiology. The perceived workload and its effects on psychosomatic symptomatology and on some biological indices were monitored. Thus it was possible to evaluate how the workload carried during 4 weeks of isolation affected the psychological and biological well-being of the six EMSInauts. The following three types of assessments were performed: 1. Workload assessment: The objective workload was calculated based on the schedule which was revised daily, and the actual load calculated by the commander. A workload questionnaire was administered daily after each working session. 2. Psychosomatic assessment: Morning and evening questionnaires were administered daily. The state of health and of anxiety were also evaluated. 3. Biological indices: Cortisol, testosterone, adrenalin, and noradrenaline were determined once a week. In addition, cardiac activity was monitored every day. The workload assessment showed that on the average the planned workload was accomplished in slightly less than the scheduled time. The workload was not perceived as severe in terms of cognitive, emotional, and physical load. The group rated the support received from each other and from the mission control personnel as average, with minor changes during the isolation period. They gave a high rating to the amount of control they had over their activities. Fatigue and tension were scored in the middle range. The psychosomatic assessment showed that there were few symptoms, and these were mostly of low severity. The most common symptom was general fatigue. Furthermore, minor dizziness, headache and light tremor was in some cases reported. The sleep quality was good, but complaints about poor sleep increased somewhat with the passing of time. Few and mostly minor health problems were experienced during isolation. Only one EMSInaut had to miss one day of work due to a bout of flu. The state of anxiety was below that of the general population throughout the isolation period. The biological indices used showed no evidence of stress from the workload handled during the isolation period. The level of the ""stress hormone"" cortisol actually decreased during isolation. The adrenalin excretion, which tends to go up during acute stress, remained unchanged during this period.

231,8124504,"European isolation and confinement study.

Confinement is certainly a good and valid method to simulate space station life (with the absence of weightlessness). So, it is interesting to use these confinement studies to perform biological and physiological experiments to obtain greater knowledge, but also to prepare and validate new scientific protocols or new scientific equipment suitable for spaceflights. Even more so, confinement is a good way to prepare and train crew members for long-term space missions. It would seem desirable to confirm the scientific results obtained during the ISEMSI campaign, and especially those for the regulation of the blood volume.

232,1307036,[The effect of space flight on metabolism: the results of biochemical research in rat experiments on the Kosmos biosatellites].,"Cosmos biosatellites research program was the unique possibility to study the metabolic features influenced by space flight factors. Based on the existing ideas about relationships between some metabolic responses, the state of metabolism and the systems of its control in the rats flown in space was evaluated to differentiate the processes occurred in microgravity, possibly under effect of this factor and during first postflight hours. The biochemical results of studying the rats exposed to space environments during 7, 14, 18.5 and 19.5 days and sacrificed 4-11 h after landing (Cosmos-782, -936, -1129, -1667, -2044 flight) are used. The major portion of data are in line with understanding that after landing when the microgravity-adapted rats again return to 1-g environments they display an acute stress reaction. A postflight stress reaction is manifested itself in a specific way as compared to adequate and well studied model of acute and chronic stress and dictates subsequent metabolic changes. Postflight together with the acute stressful and progressing readaptation shifts the metabolic signs of previous adaptation to microgravity are shown up. In the absence of engineering feasibility to control or record the state of metabolism inflight it can only presupposed what metabolic status is typical of the animals in space environments and that its development is triggered by a decreased secretion of the biologically active growth hormone.

233,1526939,Analyses of plasma for metabolic and hormonal changes in rats flown aboard COSMOS 2044.,"Plasma samples from rats flown aboard COS-MOS 2044 were analyzed for the levels of key metabolites, electrolytes, enzymes, and hormones. The major differences between the flight group and the synchronous control were elevations in glucose, cholesterol, phosphate, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate amino-transferase and decreased levels of thyroxine. Most of these differences were not mimicked by tail suspension of ground-based rats; however, both flight and suspended rats exhibited inhibited testosterone secretion. Corticosterone, immunoreactive growth hormone, and prolactin showed inconsistent differences from the various control groups, suggesting that the levels of these hormones were not due to actual or simulated microgravity.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1992-08-11,"[{'lastname': 'Merrill', 'firstname': 'A H', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Rollins Research Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mullins', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Popova', 'firstname': 'I A', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1992.73.2.S132,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db89f590>
234,1526948,Effects of microgravity or simulated launch on testicular function in rats.,"Testes from flight rats on COSMOS 2044 and simulated-launch, vivarium, or caudal-elevation control rats (5/group) were analyzed by subjective and quantitative methods. On the basis of observations of fixed tissue, it was evident that some rats had testicular abnormalities unassociated with treatment and probably existing when they were assigned randomly to the four treatment groups. Considering rats without preexisting abnormalities, diameter of seminiferous tubules and numbers of germ cells per tubule cross section were lower (P less than 0.05) in flight than in simulated-launch or vivarium rats. However, ratios of germ cells to each other or to Sertoli cells and number of homogenization-resistant spermatids did not differ from values for simulated-launch or vivarium controls. Expression of testis-specific gene products was not greatly altered by flight. Furthermore, there was no evidence for production of stress-inducible transcripts of the hsp70 or hsp90 genes. Concentration of receptors for rat luteinizing hormone in testicular tissue and surface density of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in Leydig cells were similar in flight and simulated-launch rats. However, concentrations of testosterone in testicular tissue or peripheral blood plasma were reduced (P less than 0.05) in flight rats to less than 20% of values for simulated-launch or vivarium controls. Thus spermatogenesis was essentially normal in flight rats, but production of testosterone was severely depressed. Exposure to microgravity for greater than 2 wk might result in additional changes. Sequelae of reduced androgen production associated with microgravity on turnover of muscle and bone should be considered.","['NASA Discipline Developmental Biology', 'NASA Experiment Number COS 2044-2', 'Non-NASA Center']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1992-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Amann', 'firstname': 'R P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Animal Reproduction and Biotechnology Laboratory, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.'}, {'lastname': 'Deaver', 'firstname': 'D R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zirkin', 'firstname': 'B R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grills', 'firstname': 'G S', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sapp', 'firstname': 'W J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Veeramachaneni', 'firstname': 'D N', 'initials': 'DN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Clemens', 'firstname': 'J W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Banerjee', 'firstname': 'S D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Folmer', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gruppi', 'firstname': 'C M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1992.73.2.S174,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db828720>
235,1526946,Pituitary oxytocin and vasopressin content of rats flown on COSMOS 2044.,"Preliminary studies in rats (COSMOS 1887) suggested that levels of posterior pituitary hormones were reduced by exposure to spaceflight. To confirm these preliminary findings, we obtained pituitary tissue from rats flown for 14 days on COSMOS 2044. Posterior pituitary content of oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) were measured in these tissues as well as those from ground-based controls. The synchronous control group had feeding and lighting schedules synchronized to those in the spacecraft and were maintained in flight-type cages. Another group was housed in vivarium cages; a third group was tail suspended (T), a method used to stimulate microgravity. Flight rats showed an average reduction of 27% (P less than 0.05) in pituitary OT and VP compared with the three control groups. When hormone content was expressed in terms of pituitary protein (micrograms hormone/mg protein), the average decrease in OT and VP for the flight animals ranged from 20 to 33% (P less than 0.05) compared with the various control groups. Reduced levels of pituitary OT and VP were similar to preliminary measurements from the COSMOS 1887 mission and appear to result from exposure to spaceflight. These data suggest that changes in the rate of hormone secretion or synthesis may have occurred during exposure to microgravity.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1992-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Keil', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California 94035.'}, {'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Krasnov', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1992.73.2.S166,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db834900>
236,1526944,Effects of spaceflight on rat pituitary cell function.,"The secretory capacity of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) cells prepared from rats flown in space on the 12.5-day mission of COSMOS 1887 and the 14-day mission of COSMOS 2044 was evaluated in several postflight tests on Earth. The results showed statistically significant and repeatable decrements in hormone release, especially when biologic (rather than immunologic) assays were used in the tests. Significant and repeatable intracellular changes in GH cells from the flight animals were also found; most important were increases in the GH-specific cytoplasmic staining intensities and cytoplasmic areas occupied by hormone. Tail suspension of rats for 14 days, an established model for mimicking musculoskeletal changes in rats flown in space, resulted in some changes in GH and PRL cell function that were similar to those from animals flown in space. Our results add to a growing body of data that describe deconditioning of physiological systems in spaceflight and provide insights into the time frame that might be required for readaptation of the GH/PRL cell system on return to Earth.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1992-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hymer', 'firstname': 'W C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802.'}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Krasnov', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Victorov', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Motter', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mukherjee', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shellenberger', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vasques', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1992.73.2.S151,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db83c590>
237,1526936,Photoaffinity labeling of regulatory subunits of protein kinase A in cardiac cell fractions of rats.,"The regulatory (R) subunits of adenosine 3',5',-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase were measured by photoaffinity labeling in heart tissue of rats flown on COSMOS 2044. Densitometric analyses showed a significant decrease of RII subunits in the particulate cell fraction extract (S2; P less than 0.05 in all cases) when extracts of tissue samples from vivarium controls were compared with those from flight animals. Photoaffinity labeling of the soluble fraction (S1) was unaffected by spaceflight or any of the simulation conditions. This was previously observed in heart muscle of rats flown on Spacelab 3 and COSMOS 1887 missions. A change in either the number or reactivity of the R subunits apparently results from some aspect of spaceflight. Proteins of the S2 fraction constitute a minor (less than 10%) component of the total, whereas the S1 fraction contained most of the cell proteins. No changes were seen when total incorporation of photoaffinity label was calculated on the basis of adrenal gland weights. A negative correlation resulted on comparison of controls with flight, synchronous control, and a tail-suspended simulation group of animals when incorporation of total counts due to azido labeling was based on body weights. Environmental factors that influence organismic responses may alter individual hormonal responses and may be reflected on the molecular level of organization. Conversely, changes in a relatively minor aspect of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-mediated reactions may be representative of a metabolic effect on an organismic level.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",1992-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Mednieks', 'firstname': 'M I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois, Chicago 60612.'}, {'lastname': 'Popova', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/jappl.1992.73.2.S101,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db844b80>
238,11537597,Changes of hormones regulating electrolyte metabolism after space flight and hypokinesia.,"The changes of hormones in plasma involved in the body fluid regulation were studied in human subjects during and after space flights in relation to redistribution of body fluids in the state of weightlessness. Since hypokinesia was used as a model for simulation of some effects of the stay in microgravity the plasma hormone levels in rats exposed to hypokinesia were also investigated. Plasma aldosterone values showed great individual variations during the first inflight days, the increased levels were observed with prolongation of space flights. The important elevation was found in the recovery period, however it was interesting to note, that in some cosmonauts with repeated exposure to space flight, the postflight plasma aldosterone levels were not elevated. The urine excretion of aldosterone was increased inflight, however in postflight period the decrease or increase were found in the first 1-5 days. The increase of plasma renin activity was observed in flight and postflight period. The rats were exposed to hypokinesia (forced restriction of motor activity) for 1, 7 and 60 days and urine was collected during last 24 hours. The animals were sacrificed and the concentration of electrolytes and of levels of corticosterone, aldosterone (A), ANF and plasma-renin activity (PRA) were determined in plasma. In urine excretion of sodium and potassium were estimated. An important increase of plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration was found after short-term hypokinesia (1 day). These hormonal values appear to decrease with time (7 days) and are not significantly different from controls after long-term hypokinesia (60 days). A decrease of values ANF in plasma was observed after 1 and 7 days hypokinesia. After prolonged hypokinesia a decrease of sodium plasma concentration was observed. The excretion of sodium in urine was higher in long-term hypokinetic animals. There were no significant changes of plasma potassium levels in rats exposed to hypokinesia, however the urinary excretion of potassium was elevated. In rats exposed to hypokinesia for 7 and 60 days an increase of urine osmolality was observed. The results of hormone and electrolyte determination in plasma of cosmonauts after space flight and in experimental animals after hypokinesia suggested that in evaluation of relations between the changes of hormone levels and electrolyte in plasma and urine other factors like emotional stress working load; altered diurnal cycles should be considered in interpretation of homeostatic response of fluid and electrolyte metabolism to space flight conditions.",[],Acta astronautica,1992-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Macho', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, CSFR.'}, {'lastname': 'Fickova', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lichardus', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kvetnansky', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carrey', 'firstname': 'R M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grigoriev', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Popova', 'firstname': 'I A', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tigranian', 'firstname': 'R A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Noskov', 'firstname': 'V B', 'initials': 'VB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0094-5765(92)90175-i,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db84d900>

2952733",Alteration in human mononuclear leucocytes following space flight.,"Reduced in vitro mitogen-stimulated proliferative responses have routinely been observed from astronauts' mononuclear leucocytes following space flight. This study investigated the effect of space flight on subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 shuttle astronauts prior to launch, upon landing and 3 days after flight. The total number of peripheral blood leucocytes, granulocytes and monocytes were increased after space flight (5.7 +/- 0.2 versus 7.0 +/- 0.2; 3.1 +/- 0.1 versus 5.0 +/- 0.1; and 0.16 +/- 0.02 versus 0.25 +/- 0.28 x 10(3) cells/mm3, respectively) whereas lymphocytes were decreased (2.2 +/- 0.1 versus 1.7 +/- 0.1 x 10(3) cells/mm3). Flow cytometry analysis on Ficoll-Hypaque isolated mononuclear cells upon landing revealed significant decreases in T-inducer (CD4+, Leu-8+; 32 +/- 2 versus 23 +/- 2%) and T-cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+, CD11b-; 17 +/- 1 versus 12 +/- 1%), and increases in monocytes (CD14+; 13 +/- 1 versus 21 +/- 1%) compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples whereas B cells (CD19+), T-helper (CD4+, Leu-8-) and T-suppressor (CD8+, CD11b+) populations did not change. Additional phenotypic analysis of these mononuclear leucocytes from 10 crew members upon landing revealed a reduction in natural killer (NK) cells (CD16+ or CD56+; 9 +/- 1 versus 3 +/- 1%) and an increase in monocytes that were negative for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor expression. Flow cytometric analysis indicated these hormone receptor negative monocytes were smaller and less granular than receptor positive monocytes. Therefore, a novel population of monocytes may be released into the peripheral blood during the stress of space flight or upon landing. These findings may explain some of the diverse in vitro immunological and endocrine changes observed in crew members following space flight.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']",Immunology,1992-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Meehan', 'firstname': 'R T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver 80262.'}, {'lastname': 'Neale', 'firstname': 'L S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kraus', 'firstname': 'E T', 'initials': 'ET', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stuart', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cintron', 'firstname': 'N M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sams', 'firstname': 'C F', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db855ef0>
240,1589527,Experiments with suspended cells on the Space Shuttle.,"Spaceflight experiments since 1981 have demonstrated that certain cell functions are altered by micro-g. Biophysical models suggest that cell membranes and organelles should not be affected directly by gravity, however, the chemical microenvironment surrounding the cell and molecular transport could be altered by reduced gravity. Most experiments have used suspended live cells in small chambers without stirring or medium exchange. Flight results include increased attachment of anchorage-dependent human cells to collagen coated microcarriers, reduced secretion of growth hormone from pituitary cells, decreased mitogenic response of lymphocytes, increased Interferon-alpha by lymphocytes, increased Interleukin-1 and Tumor Necrosis Factor secretion by macrophages. Related experiments on cells immediately postflight and on procaryotic cells have shown significant changes in secretory capacity, cell proliferation, differentiation and development. Postulated mechanism include altered cell-cell interactions, altered calcium ion transport, effects on cell cytoskeleton, transport of transmitters and interactions with receptors. The discussion includes use of new molecular methods, considerations for cell environmental control and a preview of several experiments planned for the Shuttle and Spacelab flights to study the basic effects of microgravity on cellular physiology and potential interactions of spaceflight with radiation damage and cellular repair mechanisms.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Cell Biology', 'Non-NASA Center']",The Physiologist,1992-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Morrison', 'firstname': 'D R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Operations and Research Branch, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas 77058.'}, {'lastname': 'Chapes', 'firstname': 'S K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guikema', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Spooner', 'firstname': 'B S', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lewis', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db7e5130>
241,11537105,Biochemical and hematologic changes after short-term space flight.,"Clinical laboratory data from blood samples obtained from astronauts before and after 28 flights (average duration = 6 days) of the Space Shuttle were analyzed by the paired t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compared with data from the Skylab flights (duration approximately 28, 59, and 84 days). Angiotensin I and aldosterone were elevated immediately after short-term space flights, but the response of angiotensin I was delayed after Skylab flights. Serum calcium was not elevated after Shuttle flights, but magnesium and uric acid decreased after both Shuttle and Skylab. Creatine phosphokinase in serum was reduced after Shuttle but not Skylab flights, probably because exercises to prevent deconditioning were not performed on the Shuttle. Total cholesterol was unchanged after Shuttle flights, but low density lipoprotein cholesterol increased and high density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased. The concentration of red blood cells was elevated after Shuttle flights and reduced after Skylab flights. Reticulocyte count was decreased after both short- and long-term flights, indicating that a reduction in red blood cell mass is probably more closely related to suppression of red cell production than to an increase in destruction of erythrocytes. Serum ferritin and number of platelets were also elevated after Shuttle flights. In determining the reasons for postflight differences between the shorter and longer flights, it is important to consider not only duration but also countermeasures, differences between spacecraft, and procedures for landing and egress.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 18-10', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures']",Microgravity quarterly : MGQ,1992-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'NASA/Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db7ea810>
242,11536958,The mechanism by which an asymmetric distribution of plant growth hormone is attained.,"Zea mays (sweet corn) seedlings attain an asymmetric distribution of the growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) within 3 minutes following a gravity stimulus. Both free and esterified IAA (that is total IAA) accumulate to a greater extent in the lower half of the mesocotyl cortex of a horizontally placed seedling than in the upper half. Thus, changes in the ratio of free IAA to ester IAA cannot account for the asymmetric distribution. Our studies demonstrate there is no de novo synthesis of IAA in young seedlings. We conclude that asymmetric IAA distribution is attained by a gravity-induced, potential-regulated gating of the movement of IAA from kernel to shoot and from stele to cortex. As a working theory, which we call the Potential Gating Theory, we propose that perturbation of the plant's bioelectric field, induced by gravity, causes opening and closing of transport channels in the plasmodesmata connecting the vascular stele to the surrounding cortical tissues. This results in asymmetric growth hormone distribution which results in the asymmetric growth characteristics of the gravitropic response.","['NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 40-50', 'NASA Discipline Plant Biology', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Biology', 'Non-NASA Center']",Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),1992-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bandurski', 'firstname': 'R S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1312.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulze', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jensen', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Desrosiers', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Epel', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kowalczyk', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0273-1177(92)90284-5,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db7f3770>
243,1550528,Effects of 1-week head-down tilt bed rest on bone formation and the calcium endocrine system.,"To understand the potential early responses of human bone and the calcium endocrine system to spaceflight, we studied 8 healthy men, aged 35-44 years before, during, and after bed rest in a -6 degrees head-down tilt model for microgravity. Based on a novel single-dose labeling schedule, average rates of bone formation in the iliac crest were reduced in 6, unchanged in 1, and increased in 1 following the bed rest period. The decrease was greatest for subjects whose daily walking miles were highest (r = -0.762, p less than 0.05, n = 7). Before a measurable increase in ionized serum calcium the sixth bed rest day, there was increased excretion of urinary calcium and sodium, evident the first 2 bed-rest days and parallel for the entire week (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001). Reduced excretion of phosphorus and 3', 5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate on the first and second bed rest days was followed by an increase in serum phosphorus by the sixth bed rest day. Depressed serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were manifest by the sixth and seventh bed rest days. The similarity of the response of bone and the calcium endocrine system of healthy men after only 7 days to results of longer term bed rest studies emphasizes the responsiveness of the adult human skeleton to biomechanical stimuli induced by changes in activity and/or position.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal']","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1992-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Arnaud', 'firstname': 'S B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Life Science Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000.'}, {'lastname': 'Sherrard', 'firstname': 'D J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maloney', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Whalen', 'firstname': 'R T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fung', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db7fcc70>
244,1509890,Effect of head-down tilt bedrest (10 days) on lymphocyte reactivity.,"Immunological responses of six healthy males to 10 days of head-down tilt bedrest (HDT) were assessed. Lymphocyte responsiveness was severely reduced immediately before, during, and immediately after the HDT, even though the lymphocyte numbers did not change. By contrast, delayed-type hypersensitivity was not affected. No dramatic changes were found in WBC counts and lymphocyte subpopulations, with the only exception of natural killer (NK) cells which transiently decreased immediately after HDT. Plasma cortisol levels were elevated above normal immediately before and during the HDT. The data suggest that the mitogenic response of lymphocytes was affected by psychological and fluid shift stress. These results are compared with data obtained during and after spaceflight. We conclude that the stress of HDT induces changes in immunological responsiveness that are strikingly similar to those arising from the stress of spaceflight.","['NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']",Acta physiologica Scandinavica.

245,1324562,"Diuresis and natriuresis following isotonic saline infusion in healthy young volunteers before, during, and after HDT.","In the present study the response to acute saline loading was investigated. During a 24-day study period six male subjects followed a standardized diet including a daily intake of 40 ml water and 125 mg NaCl per kg body weight. Before, during, and after a ten-day period of 6 degrees head down tilt (HDT) each volunteer received an intravenous 0.9% saline infusion of 22 ml/kg body weight over 20 minutes. HDT produced significant losses in body weight and in blood volume, but the responses to saline loading were similar during all phases of the study. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) did not increase, while plasma levels of cyclic GMP increased by about 40% 90 minutes after each infusion. Urine flow nearly doubled during second hour post-infusion. Sodium excretion showed a 3-fold increase and remained elevated during the third hour, while potassium excretion was significantly reduced. Urinary excretion of cyclic GMP reached a peak during the second hour post-infusion. At the end of these short-term periods the cumulative water- and sodium-balance data disclosed that only about 20% of the infused water and less than 15% of the infused sodium was excreted during each experiment. In addition to the short-term renal response, urine flow and sodium excretion remained significantly elevated for more than 48 hours after each saline load. The long-term renal response was paralleled by an increased excretion of urinary cyclic GMP.

To obtain insight in the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, we have studied immediate early gene expression in response to activation of cytoplasmic signal transduction under microgravity conditions. In this paper we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced expression of the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes is decreased in microgravity, while no effect of gravity changes was observed on A23187- and forskolin-induced expression of these genes.

A large decrease in impedance, reflecting an increase in thoracic fluid, was apparent within 1 min of tilting, peaked after 45 min, and was maintained throughout, although during the 4 h there was an 8% return towards baseline resistivity. Resistivity changes were most obvious in the region of the lungs. Simultaneous measurements of the key fluid regulating hormones revealed a significant increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and a significant decrease in angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone. There was no significant difference in plasma antidiuretic hormone level.

248,1761722,Metabolic changes observed in astronauts.,"Study of metabolic alterations that occur during space flight can provide insight into mechanisms of physiologic regulation. Results of medical experiments with astronauts reveal rapid loss of volume (2 L) from the legs and a transient early increase in left ventricular volume index. These findings indicate that, during space flight, fluid is redistributed from the legs toward the head. In about 2 days, total body water decreases 2 to 3%. Increased levels of plasma renin activity and antidiuretic hormone while blood sodium and plasma volume are reduced suggest that space flight-associated factors are influencing the regulatory systems. In addition to fluid and electrolyte loss. Skylab astronauts lost an estimated 0.3 kg of protein. Endocrine factors, including increased cortisol and thyroxine and decreased insulin, are favorable for protein catabolism. The body appears to adapt to weightlessness at some physiologic cost. Readaptation to Earth's gravity at landing becomes another physiologic challenge.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 18-10', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures']",Journal of clinical pharmacology,1991-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Operations and Research Branch, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas 77058.'}, {'lastname': 'Cintrón', 'firstname': 'N M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Krauhs', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1002/j.1552-4604.1991.tb03650.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db7ac310>
249,1662483,Cyclic AMP-receptor proteins in heart muscle of rats flown on Cosmos 1887.,"A frequent cellular response to organismal stress is the increase in ligand binding by beta-adrenergic receptors. The extracellular signal is amplified by intracellular increases in cyclic AMP and the ensuing activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK). The molecular mechanisms involve the binding of cyclic AMP to regulatory (R) subunits of cAPK, thus freeing the catalytic subunit for protein phosphorylation. This study was carried out to determine the cellular compartmentalization of the cyclic AMP-receptor proteins in heart ventricular tissue obtained from rats flown on the Cosmos 1887 mission. Photoaffinity labeling of soluble and particulate cell fractions with an [32P]-8-azido analog of cyclic AMP was followed by electrophoretic separation of the proteins and by autoradiographic identification of the labeled isoforms of cAPK R subunits. The results showed that RII in the particulate subcellular fraction was significantly decreased in heart cells from rats in the flight group when compared to controls. Protein banding patterns in both the cytoplasmic fraction and in a fraction enriched in chromatin-bound proteins showed some variability in tissues of individual animals, but exhibited no changes that could be directly attributed to flight conditions. No significant change was apparent in the distribution of RI or RII cyclic AMP binding in the soluble fractions. These findings indicate that the cardiac cell integrity or its protein content is not compromised under flight conditions. There is, however, what appears to be an adaptive molecular response which can be detected using microanalytical methods, indicating that a major hormone regulated mechanism may be affected during some phase of travel in space.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 26-10', 'NASA Experiment Number COS 1887-20', 'NASA Program Flight', 'NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures', 'Non-NASA Center']","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1991-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Mednieks', 'firstname': 'M I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine, IL 60637.'}, {'lastname': 'Popova', 'firstname': 'I A', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db7b2900>

Red cell volume (RCV) and total body water (TBW) decreased more slowly, with average losses of 128 and 1,316 ml, respectively, after 28 d of bed rest. Early in the bed rest, TBW loss was mostly from the ECV. Thereafter, the TBW deficit was derived from the intracellular compartment, which decreased an average of 838 ml after 28 d.

256,11540060,The effect of space flight on the board of the satellite Cosmos 2044 on plasma hormone levels and liver enzyme activities of rats.,"The aim of present experiment was to study the changes of corticosterone, insulin and glucose levels in plasma, of the activity of enzymes involved in aminoacid metabolism in liver and the binding of insulin to specific receptors of cell membrane from liver and also of adipose tissue of rats exposed to space flight for 14 days on biosatellite Cosmos 2044. Adult male Wistar rats (body mass 300-370 g) were divided into five groups: intact control rats (AC), rats exposed to space flight (F), animals in synchronous model experiment (S), rats in antiorthostatic hypokinesia (A) and so called operated control group (C). Half of all groups (5 animals) except the intact control were operated 3 days before the experiment (fibulas on both hind legs were broken). The flight animals were sacrificed 5-6 hours after landing. It was observed that plasma insulin levels are increased in rat exposed to 14-day space flight and in synchron experiments. A significant increase of plasma glucose levels was found in flight rats in spite of high insulin concentrations suggesting that in rats exposed to 14-day space a deterioration of tissue sensitivity to insulin could by present. No significant differences of specific insulin binding to liver plasma membrane fraction in flight and intact control animals were observed. A decrease of insulin binding capacity in liver was found in rats in antiorthostatic hypokinesia (A). However in the membrane of adipocytes an important increase of insulin receptors was noted in rats subjected to space flight. These results suggest, that the liver and adipocyte insulin receptors of flight rats did not respond to the increased plasma insulin levels by ""down regulation"". The determination of plasma corticosterone levels showed that in flight rats and animals exposed to antiorthostatic hypokinesia the plasma hormone levels are significantly elevated. A significant increase of tyrosine aminotransferase and tryptophan pyrrolase activities in liver of flight rats and those exposed to hypokinesia was observed. Also the elevation of alanine amino-transferase in liver was observed in flight rats, while, the activity of aspartate aminotransferase in liver was similar in control and flight animals.

257,11537112,Effect of space flights on plasma hormone levels in man and in experimental animal.,"An important increase of plasma hormone levels like insulin, TSH and aldosterone was observed in human subjects after space flights, however in the changes of plasma content of ACTH, cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline the individual variations were observed in relation to number and duration of space flight. For evaluation of the effects of these changes in plasma hormone levels on metabolic processes also the experiments with small animals subjected to space flights on a board of biosatellite of Cosmos series were running. An elevation of plasma levels of corticosterone, adrenaline, noradrenaline and insulin was found in rats after the space flights of duration from 7 to 20 days. It was demonstrated, that the increase of corticosterone in plasma is followed by the activation of enzymes involved in the amino acid metabolism in rat liver (tyrosine aminotransferase, tryptophanpyrolase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase). After a short recovery period (2 to 6 days) the plasma corticosterone concentration and also the activity of liver enzymes returned to control levels. The exposition of animals to stress stimuli during this revcovery period showed higher response of corticosterone levels in flight rats as compared to intact controls. The increase of plasma catecholamine levels was not followed by elevation of lipolysis in adipose tissue. This is due to lower response of adipose tissue to catecholamine because a decrease of the stimulation of lipolysis by noradrenaline was observed in animals after space flight. The increase of insulin was not followed by adequate decrease of glucose concentration suggesting a disturbances in glucose utilization similarly as in cosmonauts after a long-term space flight.

Body fluid and electrolytes are lost, and blood levels of several hormones that control metabolism are altered during space flight. Increased serum calcium may lead to an increased risk of renal stone formation during flight, and altered drug metabolism could influence the efficacy of therapeutic agents.

261,1915689,Age-related bone changes.,"Bone changes occur during normal aging in both men and women. Changes are both quantitative and qualitative in nature, and include: 1) alterations in the dynamics of bone cell populations, resulting in uncoupling of the normal process of bone resorption and formation; 2) changes in bone architecture (e.g., rearrangement of trabecular struts) and cross-sectional geometry (characterized by subperiosteal expansion and enlargement of the medullary cavity); 3) accumulation of microfractures; 4) localized disparity in the concentration of deposited minerals, with hypomineralization in some areas and hypermineralization in others; 5) changes in the crystalline properties of mineral deposits; and 6) changes in the protein content of matrix material. In addition, there are age-related changes in the status of calcium and phosphate regulating hormones: parathyroid hormone increases, and production of the most active metabolites of vitamin D3 decreases. These hormonal changes undoubtedly affect the maintenance of normal bone homeostasis. Other important factors which can profoundly influence bone status in the elderly are decreased physical activity and dietary inadequacies. Bone tissue is particularly responsive to mechanical loading, and the magnitude of bone mass loss as a consequence of decreased physical activity may not be fully appreciated. Interactions of the above mentioned changes are not completely understood, and the degree to which these changes have been documented in humans varies considerably. Clearly, however, the overall net result is the occurrence of age-related loss of bone tissue and bone strength. This process is accelerated after menopause in women, resulting in the clinical condition commonly known as osteoporosis. In addition to loss of bone mass (usually reported as a decrease in bone mineral content), osteoporosis is accompanied by bone pain, spinal deformity, loss of height, and fractures.",[],Experimental gerontology,1991-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Kiebzak', 'firstname': 'G M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Science Applications International Corporation, Joppa, Maryland 21085.'}]",,,,,10.1016/0531-5565(91)90010-j,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db6b6db0>
262,2149498,Atrial natriuretic factor increases vascular permeability.,"An increase in central blood volume in microgravity may result in increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Since elevations in plasma ANF are found in clinical syndromes associated with edema, and since space motion sickness induced by microgravity is associated with an increase in central blood volume and facial edema, we determined whether ANF increases capillary permeability to plasma protein. Conscious, bilaterally nephrectomized male rats were infused with either saline, ANF + saline, or hexamethonium + saline over 2 h following bolus injections of 125I-albumin and 14C-dextran of similar molecular size. Blood pressure was monitored and serial determinations of hematocrits were made. Animals infused with 1.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 ANF had significantly higher hematocrits than animals infused with saline vehicle. Infusion of ANF increased the extravasation of 125I-albumin, but not 14C-dextran from the intravascular compartment. ANF also induced a depressor response in rats, but the change in blood pressure did not account for changes in capillary permeability to albumin; similar depressor responses induced by hexamethonium were not accompanied by increased extravasation of albumin from the intravascular compartment.

264,2241748,Hormonal changes after parabolic flight: implications on the development of motion sickness.,"Twenty-two different humoral parameters including stress-, gastrointestinal- and volume-regulating hormones were measured before and within 45 min after parabolic flight maneuvers of twenty healthy adult subjects. We compared hormonal data of motion sickness-affected participants with those unaffected. Changes in cortisol and vasoactive intestinal peptide plasma levels were significantly different (p less than 0.002 and p less than 0.004) between the two groups with increasing plasma levels of both hormones during motion sickness but decreasing levels within the control group. Growth hormone and prolactin plasma levels increased by 400% and 115% within the motion sickness-affected group and to a smaller degree (120% and 40% increases, respectively) within the control group, while ACTH levels were almost unchanged within both groups. Pancreatic polypeptide and gastrin plasma levels as well as plasma levels of insulin and C-peptide were significantly decreased within both groups after the parabolic flight. Plasma renin, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic GMP levels were unchanged within the control group. Within the motion sickness-affected group, plasma renin and aldosterone levels were decreased and atrial natriuretic peptide levels increased after the flight. Humoral parameters of the thyroid gland were neither changed within the groups nor different between the groups. The present data confirm previous results that increases in plasma levels of certain stress hormones participate in motion sickness. Furthermore, increases in vasoactive intestinal peptide levels participate in motion sickness. These increases could explain some of the gastrointestinal symptoms in motion sickness and might serve as markers for a discrimination between regular stress and motion sickness.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1990-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Drummer', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Medizinische Klinik Innenstadt, Universität München, FRG.'}, {'lastname': 'Stromeyer', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Riepl', 'firstname': 'R L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'König', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Strollo', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lang', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maass', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Röcker', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gerzer', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db6c99a0>

The results of this study show that following 7 d exposure to a 2 G or 3 G hyperdynamic field, rats exhibited a linear increase in the cytochrome oxidase staining of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The elevated oxidative metabolism in the PVN suggests that there was an increase in the manufacturing and release of vasopressin into the plasma in response to a perceived hypovolemic condition caused by increased hydrostatic pressure and redistribution of fluid to the periphery. Since vasopressin also has widespread cardiovascular effects, it will be important to understand the relationship between vasopressin and altered gravitational fields.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1990-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Murakami', 'firstname': 'D M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Physiology, University of California, Davis 95616.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuller', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db6d26d0>

Intramuscular (IM) medications were then administered. Side effects before and after rotation were reported on the Cornell Medical Index. Brain waves were recorded on a Grass Model 6 Electroencephalograph (EEG), and gastric emptying was studied after an oral dose of 1 mCi Technetium 99m DTPA in 10 oz. isotonic saline. An increase in dizziness and drowsiness was reported with placebo after rotation. This was not prevented by IM scopolamine 0.1 mg or ephedrine 25 mg.

To determine whether decreased osteocalcin, which may reflect altered bone formation rate, could be associated with corticosteroid excess, we measured serum osteocalcin in rats after injection of corticosterone or in response to various environmental stimuli. Exogenous steroid elicited a time- and dose-related decrease in serum osteocalcin, which was significant within 1 h of administration and maximally 25% below controls 1.5 h after injection of 3.3 mg corticosterone/kg body wt, the highest dose we tested. Adrenalectomy resulted in a 38% increase in osteocalcin. Exposure to environmental stressors lasting from 1.5 h to 3 wk also resulted in decreased osteocalcin levels, which showed a strong negative correlation (P less than 0.001) with serum corticosterone levels and adrenal mass after 1-3 wk of chronic cold exposure. Changes in serum osteocalcin were maximally about +/- 40% after 3 wk of chronic exposure to steroid excess or depletion.

After the run, lymphocyte responsiveness was severely depressed to 1-70% of the resting values, even though the lymphocyte counts did not change. Leukocyte counts were elevated 2.8-fold. No dramatic changes were found within the lymphocyte subsets, although an increase in pan T-cells and the helper/inducer subset 2 d after the run was significant. In addition, the numbers of B-cells decreased significantly. No change was observed within the suppressor/cytotoxic subset. Cortisol increased 2.1-fold, epinephrine 3.2-fold and norepinephrine 2.7-fold. All these parameters returned to baseline values within 2 d.

281,11537094,The endocrine system in space flight.,"Hormones are important effectors of the body's response to microgravity in the areas of fluid and electrolyte metabolism, erythropoiesis, and calcium metabolism. For many years antidiuretic hormone, cortisol and aldosterone have been considered the hormones most important for regulation of body fluid volume and blood levels of electrolytes, but they cannot account totally for losses of fluid and electrolytes during space flight. We have now measured atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), a hormone recently shown to regulate sodium and water excretion, in blood specimens obtained during flight. After 30 or 42 h of weightlessness, mean ANF was elevated. After 175 or 180 h, ANF had decreased by 59%, and it changed little between that time and soon after landing. There is probably an increase in ANF early inflight associated with the fluid shift, followed by a compensatory decrease in blood volume. Increased renal blood flow may cause the later ANF decrease. Erythropoietin (Ep), a hormone involved in the control of red blood cell production, was measured in blood samples taken during the first Spacelab mission and was significantly decreased on the second day of flight, suggesting also an increase in renal blood flow. Spacelab-2 investigators report that the active vitamin D metabolite 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased early in the flight, indicating that a stimulus for increased bone resorption occurs by 30 h after launch.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Discipline Number 21-50', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Biomedical Research', 'NASA Program Flight']",Acta astronautica,1988-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'NASA/Johnson Space Center, Biomedical Laboratories, Houston, TX 77058, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'P C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cintrón', 'firstname': 'N M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0094-5765(88)90017-3,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db656270>

The flown rats showed morphological signs of inhibited ADH production. This inhibition may facilitate fluid excretion and development of a new hydration level at an early stage of adaptation to microgravity. The enhanced ADH secretion from neurons of supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and axons of the posterior pituitary may lead to water retention and compensation of water loss after return to Earth's gravity.,[],Kosmicheskaia biologiia i aviakosmicheskaia meditsina,1987-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Alekseev', 'firstname': 'E I', 'initials': 'EI', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db65e720>

The number of thrombocytes, the Quick time, the Howell time and the euglobulinlysis time (ELT) decreased after 1 and 2 weeks of HK; however, after 3 weeks, the parameters of coagulation approached normal control levels, while ELT was still significantly under the control values. An increased blood level of corticosterone in animals subjected to HK suggested that changes observed in the blood coagulation could be linked with it. After exposing rats to heat, similar changes were noticed, i.e. thrombocytopenia and an increase in the speed of coagulation and fibrinolysis. When hyperthermia was induced in hypokinetic animals (after 1 and 2 weeks of HK), the association of exposure to HLK and heat was not followed by a cumulative response.",[],Physiologie (Bucarest),1987-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Groza', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Danielopolu Institute of Normal and Pathological Physiology, Bucharest, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Artino-Rădulescu', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nicolescu', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazăr', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Munteanu', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lungu', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5e4b30>

Analysis of one subject's urine collected during flight showed that a sharp increase in antidiuretic hormone occurred within 2 h of launch, followed by an increase in cortisol excretion. Although this subject had symptoms of the space adaptation syndrome (SAS), inflight data from Spacelab missions suggested that these transient changes were not caused by SAS. Unpaired t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests showed that before and after flight, plasma thyroxine and urine osmolality were significantly higher in Shuttle crewmembers who exhibited more severe symptoms of SAS than in asymptomatic crewmembers. Collection of inflight data from more crewmembers should allow distinction between the effects of SAS and effects of weightlessness, and in the future several additional fluid regulation hormones will be measured in samples from crewmembers for a more complete understanding of fluid control during weightlessness.","['NASA Center JSC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology']","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1987-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Laboratories, NASA/Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas 77058.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5ec450>
285,2959226,[Behavior of the cardiovascular system in outer space].,"One of the important factors in outer space is the absence of gravity (OG). During longterm missions, this factor is responsible for the larger number of anatomical and physiological changes that astronauts experience. The cardiovascular system undergoes these changes with severe intensity, which is part of an adaptation process to the new environmental conditions. The modifications observed in both the anatomy of the cardiovascular system and its hemodynamics occur in two phases. The first phase begins when the astronauts enter into Earth orbit or in interplanetary trajectory and extends until the second or fourth day of the mission. It is characterized by an important shifting of fluids from the lower extremities to the cephalic regions which produces an increase of the venous return and the preload, the heart rate is increased, the blood volume in the thorax is also increased, the cardiac chambers become dilated, and by reflex action, the antidiuretic hormone diminishes, diuresis increases and leads to a virtual state of dehydration. Clinically, the first stage is manifested by headache, dizziness, space disorientation, nausea, anorexia, projectile vomiting, sweating and pallor. This constalation of data is known as ""The Space Adaptation Syndrome"". The second phase begins at the end of the first phase and finishes toward the fortieth or fiftieth day of the mission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",[],Archivos del Instituto de Cardiologia de Mexico,1987-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Iglesias Leal', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Medicina de Aviación, México, D.F.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5f2e50>

Compared with ground-based controls, flight cells appeared to contain more intracellular growth hormone (GH) but release less GH over a 6-day culture period. After implantation into hypophysectomized rats, both sets of flight cells released only 50% of the GH compared with the control cells. Glands from large flight rats contained 44% somatotrophs compared with 37% for controls; small animals showed no difference. There were no striking differences in somatotroph ultrastructure between cells in the four groups. Western blot analysis indicated that there were no major differences in immunoactive GH variants. High-performance liquid chromatography fractionation of culture media indicated that small flight cells released much less of a high-molecular weight variant rich in GH bioactivity. The results suggest that GH cells from rats exposed to microgravity may experience secretory dysfunction. The possibility that this occurs directly at the pituitary cell level is discussed.","['NASA Center ARC', 'NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']",The American journal of physiology,1987-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Grindeland', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hymer', 'firstname': 'W C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Farrington', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fast', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hayes', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Motter', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Patil', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vasques', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1152/ajpregu.1987.252.2.R209,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5f87c0>
287,11538833,Spacelab Life Sciences flight experiments: an integrated approach to the study of cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension.,"The microgravity environment of spaceflight produces rapid cardiovascular changes which are adaptive and appropriate in that setting, but are associated with significant deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension on return to Earth's gravity. The rapidity with which these space flight induced changes appear and disappear provides an ideal model for studying the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension, regardless of etiology. Since significant deconditioning is seen after flights of very short duration, muscle atrophy due to inactivity plays, at most, a small role. These changes in circulatory control associated with cephalad fluid shifts, rather than inactivity per se, are probably more important factors. In order to test this hypothesis in a systematic way, a multidisciplinary approach which defines and integrates inputs and responses from a wide variety of circulatory sub-systems is required. The cardiovascular experiments selected for Spacelab Life Sciences flights 1 and 2 provide such an approach. Both human and animal models will be utilized. Pre- and post-flight characterization of the payload crew includes determination of maximal exercise capacity (bicycle ergometry), orthostatic tolerance (lower body negative pressure), alpha and beta adrenergic sensitivity (isoproterenol and phenylephrine infusions), baroreflex sensitivity (ECG-gated, stepwise changes in carotid artery transmural pressure with a pneumatic neck collar), and responses to a 24 h period of 5 deg head-down tilt. Measurements of cardiac output (CO2 and C2H2 rebreathing), cardiac chamber dimensions (phased-array 2-dimensional echocardiography), direct central venous pressure, leg volume (Thornton sock), limb blood flow and venous compliance (occlusion plethysmography), blood and plasma volumes, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, and various hormonal levels including catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor will also be obtained. The central venous catheter will be inserted immediately pre-launch and monitored with heart rate and blood pressure in-flight until cardiac output, respiratory gas exchange and quantitative 2D echocardiography measurements can be performed. In-flight hemodynamic measurements will be repeated at rest and during submaximal exercise daily and also during maximal exercise midway through the flight to document the timecourse and extent of cardiovascular changes in the payload crew. Parallel studies are planned for the animals. In addition to measurements of right atrial and aortic pressures and cardiac output, a dorsal micro-circulatory chamber will allow determinations of changes in capillary and venular architecture and function in six of the rats. The techniques and findings from many of the SLS-1 and 2 supporting studies have already yielded significant information about circulatory regulation in patients with both hypo- and hypertension. The flight experiments themselves will provide new data to test the validity of both animal and human models currently used for simulating the fluid shifts of a micro-gravity environment. The development of effective countermeasures, not only for short and long duration space travellers, but also for Earth-bound medical patients can then be physiologically based on experimental data rather than anecdote.","['NASA Discipline Cardiopulmonary', 'NASA Discipline Number 00-00', 'NASA Program Flight', 'Non-NASA Center']",Acta astronautica,1987-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Gaffney', 'firstname': 'F A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, University of Texas Health Science Center, Dallas, TX 75235-9034, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1016/0094-5765(87)90074-9,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db600900>
288,3088618,Effects of a seven-day hypokinesia on the digestive tract of nonpregnant and pregnant rats.,"Hypokinesia (HK) produced by a 7-day contention of pregnant rats in small cages is followed by a discrete decrease of PAS reaction for glycoproteins in the submandibular and sublingual glands, in the mucosa of the stomach, duodenum, small intestine and colon, and also by a small but evident increase of that for leucineaminopeptidase and acid phosphatase in the duodenum and in the intestine. The moderation of these reactions may be explained by the small interval of contention, and not by pregnancy, because the changes are similar in male rats after the same interval. After a longer interval, these reactions change in the same manner but they are more evident, as results from our previous studies. They are not connected with a corticosterone hypersecretion (the principal glucocorticoid in rat) because adrenalectomy does not influence them as results from our previous research. HK increases the 4 and 5 isoenzymes of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in the stomach. In the small intestine appeared only the LDH 4 and 5 isoenzymes, HK increases LDH5 isoenzyme. Adrenalectomy increases all LDH isoenzymes of gastric mucosa, and in the small intestine all five fractions appeared, but with a slight activity of LDH 1 and 2. This relation between adrenal hormones and these isoenzymes must be further studied, especially after HK. After a 7-day HK, nonpregnant female rats present an augmented total gastric acid output (TAO), as previously found by us in males. After adrenalectomy this acid hypersecretion disappeared. Even smaller values for TAO were found. Pregnancy considerably increased TAO which may be due, as we have already found, to a blood pH decrease. After HK this hypersecretion decreased remaining nevertheless great. Progeni born of rats submitted to HK have, after 30 days of life, an augmented TAO. Parts of this research were carried out in order to reproduce by HK, at ground level, the 5-day orbital flight conditions of the soviet Cosmos 1514 biosatellite containing pregnant rats in which we studied some identical parameters.",[],Physiologie (Bucarest),1986-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Groza', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bordeianu', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazăr', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dragomirescu', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ionescu', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Boca', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chiţimia', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petec', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db60a0e0>

293,3906741,Failla Memorial lecture. The future of heavy-ion science in biology and medicine.,"Interplanetary space contains fluxes of fast moving atomic nuclei. The distribution of these reflects the atomic composition of the universe, and such particles may pose limitations for space flight and for life in space. Over the past 50 years, since the invention of Ernest Lawrence's cyclotron, advances in accelerator technology have permitted the acceleration of charged nuclei to very high velocities. Currently, beams of any stable isotope species up to uranium are available at kinetic energies of several hundred MeV/nucleon at the Berkeley Bevalac. Recently, new areas of particle physics research relating to the mechanisms of spallation and fission have opened up for investigation, and it is now realistic to search for nuclear super-dense states that might be produced in heavy nuclear collisions. The heavy ions hold interest for a broad spectrum of research because of their effectiveness in producing a series of major lesions in DNA along single particle tracks and because of the Bragg depth ionization properties that allow the precise deposition of highly localized doses deep in the human body. Individual heavy ions can also interrupt the continuity of membraneous regions in cells. Heavy ions, when compared to low-LET radiation, have increased effectiveness for mammalian cell lethality, chromosome mutations, and cell transformation. The molecular mechanisms are not completely understood but appear to involve fragmentation and reintegration of DNA. Cells attempt to repair these lesions, and many of the deleterious effects are due to misrepair or misrejoining of DNA. Heavy ions do not require the presence of oxygen for producing their effects, and hypoxic cells in necrotic regions have nearly the same sensitivity as cells in well-oxygenated tissues. Heavy ions are effective in delaying or blocking the cell division process. Heavy ions are also strong enhancers of viral-induced cell transformation, a process that requires integration of foreign DNA. Some cell lines, known to be radioresistant to X rays, have exhibited greater sensitivity to heavy ions. These radiobiological properties, combined with the ability to deliver highly localized internal doses, make accelerated heavy ions potentially important radiotherapeutic tools. Other novel approaches include the utilization of radioactive heavy beams as instant tracers. Heavy-ion radiography and microscopy respond to delicate changes in tissue electron density. Dose localization with helium ions has achieved excellent results for pituitary tumors, tumors adjacent to the spinal cord, and ocular melanomas. We are working on adapting silicon- and neon-ion beams for controlled therapy studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",[],Radiation research,1985-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Tobias', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5af450>

However, the renal responses are not always associated with the cardiac response, suggesting a possible dissociation of two events. Although the urinary excretion of both ADH and aldosterone decreases during HOI, the mechanism for these changes is not clearly understood. The renal responses to HOI, especially the natriuresis, is considerably attenuated in endurance-trained athletes, which may be related to the more moderate inhibition of both ADH and renin-aldosterone systems. The exact role of the cardiac receptors in inducing the renal responses to HOI is still not defined, although the latter receptors are involved in inducing the natriuresis. Finally, important diurnal variations have been demonstrated for the renal responses to HOI, and elucidation of the mechanism for this interesting phenomenon may help understand the overall mechanisms for the development of cardiorenal-endocrine responses to HOI.",[],Journal of UOEH,1985-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'S K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pendergast', 'firstname': 'D R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Krasney', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Claybaugh', 'firstname': 'J R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5b9860>

It was shown that, when calculated by square centimeter of the decompression area, the effect of UBNP on central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was 3-4 times greater than that of LBNP or LNP.

A combined use of WSS and LBNP during regular exercises led to a distinct water and sodium retention. These changes were mainly determined by the stimulation of the renin-angiotension-aldosterone and antidiuretic systems. After these countermeasures were tested in simulation studies, they were used by 12 cosmonauts during the 63- and 185-d space flights.

302,11542447,Research on the adaptation of skeletal muscle to hypogravity: past and future directions.,"Our current understanding of hypogravity-induced atrophy of skeletal muscles is based primarily on studies comparing pre- and post-flight properties of muscles. Interpretations are necessarily qualified by the assumption that the stress of reentry and readjustment to terrestrial gravity do not alter the parameters being analyzed. The neuromuscular system is highly responsive to changes in functional demands and capable of rapid adaptation, making this assumption questionable. A reexamination of the changes in the connective tissue and synaptic terminals of soleus muscles from rats orbited in biosatellites and sampled postflight indicates that these structural alterations represent adaptative responses of the atrophic muscles to the increased workload of returning to 1 G, rather than hypogravity per se. The atrophy of weightlessness is postulated to result because muscles are both underloaded and used less often. Proper testing of this hypothesis requires quantitation of muscle function by monitoring electromyography, force output and length changes during the flight. Experiments conducted in space laboratories, like those being developed for the Space Shuttle, will avoid the complications of reentry before tissue sampling and allow time course atudies of the rate of development of adaptive changes to zero gravity. Another area of great importance for future studies of muscle atrophy is inflight measurement of plasma levels of hormones and tissue receptor levels. Glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone and insulin exert dramatic regulatory influences on muscle structure. Prevention of neuromuscular atrophy becomes increasingly more important as spaceflights increase in duration. Definition of the atrophic mechanism is essential to developing means of preventing neuromuscular atrophy.",[],Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),1983-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Riley', 'firstname': 'D A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ellis', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0273-1177(83)90056-x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db573b30>

These alterations produce reduced body fluid volume, reduced musculoskeletal mass, and alterations in basal metabolism, resulting in the following consistent findings of space flight: weight loss, altered body composition, decreased orthostatic tolerance, and a compromised ability to deal with physical activity after returning from a space-flight environment. Specific changes include alterations in hydration status, resulting in a relative dehydration, loss of body calcium stores with a concomitant increase in urinary hydroxyproline, skeletal muscular atrophy, and a negative energy balance after prolonged space flight. Numerous endocrine changes have been determined during space flight, but more sensitive assay developed recently will allow careful determination of other hormone levels, and measurement of some of the primary changes that occur during the first hours of space flight.

The increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system before the flight as well as variations in the pressor/depressor prostaglandin ratios indicate an increased strain during the pre-flight period. During the first stage of the post-flight period some parameters were changed due to the landing process and the returning to earth gravity. The associated physical load and the onset of reactions for enhancement of the orthostatic tolerance resulted in an increase of cyclic nucleotid and thyroxine concentrations. The relatively higher levels of the pressor PGs of group F in comparison with the prostaglandins A + E could be evaluated as a compensatory reaction for enhancement of the orthostatic tolerance. The cortisol and STH concentrations increased with growing motor activity. The variations seen after the 7-day space flight were essentially within the reference areas.

The increase of plasma corticosterone concentration and of the activity of rapidly (TAT, TP, SD) and slowly activating enzymes (ALT, AST) was found in F group 6-10 hr after space flight (18.5 days on biosatellite COSMOS 1129). This suggested the presence of acute-stress (associated primarily with the landing) and chronic stress induced hypercorticosteronemia during the flight. After the short 6-day period of recovery the plasma corticosterone concentrations and the activities of liver enzymes returned to control levels. The exposition of animals to repeated immobilization stress showed higher response of corticosterone levels in flight rats as compared to intact controls. No changes in basal lipolysis were observed in flight rats in comparison to intact controls, however the stimulation of lipolysis by norepinephrine was lower in animals from F and SM groups. This lower response of lipolytic processes to norepinephrine was found in flight animals also after six days period of recovery.

Male rats (approximately 130 g) were suspended from the model with a head-down tilt for a two-week period. Total mechanical unloading of the hind limbs and partial unloading of the fore limbs occurred. In comparison to pair-fed control rats, the skeletal alterations in the proximal tibial and humeral metaphyses of suspended rats were determined to be a diminished rate of longitudinal bone growth, a reduced mass of mineralized tissue, and an accumulation of marrow fat. Also, suspended rats exhibited decreased numbers of osteoblasts and increased numbers of osteoclasts immediately adjacent to the growth plate-metaphyseal junction at both skeletal sites. Although the reduction in mineralized tissue and the fat accumulation were more marked in the tibia, the skeletal changes in the proximal tibial and humeral metaphyses were generally comparable.

Activation of central AII receptors in specific brain regions elicits antidiuretic, dipsogenic and pressor responses subsequently producing net body fluid retention. Removal of hydrostatic forces during weightlessness causes a massive translocation of body fluids to the thoraco-abdominal region; physiological adaptation to such a change is manifested as adipsia and net body fluid loss. It is suggested that these events may result from a decrease in the CNS-mediated effects of AII due to suppression of circulating AII levels. Depressed AII activity in the area postrema (AP) may also be responsible for the atypical nausea characteristic of space sickness.",[],Medical hypotheses,1981-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Barrett', 'firstname': 'R J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lokhandwala', 'firstname': 'M F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0306-9877(81)90139-0,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db521ef0>

This hypercorticosteronaemia arises from weightlessness and induces gluconeogenesis. Weightlessness also caused substantial increases in liver glycogen level. The increased lipolytic activity and that of lipoprotein lipase in several groups of animals could be interpreted as enhancement of fat mobilization and utilization under the influence of stress.

Some investigations have suggested that under these conditions muscular and cardiac disorders diminished. In the digestive tract the benefits of centrifugation at 1 g are minimal and limited to a few glycoprotein components.

The decreased food consumption appeared to suppress erythropoiesis by reducing the sensitivity of the target cells in the spleen to erythropoietin (Ep), the erythropoietic hormone. Hemoconcentration decreased titers of Ep thus also suppressing erythropoiesis. Attempts to alleviate the effects of water deprivation and reduced food consumption by effects of water deprivation and reduced food consumption by water injections and the feeding of supplemented diets were only marginally effective at ameliorating the erythroid suppression.

322,12008701,Gravity as a biochemical determinant.,"The existence of obvious morphological and physiological changes in living systems exposed to altered gravity immediately informs us that prior changes have taken place in the chemistry of exposed cells, tissues and organs. These changes include transients that return more or less promptly to the norm when the system is restored to the terrestrial g-field. For example, altered serum hormone and electrolyte levels in man, which appear to reflect successful adaptation to the conditions of orbital weightlessness, disappear shortly after return to Earth. Other changes--in mineral and protein constituents of the skeletal system in man, and cell wall composition in plants--are more persistent or even permanent. Hypogravitational departures from the norm include not only ""weightlessness"" as achieved in orbit, but also experimental modes of compensation, on the clinostat or by flotation. These techniques are useful in the study of hypogravity but cannot replace fully the weightless environment. Plant ethylene and peroxidase both increase under orbital, clinostat and/or flotation conditions whereas 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde-dehydrogenase increases under orbital but not clinostat conditions; cytochrome reductase and malic dehydrogenase levels are affected by the clinostat, but not by actual weightless conditions. How do the altered organismal biochemistries induced by the centrifuge and the clinostat relate to one another? Does gravity operate on living systems as a continuous variable from 0 to superterrestrial values, or do deviations from g(earth) generate non-uniform, discontinuous stress responses, irrespective of sign? In plants, measurements of wall lignin content and peroxidase activity yield opposite answers. Given the limited data so far available we will consider the meaning of these contradictions.",[],Life sciences and space research,1979-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Siegel', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1016/b978-0-08-023416-8.50024-6,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5140e0>

327,11829024,Space motion sickness medications: interference with biomedical parameters.,"The possibility that drugs administered to Skylab 3 (SL-3) and 4 (SL-4) crewmen for space motion sickness may have interfered with their biomedical evaluation in space was investigated. Healthy volunteers received combinations of Scopolamine/Dexedrine for four days in regimens similar to those used in these missions. Urine samples, heart rate, body temperature, mood and performance were analyzed for drug-related changes. Twenty-four hour urine samples were analyzed by the same procedures as those used to analyze the flight samples. Hormone concentrations determined included cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In addition, volume, specific gravity, osmolarity, sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), chloride (Cl), inorganic phosphate, uric acid and creatinine were measured. Performance was not affected by the Scopolamine/Dexedrine. The drug combination increased daily mean heart rate (HR) significantly in all the subjects and daily mean rectal temperature (RT) in some of the subjects. A 2-4 hr phase shift in the HR circadian rhythm was also observed which indicates that internal circadian synchrony was disturbed by the drugs. Psychological and subjective evaluation indicated that the subjects could usually identify which days they were given the drugs by an increase in tension and anxiety, decreased patience, restlessness, decreased appetite, difficulty in sleeping and feelings of increased heart rate and body temperature. Urinary electrolytes were not changed significantly by the drug, but marked and significant changes occurred in urine volume and hormone excretion patterns. Scopolamine/Dexedrine caused consistent elevations in urinary cortisol and epinephrine and a transient elevation in ADH. Norepinephrine excretion was decreased, but there was no significant change in aldosterone excretion or in 24 hr urine volume. A comparison of these findings with the first four days of inflight data from the SL-3 and SL-4 missions leads to the conclusion that the dramatic increases in aldosterone excretion during the first three days of spaceflight probably can be directly attributed to weightlessness, whereas the antimotion sickness medication could have substantially contributed to the early increased excretion of epinephrine and cortisol during these missions.",[],Acta astronautica,1977-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Vernikos-Danellis', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Research Div., NASA, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Winget', 'firstname': 'C M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rosenblatt', 'firstname': 'L S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lyman', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beljan', 'firstname': 'J R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0094-5765(77)90094-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4b7950>
328,179519,Metabolic and endocrine studies: the second manned Skylab mission.,"This study conducted on the crewmembers of Skylab 3 was designed to evaluate the endocrinological adaption resulting from extend exposure to a space flight environment by identifying changes in hormonal and associated fluid and electrolyte parameters. The three men served as their own controls and were on a constant dietary intake. Complete metabolic collections were performed beginning 21 d before the flight, continuing throughout the flight, for 18 d postflight. Changes in fluid and electrolyte balance have been correlated with weight loss, changes in the excretion of aldosterone, vasopressin, and fluid compartments. Inter-individual variability was demonstrated in most experimental indices measured; however, statistically significant patterns have emerged which include: decreases in body weight and ADH, increases in plasma renin activity, and elevations in urinary catecholamines, aldosterone and cortisol concentrations. Urinary sodium was increased in flight but potassium was only slightly changed. Total body exchangeable K was slightly decreased in all three of the crewmen. Total body water and extracellular fluid were decreased postflight in almost all cases. The measured changes are consistent with the prediction that a relative increase in thoracic blood volume upon transiton to the zero gravity environment is interpretated as a true volume expasion resulting in a net fluid loss. This, in association with other factors, ultimately results in a reduction in intravascular volume leading to an increase in renin and a secondary aldosteronism. Once these compensatory mechanisms are effective in reestablishing positive water balance, the crewemn are considered to be essentially adapted to the space environment. Although the physiological cost of this adaptation must reflect the electrolyte deficit and perhaps other factors, it is assumed that the compensated state is adequate for the demands of the environment; however, this new homeostatic set is not believed to be without physiological cost and could, except with proper precautions, reduce the functional reserve of exposed individuals.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",1976-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'P C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rambaut', 'firstname': 'P C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4c3590>

On the 10th flight day the animals were exposed to 24-hour gamma irradiation: some animals were irradiated at a dose of 220 rad and the others at a dose of 800 rad. The data were compared with the results obtained from two control groups one day and 26 days after the experiment: (i) rats kept in the vivarium and fed with a special diet, and (ii) rats from a synchronous experiment (which simulated the flight profile with the exception only of weightlessness). The studies showed the following changes one day after flight: an increase in the concentration of total cholesterol, glucose, urea and corticosterone in the blood plasma, an increase in the concentration of triglycerides in the plasma, liver and bone marrow, a decrease in the concentration of total cholesterol in the adrenals, a reduction in the DNA and RNA content in the spleen and bone marrow, a decline in the potassium concentration together with an increase in the sodium concentration in soleus muscle.

330,175211,[Pathophysiology of prolonged hypokinesia].,"Hypokinesia is an important problem in modern medicine. In the pathogenetic effect of prolonged hypokinesia the main etiological factor is diminished motor activity; of major importance are disorders in the energy and plastic metabolism which affect the muscle system; the contributing factors are cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic intolerance. This is attributed to a decreased oxygen supply and eliminated hydrostatic influences during a prolonged recumbency. Blood redistribution in the vascular bed is related to the Gauer-Henry reflex and subsequent changes in the fluid-electrolyte balance. Decreased load on the bone system induces changes in the protein-phosphate-calcium metabolism, diminished bone density and increased calcium content in the blood and urine. Changes in the calcium metabolism are systemic. The activity of the higher nervous system and reflex functions is lowered. Changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system which include a noticeable decline of its adaptive-trophic role as a result of the decrease of afferent and efferent impulsation are of great importance. Changes in the hormonal function involve a peculiar stress-reaction which develops at an early stage of hypokinesia as a response to an unusual situation. Prolonged hypokinesia may result in a disturbed function of the pituitary-adrenal system. It is assumed that prolonged hypokinesia may induce a specific disease of hypokinesia during which man cannot lead a normal mode of life and work.",[],Kosmicheskaia biologiia i aviakosmicheskaia meditsina,1976-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Kovalenko', 'firstname': 'E A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4d6cc0>
331,11887911,Study of water-salt metabolism and renal function in cosmonauts.,"In manned space flights the renal function and water-salt metabolism undergo substantial changes. With the reserve capabilities of kidneys in mind, their function and regulation of the water-salt balance were investigated in cosmonauts postflight and in Earth-bound simulation experiments with the aid of water loading, hormonal injections (pituitrin, engiotensin, DOCA, ACTH); water- and ion-release were also studied during LBNP and physical exercises. The cosmonauts who performed space flights of 2 to 5 days showed water retention and increased urine excretion of salts during the first postflight days in response to a water load. After the 18-day flight water excretion remained unchanged whereas salt excretion increased. The capacity for osmotic concentration and urine dilution did not alter. The study of the hormonal effect in simulation experiments of different duration demonstrated a normal renal response to the hormonal excretion. After the LBNP tests and physical exercises the water- and salt-excretion declined; a correlation between the level of water- and salt-excretion and the level of these loads was established. The data on the blood- and urine-ionic composition, excretion of nitrogen metabolites, and hormones postflight as well as the results of load and functional tests suggest that changes in the renal function of cosmonauts in weightlessness are associated with regulatory effects on the kidney rather than disturbances in the function of nephron cells.",[],Acta astronautica,1975-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Natochin', 'firstname': 'Y V', 'initials': 'YV', 'affiliation': 'Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Leningrad, USSR.'}, {'lastname': 'Kozyrevskaya', 'firstname': 'G I', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': ""Grigor'yev"", 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0094-5765(75)90088-0,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4dff40>
332,11841088,Endocrine responses in long-duration manned space flight.,"The bioassay of body fluids experiment is designed to evaluate the biochemical adaptation resulting from extended exposure to space flight environment by identifying changes in hormonal and associated fluid and electrolyte parameters reflected in the blood and urine of the participating crewmen. The combined stresses of space flight include weightlessness, acceleration, confinement, restraint, long-term maintenance of high levels of performance, and possible desynchronosis. Endocrine measurements to assess the physiological cost of these stresses have been considered from two aspects. Fluid and electrolyte balance have been correlated with weight loss, changes in the excretion of aldosterone and vasopressin and fluid compartments. The second area involves the estimation of the physiological cost of maintaining a given level of performance during space flight by analysis of urinary catecholamines and cortisol. Inter-individual variability was demonstrated in most experimental indices measured; however, constant patterns have emerged which include: body weight change; increases in plasma renin activity; elevations in urinary catecholamines, ADH, aldosterone and cortisol concentrations. Plasma cortisol decreases in immediate postflight samples with subsequent increase in 24-hour urines. The measured changes are consistent with the prediction that a relative increase in thoracic blood volume upon transition to the zero-gravity environment is interpreted as a true volume expansion resulting in an osmotic diuresis. This diuresis in association with other factors ultimately results in a reduction in intravascular volume, leading to an increase in renin and a secondary aldosteronism. Once these compensatory mechanisms are effective in reestablishing positive water balance, the crewmen are considered to be essentially adapted to the null-gravity environment.
