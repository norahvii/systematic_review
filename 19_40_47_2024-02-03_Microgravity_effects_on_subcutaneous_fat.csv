0,12182212,Yohimbine administration prevents over-responsiveness to epinephrine induced by simulated microgravity.,"Simulated microgravity produces sustained inhibition of sympathoneural release, turnover, and synthesis of norepinephrine (NE) and hypersensitization of beta-adrenergic pathways. These changes may explain the orthostatic intolerance experienced by astronauts returning from spaceflights.
Chronic administration of yohimbine would prevent the increase of beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity to epinephrine (Epi) induced by simulated microgravity.
Eight healthy young subjects received 8 mg of yohimbine (an antagonist of alpha2adrenoceptors) orally twice a day during the simulated microgravity achieved through -6 degrees head-down bed rest (HDBR). The catecholamine-induced lipolysis was studied on isolated fat cells from subcutaneous adipose tissue before HDBR and on the fifth day of HDBR. Epi was infused at three graded rates (0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 40 min each) before and at the end of the HDBR period. The effects of Epi on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity-assessed by plasma NE levels and spectral analysis of systolic BP and heart rate variability-and on plasma levels of glycerol, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, and insulin and on energy expenditure were evaluated.
Under yohimbine treatment, HDBR failed to modify urinary NE excretion and spectral variability of systolic BP in the mid-frequency range. The beta- and alpha-adrenergic sensitivity of fat cells were not modified by HDBR nor were plasma NE levels and spectral variability of systolic BP induced by Epi infusion. No alteration of Epi-induced changes in heart rate and systolic and diastolic BPs were observed after HDBR. Epi-induced increases in plasma glucose, insulin, glycerol, and non-esterified fatty acid levels as well as energy expenditure were also unmodified by HDBR. Only the Epi-induced plasma lactate level was increased by HDBR.
Our data suggest that the increase in the effects of Epi induced during microgravity could be attenuated by chronic administration of yohimbine. An explanation for this effect could be SNS activation brought about by the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist properties of yohimbine.",[],"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",2002-08-17,"[{'lastname': 'Berlan', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacologie Medical and Clinical Laboratory, INSERM U-317, Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France. berlan@cict.fr'}, {'lastname': 'Verhaeghe', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pavy-Le Traon', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Thalamas', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lafontan', 'firstname': 'Max', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marques', 'firstname': 'Marie Adeline', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Senard', 'firstname': 'Jean Michel', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Parent', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Galitzky', 'firstname': 'Jean', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,Our data suggest that the increase in the effects of Epi induced during microgravity could be attenuated by chronic administration of yohimbine.

1,3600254,Changes in nuclear magnetic resonance (T2) relaxation of limb tissue with bed rest.,"Bed rest is used to simulate the effects of weightlessness on human physiology. A spin-echo procedure was used to image the lower leg of 15 normal male volunteers before and after 5 weeks of horizontal bedrest. In addition to noninvasively measuring muscle size changes, accurate T2 images were produced to investigate possible relaxation time changes immediately (2-4 h) and 1-2 days after bed rest. Subcutaneous fat showed no change in T2, bone marrow showed a decrease, and muscle showed no change immediately after bed rest but increased 1-2 days following reambulation.",[],Magnetic resonance in medicine,1987-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'LeBlanc', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schonfeld', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ford', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schneider', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jhingran', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1002/mrm.1910040509,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df9ed2c0>
