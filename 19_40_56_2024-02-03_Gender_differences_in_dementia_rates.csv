0,38299756,"Validity, feasibility, and effectiveness of a voice-recognition based digital cognitive screener for dementia and mild cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older Chinese adults: A large-scale implementation study.","We investigated the validity, feasibility, and effectiveness of a voice recognition-based digital cognitive screener (DCS), for detecting dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a large-scale community of elderly participants.
Eligible participants completed demographic, cognitive, functional assessments and the DCS. Neuropsychological tests were used to assess domain-specific and global cognition, while the diagnosis of MCI and dementia relied on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale.
Among the 11,186 participants, the DCS showed high completion rates (97.5%) and a short administration time (5.9 min) across gender, age, and education groups. The DCS demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCs) of 0.95 and 0.83 for dementia and MCI detection, respectively, among 328 participants in the validation phase. Furthermore, the DCS resulted in time savings of 16.2% to 36.0% compared to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montral Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
This study suggests that the DCS is an effective and efficient tool for dementia and MCI case-finding in large-scale cognitive screening.
To our best knowledge, this is the first cognitive screening tool based on voice recognition and utilizing conversational AI that has been assessed in a large population of Chinese community-dwelling elderly. With the upgrading of a new multimodal understanding model, the DCS can accurately assess participants' responses, including different Chinese dialects, and provide automatic scores. The DCS not only exhibited good discriminant ability in detecting dementia and MCI cases, it also demonstrated a high completion rate and efficient administration regardless of gender, age, and education differences. The DCS is economically efficient, scalable, and had a better screening efficacy compared to the MMSE or MoCA, for wider implementation.","['community-dwelling older adults', 'dementia', 'digital cognitive screening', 'effectiveness', 'feasibility', 'large scale', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'validity']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2024-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Xuhao', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital of School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.

24378195",Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Southern Regions of Colombia.,"Recent reports suggest that by 2050 there will be an increase of around 310% of cases affected by dementia in Latin American countries. A previous study in a Southern region reported one of the highest prevalences of dementia in Latin America.
To investigate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment associated with low education, rurality, and demographic characteristics.
A cross-sectional study recruited a community-dwelling sample of 823 adults from rural and urban areas of two Southern provinces of Colombia from 2020-2022. Participants were assessed with a neuropsychological protocol validated in Colombia. To obtain general and region-specific prevalence rates, age, sex, schooling, and socioeconomic level were considered and controlled for.
Most of the participants reported low education and socioeconomic level, the participation of women was higher. It was determined that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 53.6%, with 56.6% in the province of Caquetá followed by 51.9% in the province of Huila. The amnestic MCI represented 42.6%, the amnestic multi-domain was 39%, the non-amnestic 16.55%, and the non-amnestic multi-domain 1.81%. Our participants reported comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. We also observed a relationship between exposure to pesticides and MCI.
We observed one of the highest prevalences of MCI in Latin America reported to date. Variables such as age, gender, and education proved risk factors for MCI in the explored regions. Our findings are very much in line with recent studies that highlight the influence of non-canonical risk factors of dementia in underrepresented countries from Latin America.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'epidemiology', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'pesticides', 'prevalence']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports,2024-01-16,"[{'lastname': 'Bonilla-Santos', 'firstname': 'Jasmin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Neiva, Colombia.\nNeurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'González-Hernández', 'firstname': 'Alfredis', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cala-Martínez', 'firstname': 'Dorian Yisela', 'initials': 'DY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Neiva, Colombia.\nNeurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gómez-Morales', 'firstname': 'Duván Fernando', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Calceto-Garavito', 'firstname': 'Laura Natalia', 'initials': 'LN', 'affiliation': 'Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Forero-Aldana', 'firstname': 'Arnulfo Eduardo', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad de la Amazonía, Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'González-Montealegre', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo Alberto', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cardona Cumaco', 'firstname': 'Yeing Alexandra', 'initials': 'YA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Universidad de la Amazonía, Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rojas-Bernal', 'firstname': 'Luz Angela', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Instituto del cerebro, Hospital Universitario Mayor Méderi, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia.\nClinical Neuropsychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zabaleta-Orozco', 'firstname': 'Mario Alberto', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Hernando Moncaleano University Hospital, Neiva, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Parra', 'firstname': 'Mario Alfredo', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Sciences and Health, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.'}]",,,"Most of the participants reported low education and socioeconomic level, the participation of women was higher.

32610143",Identification of female-enriched and disease-associated microglia (FDAMic) contributes to sexual dimorphism in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of dementia; it disproportionally affects women in terms of both incidence rates and severity of progression. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this clinical phenomenon remain elusive and ill-defined.
In-depth analyses were performed with multiple human LOAD single-nucleus transcriptome datasets to thoroughly characterize cell populations in the cerebral cortex. ROSMAP bulk human brain tissue transcriptome and DNA methylome datasets were also included for validation. Detailed assessments of microglial cell subpopulations and their relevance to sex-biased changes at the tissue level were performed. Clinical trait associations, cell evolutionary trajectories, and transcription regulon analyses were conducted.
The relative numbers of functionally defective microglia were aberrantly increased uniquely among affected females. Substratification of the microglia into different subtypes according to their transcriptomic signatures identified a group of female-enriched and disease-associated microglia (FDAMic), the numbers of which were positively associated with disease severity. Phenotypically, these cells exhibit transcriptomic signatures that support active proliferation, MHC class II autoantigen presentation and amyloid-β binding, but they are also likely defective in phagocytosis. FDAMic are likely evolved from female activated response microglia (ARMic) with an APOE4 background and compromised estrogen receptor (ER) signaling that is deemed to be active among most subtypes of microglia.
This study offered important insights at both the cellular and molecular levels into how ER signaling affects microglial heterogeneity and function. FDAMic are associated with more advanced pathologies and severe trends of cognitive decline. Their emergence could, at least in part, explain the phenomenon of greater penetrance of the APOE4 genotype found in females. The biases of FDAMic emergence toward female sex and APOE4 status may also explain why hormone replacement therapy is more effective in APOE4 carriers. The pathologic nature of FDAMic suggests that selective modulations of these cells may help to regain brain neuroimmune homeostasis, serving as a new target for future drug development.","['Bioinformatics', 'Estrogen receptor signaling', 'Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease', 'Microglia', 'Sex dimorphism']",Journal of neuroinflammation,2024-01-05,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Deng', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 999077, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bi', 'firstname': 'Xiaoman', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Biomedical Information and Engineering, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, 571199, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chow', 'firstname': 'Kim Hei-Man', 'initials': 'KH', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 999077, China. heimanchow@cuhk.edu.hk.\nGerald Choa Neuroscience Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 999077, China. heimanchow@cuhk.edu.hk.\nNexus of Rare Neurodegenerative Diseases, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 999077, China. heimanchow@cuhk.edu.hk.'}]",,"This study offered important insights at both the cellular and molecular levels into how ER signaling affects microglial heterogeneity and function.

29159516",Predictive model for a second hip fracture occurrence using natural language processing and machine learning on electronic health records.,"Hip fractures (HFx) are associated with a higher morbidity and mortality rates, leading to a significant reduction in life quality and in limitation of patient´s mobility. The present study aimed to obtain real-world evidence on the clinical characteristics of patients with an initial and a second hip fracture (HFx) and develop a predictive model for second HFx using artificial intelligence. Electronic health records from one hospital centre in Spain from January 2011 to December 2019 were analysed using EHRead® technology, based on natural language processing and machine learning. A total of 1,960 patients with HFx were finally included during the study period after meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria. From this total, 1835 (93.6%) patients were included in the HFx subgroup, while 124 (6.4%) were admitted to the second HFx (2HFx) subgroup. The mean age of the participants was 84 years and 75.5% were female. Most of comorbidities were more frequently identified in the HFx group, including hypertension (72.0% vs. 67.2%), cognitive impairment (33.0% vs. 31.2%), diabetes mellitus (28.7% vs. 24.8%), heart failure (27.6% vs. 22.4%) and chronic kidney disease (26.9% vs. 16.0%). Based on clinical criteria, 26 features were selected as potential prediction factors. From there, 16 demographics and clinical characteristics such as comorbidities, medications, measures of disabilities for ambulation and type of refracture were selected for development of a competitive risk model. Specifically, those predictors with different associated risk ratios, sorted from higher to lower risk relevance were visual deficit, malnutrition, walking assistance, hypothyroidism, female sex, osteoporosis treatment, pertrochanteric fracture, dementia, age at index, osteoporosis, renal failure, stroke, COPD, heart disease, anaemia, and asthma. This model showed good performance (dependent AUC: 0.69; apparent performance: 0.75) and could help the identification of patients with higher risk of developing a second HFx, allowing preventive measures. This study expands the current available information of HFx patients in Spain and identifies factors that exhibit potential in predicting a second HFx among older patients.",[],Scientific reports,2024-01-05,"[{'lastname': 'Larrainzar-Garijo', 'firstname': 'Ricardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedic and Trauma Department, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Medical School, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernández-Tormos', 'firstname': 'Esther', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedic and Trauma Department, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Collado-Escudero', 'firstname': 'Carlos Alberto', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedic and Trauma Department, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Alcantud Ibáñez', 'firstname': 'María', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Department, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Medical School, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Oñorbe-San Francisco', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedic and Trauma Department, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Marin-Corral', 'firstname': 'Judith', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Savana Research Group: Medsavana & Savana Research S.L., Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Casadevall', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Savana Research Group: Medsavana & Savana Research S.L., Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Donaire-Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Savana Research Group: Medsavana & Savana Research S.L., Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Sanchez', 'firstname': 'Luisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Savana Research Group: Medsavana & Savana Research S.L., Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cabal-Hierro', 'firstname': 'Lucia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Savana Research Group: Medsavana & Savana Research S.L., Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Benavent', 'firstname': 'Diego', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Savana Research Group: Medsavana & Savana Research S.L., Madrid, Spain. dbenavent@savanamed.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Brañas', 'firstname': 'Fátima', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Department, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Medical School, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.'}]",,,,© 2024.

35579697",Geriatric distal femoral fractures: post-operative complications and nine-year mortality-a retrospective analysis of two tertiary trauma centres.,"This study aimed to estimate the mortality at various post-operative intervals and explore influential variables for these outcomes in elderly patients with distal femur fractures (DFF).
A retrospective observational study was conducted across two tertiary care institutions, between 2014 and 2020. The primary outcomes were mortality rates at 30-day, six month, and one year post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included 1-year readmission and reintervention rates along with their correlated complications.
A total of 37 DFF in 35 patients was analyzed; average age was 83.6 years (range, 65-98 years). The overall mortality rate at a maximum follow-up of 8.8 years was 74% (26/35 patients). The median survival time was 3.2 years and the survival probability at five years was 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 43%). Mortality rates at 30 days, six months, and one year after surgery were 8.6% (3 patients), 23% (8 patients), and 34% (12 patients), respectively. Overall mortality rate was 64% (15/24 patients) for native distal femur fractures, and 92% (13/14 patients) for periprosthetic fractures (p = 0.109). Patients older than 85 years and male gender were identified as risk factors for mortality within the first year post-operatively.
Elderly fractures have a high mortality at eight years of follow-up. Mortality at one year was much higher than in other studies of the same nature. We did not find statistically significant differences when comparing native bone fractures with periprosthetic fractures. Factors that impact mortality were being a man, advanced age, elevated index comorbidity, and dementia.

5,38130217,[Risk factors and prognosis of preoperative herat failure after hip fracture].,"To explore incidence, risk factors and the relationship between preoperative heart failure and prognosis in elderly patients with hip fracture.
A retrospective analysis was performed on 1 569 elderly patients with hip fracture treated from January 2012 to December 2019, including 522 males and 1 047 females, aged 81.00 (75.00, 90.00) years old;896 intertrochanteric fractures and 673 femoral neck fractures. Patients were divided into heart failure and non-heart failure groups according to whether they developed heart failure before surgery, and heart failure was set as the dependent variable, with independent variables including age, gender, fracture type, comorbidities and hematological indicators, etc. Univariate analysis was performed at first, and independent variables with statistical differences were included in multivariate Logistic regression analysis. Independent risk factors for preoperative heart failure were obtained. The length of hospital stay, perioperative complications, mortality at 30 days and 1 year after surgery were compared between heart failure and non-heart failure groups.
There were 91 patients in heart failure group, including 40 males and 51 females, aged 82.00 (79.00, 87.00) years old;55 patients with intertrochanteric fracture and 36 patients with femoral neck fracture.

6,37993040,Trends in Cardiovascular Mortality Among Patients With Alzheimer's Disease in the United States from 1999 to 2020.,"This study aimed to compare the trends in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)-related mortality in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the general population aged ≥65 years. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Multiple Cause of Death dataset were used to determine national trends in age-adjusted CVD mortality rates (AAMR) and average annual percent change (AAPC) values in patients with AD and the overall population aged ≥65 years from 1999 to 2020. Data for AAMR and AAPCs were also stratified by age, gender, ethnicity/race, geographical region, urbanization status, and subgroups of CVD. Trends in the overall AAMR stratified by gender, age, ethnicity/race, geographical region, urbanization status, and CVD subgroups were statistically different between patients with AD and the overall population (overall AAPC for CVD mortality rate in patients with AD = -3.5% [confidence interval -4.1% to -2.9%] vs -2.6% [confidence interval -2.3% to -2.9%] in overall population, p = 0.01). Differences in the decrease in the mortality rates between patients with AD and the overall population were found to be statistically different across all stratifications except for the change in the mortality rates for hypertensive diseases (p = 0.05), females (p = 0.2), and Asian or Pacific Islanders (p = 0.09). In conclusion, CVD-related mortality in patients with AD decreased over the last 2 decades, and decreases were more prominent than seen in the general population aged ≥65 years. These results may help focus public health efforts to optimize CVD health in patients with AD.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cardiovascular-mortality']",The American journal of cardiology,2023-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Ranganathan', 'firstname': 'Sruthi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Abramov', 'firstname': 'Dmitry', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Chew', 'firstname': 'Nicholas W S', 'initials': 'NWS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Mallen', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Keele University, Staffordshire, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall', 'firstname': 'Michelle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Hillel Yaffe Medical Center, Hadera, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Kobo', 'firstname': 'Ofer', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Keele University, Staffordshire, United Kingdom; Department of Cardiology, Hillel Yaffe Medical Center, Hadera, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Mamas', 'firstname': 'Mamas A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Keele University, Keele, United Kingdom.

7,37962725,"Intimate Partner Violence, Mental Health, and Aging-Related Health Among Men and Women Veterans Across the Lifespan.","A growing body of evidence suggests adverse health outcomes related to intimate partner violence (IPV), including traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, most research in this area has focused on reproductive-aged women.
To examine relationships between IPV (with and without TBI), mental health, and aging-related health outcomes among men and women Veterans across the lifespan.
Cross-sectional analysis of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data from fiscal years 2000-2019. Descriptive statistics and chi-square analyses were used to compare key comorbidities in matched samples of Veterans with and without IPV (gender-stratified and matched 1:3 based on demographics and index date). Comparisons between those with IPV and TBI relative to IPV alone were also examined.
Veterans aged 18 + with and without documented IPV in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health records (n = 4108 men, 2824 women).
ICD codes were used to identify IPV, TBI, and aging-related medical (sleep disorder, hypertension, diabetes, dementia) and common psychiatric (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder) diagnoses.
Demographic characteristics were reflective of VA-enrolled Veterans (men: mean age 66, SD 16; 72% non-Hispanic White; women: mean age 47, SD 13; 64% non-Hispanic White). Relative to Veterans without IPV, both men and women with IPV had higher rates of all examined medical (e.g., sleep disorders, men: 33% vs. 52%; women: 45% vs. 63%) and psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., depression, men 32% vs. 74%; women 59% vs. 91%; all ps < .001), with evidence of an additive effect of TBI on some psychiatric outcomes.
IPV is broadly associated with aging-related and mental health, and TBI is a common correlate that may further contribute to psychiatric outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of trauma-informed care and recognizing the potential role of these exposures on men and women Veterans' health across the lifespan.","['chronic disease', 'gender differences', 'intimate partner violence', 'mental health', 'veterans']",Journal of general internal medicine,2023-11-14,"[{'lastname': 'Gibson', 'firstname': 'Carolyn J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco VA Health Care System, San Francisco, CA, USA.

8,37936540,Incremental health care resource utilization and costs associated among patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis and incident dementia: An analysis of medicare beneficiaries.,"Real-world evidence examining the incremental health care resource use (HCRU) and cost burden of incident dementia among patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) are needed within the United States (US).
To compare HCRU and cost burden between PDP patients with incident dementia (PDP + D) versus without incident dementia (PDP).
A retrospective analysis of inpatient (Part A), outpatient (Part B), and prescription drug (Part D) claims from the 100% Medicare sample was conducted to compare PDP + D patients versus PDP patients between 01/01/14-12/31/18. Patients with a diagnosis of dementia, psychosis, secondary parkinsonism, or other psychotic disorders, during 12-month pre-index were excluded. Patients in both groups were matched using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) methodology using 31 variables (age, sex, race, region and 27 Elixhauser comorbidity characteristics). Differences in 12-month post-index HCRU rates and mean per patient per year (PPPY) costs for all-cause inpatient (IP) hospitalizations, and by type of IP stay (i.e., short-term [ST-stay], skilled nursing facility [SNF-stay] and long-term [LT-stay]) were analyzed via logistic and gamma log-link regression models.
Of the 12,484 patients who met our study criteria, 1855 PSM-matched cohorts were identified. Mean age, gender, and comorbidities were similar in PSM groups. Approximately, 50.3% with PDP + D reported ≥1 all-cause IP hospitalizations versus 36.0% with PDP (p < 0.05) during 12-month follow-up. Specifically, all-cause ST-stay, SNF-stay, and LT-stay among PDP + D versus PDP patients were: 45.2% versus 35.7%, 28.3% versus 15.7%, and 8.5% versus 6.0% (p < 0.05), respectively. Psychiatric-related ST-stay, SNF-stay, and LT-stay among PDP + D versus PDP patients were: 12.3% versus 9.0%, 7.5% versus 3.4%, and 2.4% versus 1.2% (p < 0.05), respectively. Mean PPPY all-cause IP hospitalization costs for PDP + D patients versus PDP patients was $17,891 (±29,882) versus $11,599 (±$25,247) (p < 0.05).
Patients with PDP + D experience significantly higher all-cause and psychiatric-related IP hospitalizations, including ST-stays, LT stays, and SNF stays. They also had 54% greater mean PPPY IP hospitalization costs versus PDP patients.","[""Parkinson's disease psychosis"", 'dementia', 'health care resource utilization', 'hospitalizations', 'medicare']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2023-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Rajagopalan', 'firstname': 'Krithika', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Anlitiks Inc., Orlando, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rashid', 'firstname': 'Nazia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Acadia Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gopal', 'firstname': 'Daksha', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Anlitiks Inc., Orlando, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Doshi', 'firstname': 'Dilesh', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Acadia Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, California, USA.'}]",,,"Of the 12,484 patients who met our study criteria, 1855 PSM-matched cohorts were identified.

9,37930762,The effect of a smoking cessation program for patients in cancer treatment: a quasi-experimental intervention study.,"Compared to non-smokers, smokers have reduced effects of cancer treatment, and increased risk of treatment-related toxicity. Quitting smoking can improve treatment effects and reduce side effects. This study reports on the potential impact of a smoking cessation program on smoking cessation rates among patients in cancer treatment.
Cancer patients 18 years and older who smoked, with survival prognosis ≥12 months, not suffering dementia or other mental illness, and who were referred to cancer treatment at six Norwegian hospitals were invited to participate. The study took place from 2017 to 2020 and used a pre-test-posttest non-equivalent control group design. The intervention group received structured smoking cessation guidance based on Motivational Interviewing combined with cost-free nicotine replacement products, while the control group received standard smoking cessation treatment. Self-reported smoking status were registered at baseline and at 6 months' follow up.
76% of patients smoked at baseline and 44% at follow-up in the intervention group, correspondingly 72% and 49% in the control group. In an analysis of differences in within-person change, the reduction in the intervention group was 13 percentage points larger (95% CI = (0.25, -0.005),

10,37838489,Computed Tomography Imaging of Geriatric Patients with Uncertain Head Trauma.,"Although clinical decision rules exist for patients with head injuries, no tool assesses patients with unknown trauma events. Patients with uncertain trauma may have unnecessary brain imaging.
This study evaluated risk factors and outcomes of geriatric patients with uncertain head injury.
This prospective cohort study included geriatric patients with definite or uncertain head injury presenting to two emergency departments (EDs). Patients were grouped as definite or uncertain head trauma based on history and physical examination. Outcomes were intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head computed tomography (CT), need for neurosurgical intervention, and mortality. Risk factors assessed included gender, alcohol use, tobacco use, history of dementia, anticoagulant use, antiplatelet use, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 15.
We enrolled 2905 patients with definite head trauma and 950 with uncertain head trauma. Rates of acute ICH (10.7% vs. 1.5%; odds ratio [OR] 8.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.67-13.76), delayed ICH (0.7% vs. 0.1%; OR 6.58; 95% CI 4.67-13.76), and neurosurgical intervention (1.2% vs. 0.3%; OR 3.74; 95% CI 1.15-12.20) were all higher in definite vs. uncertain head injuries. There were no differences in mortality. Patients with definite trauma had higher rates of ICH with male gender (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.24-1.99), alcohol use (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.25-2.09), antiplatelet use (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.46-2.31), and GCS score < 15 (OR 3.24; 95% CI 2.54-4.13). Patients with uncertain trauma had no characteristics associated with increased ICH.
Although ICH rates among patients with uncertain head trauma was eight times lower than those with definite head trauma, the risk of ICH is high enough to warrant CT imaging of all geriatric patients with uncertain head injury.","['Emergency medicine', 'Geriatrics', 'Head imaging', 'Head trauma']",The Journal of emergency medicine,2023-10-15,"[{'lastname': 'Turchiaro', 'firstname': 'Michael L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Florida Atlantic University Charles E.

16224307",Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Misidentification of Dementia in Medicare Claims: Results from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project.,"Misidentification of dementia in Medicare claims is quite common.
We examined potential race/ethnic disparities in misidentification of dementia in Medicare claims in a diverse cohort of older adults who underwent careful clinical assessment.
Participants were enrolled in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), a multiethnic, population-based, prospective study of cognitive aging in which dementia status was assessed using a rigorous clinical protocol. ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes in all available Medicare claims (1999-2019) were compared to clinical dementia diagnosis and categorized into three mutually exclusive groups: 1) congruent-, 2) over-, and 3) under- identification during the study period. Multinomial logistic regression model was used to examine the relationship between race (White, African American/Black, other) and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latinx, non-Hispanic/Latinx) and congruency of dementia identification after controlling for clinical (cognition, function, comorbidities) and demographic characteristics (age, sex, education), and inpatient and outpatient utilization.
Across all person-years, 88.4% had congruent identification of dementia compared to clinical diagnosis, in 4.1% of the times participants were over-identified with dementia, and 7.5% of the times the participants were under-identified. Rates of misidentification was higher in minority participants than in White, non-Hispanic participants. Multivariable estimation results showed that the probability of over-identification with dementia was 2.2% higher for African American/Black than White (p = 0.05) and 2.7% higher for Hispanic participants than non-Hispanics (p = 0.03) participants. Differences in under-identification by race/ethnicity were not statistically significant.

12,37625452,Incidence Morbidity and Mortality From Falls in Skilled Nursing Facilities: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The primary objective of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the incidence and consequential morbidity and mortality from falls in skilled nursing facilities. Our secondary objective is to synthesize current evidence on risk factors for injurious falls.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Older adults residing in skilled nursing facilities or similar settings.
We completed study screening, data extraction, and quality assessment in duplicate. Random effects models were used for meta-analysis of fall incidence rates and proportions of outcomes per fall. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were completed to assess differences based on study design, quality, and population characteristics. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias tools were used to assess quality of observational and intervention-based studies, respectively. The GRADE tool was used to evaluate strength of evidence for fall risk factors.
We identified 3103 unique references, of which 38 were included in systematic review and 37 in meta-analysis. Pooled incidence of falls was 121 per 100 person-years (95% CI 86-170). Outcomes of transfer to hospital, admission to hospital, overall injury, head injury, fracture, 30-day mortality, death in hospital, and disability were reported by included studies. Sensitivity analysis indicated no significant difference in fall rates between study designs. Meta-regression indicated no significant relationship between fall rate and age or sex; however, a weak positive correlation was identified with increasing prevalence of dementia. No fall risk factors were supported by high-quality evidence.
Our study confirms that falls in skilled nursing facilities are common and cause significant morbidity, mortality and health system use. As populations in high-income countries age, falls will become increasingly prevalent. Future research should be directed at preventing injurious falls and determining when hospital care will benefit a faller.","['Aged', 'SNF', 'falls', 'morbidity', 'mortality', 'systematic review']",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2023-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Kimura', 'firstname': 'Maren', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruller', 'firstname': 'Sydney', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Frank', 'firstname': 'Cairina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bell', 'firstname': 'Alison', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Jacobson', 'firstname': 'Micaela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pardo', 'firstname': 'Jordi Pardo', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramsey', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sobala', 'firstname': 'Monica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""St. Patrick's Home of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Fung', 'firstname': 'Celeste', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""St. Patrick's Home of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; Department of Family Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Kobewka', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; St. Patrick's Home of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

32439001",Impacts of baseline biomarkers on cognitive trajectories in subjective cognitive decline: the CoSCo prospective cohort study.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the rates of cognitive decline are variable according to underlying pathologies and biomarker status. We conducted an observational study and aimed to investigate baseline characteristics and biomarkers related with cognitive declines in SCD. Our study also assessed whether SCD participants showed different cognitive and biomarker trajectories according to baseline amyloid deposition.
This study is a part of a longitudinal cohort study conducted in multi-centers in South Korea between 2018 and 2021. Individuals (≥ 60 years old) with persistent cognitive complaint despite of normal cognitive functions were eligible for the study. All participants underwent neuropsychological tests, florbetaben PET scans, plasma amyloid markers, and brain MRI scans. Annual follow-up evaluations included neuropsychological tests and assessments for clinical progressions. Regional brain volumetry and amyloid burden represented by PET-based standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were measured. We compared cognitive and brain atrophic changes over 24 months between amyloid positive-SCD (Aβ + SCD) and amyloid negative-SCD (Aβ-SCD) groups. Baseline factors associated with cognitive outcomes were investigated.
A total of 120 participants with SCD were enrolled and 107 completed follow-up evaluations. Aβ + SCD participants (n = 20, 18.5%) were older and more frequently APOE4 carriers compared with Aβ-SCD participants (n = 87). Baseline cognitive scores were not different between the two groups, except the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) scores showing lower scores in the Aβ + SCD group. After 24 months, plasma amyloid markers were higher, and regional volumes (entorhinal, hippocampal, and pallidum) were smaller in the Aβ + SCD participants compared with Aβ-SCD participants adjusted by age, sex, and baseline volumes. SVLT delayed recall and controlled oral word association test (COWAT) scores indicated more declines in Aβ + SCD participants.

Aβ + SCD participants (n = 20, 18.5%) were older and more frequently APOE4 carriers compared with Aβ-SCD participants (n = 87). Baseline cognitive scores were not different between the two groups, except the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) scores showing lower scores in the Aβ + SCD group. After 24 months, plasma amyloid markers were higher, and regional volumes (entorhinal, hippocampal, and pallidum) were smaller in the Aβ + SCD participants compared with Aβ-SCD participants adjusted by age, sex, and baseline volumes. SVLT delayed recall and controlled oral word association test (COWAT) scores indicated more declines in Aβ + SCD participants.

30045942",Clinical profile and survival analysis of Alzheimer's disease patients in a Brazilian cohort.,"To investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a large sample of patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) who were followed up at a cognitive neurology outpatient clinic.
Retrospective, longitudinal, and descriptive design. We collected data from patients with dementia due to AD who visited the outpatient clinic of the SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between May 2009 and June 2019. The evaluated characteristics included age of onset, sex, education, family history, comorbidities, time until diagnosis, and survival rates.
Overall, 1434 patients were evaluated, 74% of whom were women, with a mean age at symptom onset of 72.7 years and 75.8 at diagnosis. A positive family history was reported in 602 patients, with a first-degree relative in 86.3% of them. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity, affecting 61.2% of the sample, and 16.2% were classified as having early-onset AD. The mean survival rate for the sample population was 112.8 months (9.4 years). The sample population was positively affected by dyslipidaemia.
This study presents a clinical and epidemiological analysis of a large and diverse group of patients with AD. The study confirms previous observations such as a higher prevalence of AD in women, low education among sufferers, and the presence of a family history. The study also found that comorbidities significantly affected patient survival and provides new data on the survival rates of patients with early and late AD in the Brazilian population.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Brazil', 'Survival analysis']",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2023-08-04,"[{'lastname': 'de Melo Queiroz', 'firstname': 'Elisa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals, Avenida Abelardo Bueno, 1500, Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22775-040, Brazil. elisqueiroz78@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Marques Couto', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals, Avenida Abelardo Bueno, 1500, Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22775-040, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'da Cruz Mecone', 'firstname': 'Cláudio Antônio', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals, Avenida Abelardo Bueno, 1500, Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22775-040, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Souza Lima Macedo', 'firstname': 'Waneska', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals, Avenida Abelardo Bueno, 1500, Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22775-040, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Caramelli', 'firstname': 'Paulo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology Research Group, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Professor Alfredo Balena, 190 - Santa Efigênia, Belo Horizonte, 30130-100, Brazil.'}]",,,"Overall, 1434 patients were evaluated, 74% of whom were women, with a mean age at symptom onset of 72.7 years and 75.8 at diagnosis.

16,37491381,Endovascular therapy in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion and patent circle of Willis.,"Occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) may extend into the middle or anterior cerebral artery (ICA-T) or be confined to the intracranial (ICA-I) or extracranial segment (ICA-E). While there is excellent evidence for endovascular therapy (EVT) in ICA-T occlusions, studies on EVT in non-tandem ICA-I or ICA-E occlusions are scarce.
To characterize EVT-treated patients with ICA-I- and ICA-E occlusion by comparing them with ICA-T occlusions.
The German Stroke Registry (GSR), a national, multicenter, prospective registry was searched for EVT-treated patients with isolated ICA occlusion between June 2015 and December 2021. We stratified patients by ICA occlusion site: (a) ICA-T, (b) ICA-I, (c) ICA-E. Baseline factors, procedural variables, technical (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI)), and functional outcomes (modified Rankin scale score at 3 months) were analyzed.
Of 13 082 GSR patients, 2588 (19.8%) presented with an isolated ICA occlusion, thereof 1946 (75.2%) ICA-T, 366 (14.1%) ICA-I, and 276 (10.7%) ICA-E patients. The groups differed in age (77 vs 76 vs 74 years, P
Patient characteristics and outcomes differ substantially between ICA-T, ICA-I, and ICA-E occlusions.

Baseline assessments of factors, such as language, drooling, halitosis, hypersalivation, tongue movement, perioral muscle function, coughing, respiration after swallowing, rinsing, and oral residue, among others, were conducted. A score of 0 was considered positive, and a score of 1 or 2 was considered negative. Patient age, sex, body mass index, Barthel index, and Clinical Dementia Rating were recorded. The death/hospitalization or survival rates over 1 year were recorded, and patients were allocated into groups depending on the respective outcome (death/hospitalization group or survival group) and baseline characteristics. A total of 986 residents from 32 facilities were included, with 216 in the death/hospitalization group and 770 in the survival group. Language, salivation, halitosis, perioral muscle, coughing, respiration after swallowing, rinsing, and oral residue were significantly associated with the outcomes (","['drooling', 'eating', 'geriatric care', 'geriatrics', 'gerodontology', 'halitosis', 'long-term care facility', 'rinsing', 'swallowing function']","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-07-14,"[{'lastname': 'Takeda', 'firstname': 'Maaya', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Gerodontology, Department of Oral Health Science, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8586, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Yutaka', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Gerodontology, Department of Oral Health Science, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8586, Japan.\nTokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Itabashi-ku 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Taira', 'firstname': 'Kenshu', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Gerodontology, Department of Oral Health Science, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8586, Japan.\nDepartment of Public Health and Hygiene, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara 903-0215, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Miura', 'firstname': 'Kazuhito', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Gerodontology, Department of Oral Health Science, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8586, Japan.\nTokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Itabashi-ku 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ohara', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Itabashi-ku 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iwasaki', 'firstname': 'Masanori', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Itabashi-ku 173-0015, Japan.\nDivision of Preventive Dentistry, Department of Oral Health Science, Graduate School of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8586, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ito', 'firstname': 'Kayoko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Oral Rehabilitation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata 951-8520, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakajima', 'firstname': 'Junko', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral Medicine and Hospital Dentistry, Tokyo Dental College, Ichikawa 272-8513, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iwasa', 'firstname': 'Yasuyuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dentistry, Haradoi Hospital, Fukuoka 813-8588, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Itoda', 'firstname': 'Masataka', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral Rehabilitation, Osaka Dental University Hospital, Osaka 573-1144, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nishi', 'firstname': 'Yasuhiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Prosthodontics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima 890-8544, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Yoshihiko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Healthcare Management, Tohoku Fukushi University, Sendai 981-8522, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kishima', 'firstname': 'Masako', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dentistry, Wakakusa-Tatsuma Rehabilitation Hospital, Daito 574-0012, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hirano', 'firstname': 'Hirohiko', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Itabashi-ku 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shirobe', 'firstname': 'Maki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Itabashi-ku 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Minakuchi', 'firstname': 'Shunsuke', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Gerodontology and Oral Rehabilitation, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku 113-8549, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshida', 'firstname': 'Mitsuyoshi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dentistry and Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, Toyoake 470-1192, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamazaki', 'firstname': 'Yutaka', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Gerodontology, Department of Oral Health Science, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8586, Japan.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/healthcare11131827

23759278",The role of sex differences in depression in pathologically defined Alzheimer's disease.,"Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may contribute to disease heterogeneity and affect prevalence, risk factors, disease trajectories and outcomes. Depression impacts a large number of patients with AD and has been reported to be more prevalent in women. We aimed to better understand the interaction between sex, depression and AD neuropathology, which could have implications for detection of symptoms, earlier diagnosis, therapeutic management, and enhanced quality of life.
We compared 338 cases with clinicopathologically confirmed AD (46% women) to 258 control cases (50% women), without dementia, parkinsonism or a significant pathological diagnosis. Depression was assessed both, using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), and as being reported in their medical history combined with treatment with antidepressant medication.
In the control group, women showed a higher depression severity, and a higher proportion of women were found to meet the cut-off score for depression on the HAM-D (32 vs. 16%) and having an history of depression (33 vs. 21%), while these sex differences were not observed in AD. Further, in both groups, female sex independently predicted the presence of depression, with covariates for age and cognitive status. AD subjects had higher mean HAM-D scores, were more likely to meet cutoff scores for depression (41 vs. 24%) and have a history of depression than controls (47 vs. 27%). When comparing the increase in frequency of depression in controls versus AD, the difference was significantly greater in men (AD men - control men: 24%) than in women (AD women - control women: 9%). Although subjects with depression were more likely to have higher levels of AD neuropathology, these differences were not observed when investigating the control or AD group separately.
Control women had a higher likelihood and severity of depression than control men, but this sex difference was not noted when considering only those with pathologically defined AD, emphasizing the importance of considering sex in aging studies. AD was associated with higher rates of depression and men may be more likely to report or be diagnosed with depression once they develop AD indicating the importance of more frequent depression screenings in men.","['Hamilton rating scale for depression', 'behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia', 'depression', 'gender', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychaitric symptoms', 'postmortem', 'sex differences']",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023-05-26,"[{'lastname': 'Tremblay', 'firstname': 'Cécilia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Choudhury', 'firstname': 'Parichita', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Belden', 'firstname': 'Christine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldfarb', 'firstname': 'Danielle', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Lorenzini', 'firstname': 'Ileana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Beach', 'firstname': 'Thomas G', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Serrano', 'firstname': 'Geidy E', 'initials': 'GE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}]",,,"In the control group, women showed a higher depression severity, and a higher proportion of women were found to meet the cut-off score for depression on the HAM-D (32 vs. 16%) and having an history of depression (33 vs. 21%), while these sex differences were not observed in AD.

5015581",Analyses of hospitalization in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in a tertiary hospital.,"To characterize the pattern of hospitalization in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), and compare the differences to see whether AD patients and PD patients have a different picture of hospitalization.
The clinical features of all consecutive patients from January 2017 to December 2020 were reviewed. We identified AD patients and PD patients from an electronic database in a tertiary medical center.
The study group comprised 995 AD patients and 2,298 PD patients who were admitted to the hospital for the first time, and re-hospitalized 231 AD patients and 371 PD patients were also included. AD patients were older than PD patients when they were hospitalized (
The present study found that AD patients and PD patients have a significantly different picture of hospitalization. It is important to implement different management for hospitalized AD and PD, and different emphasis should be given when establishing primary prevention strategies, informing care needs, and guiding healthcare resource planning.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", 'a tertiary hospital', 'analyses', 'hospitalization']",Frontiers in public health,2023-05-22,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Sihui', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Jiajia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Xiaohui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Management Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bao', 'firstname': 'Ting', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Management Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Xueping', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shang', 'firstname': 'Huifang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.'}]",,,"The study group comprised 995 AD patients and 2,298 PD patients who were admitted to the hospital for the first time, and re-hospitalized 231 AD patients and 371 PD patients were also included.

20,36928611,"Racial, ethnic and neighborhood socioeconomic differences in incidence of dementia: A regional retrospective cohort study.","Evidence on the effects of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage on dementia risk in racially and ethically diverse populations is limited. Our objective was to evaluate the relative extent to which neighborhood disadvantage accounts for racial/ethnic variation in dementia incidence rates. Secondarily, we evaluated the spatial relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and dementia risk.
In this retrospective study using electronic health records (EHR) at two regional health systems in Northeast Ohio, participants included 253,421 patients aged >60 years who had an outpatient primary care visit between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2015. The date of the first qualifying visit served as the study baseline. Cumulative incidence of composite dementia outcome, defined as EHR-documented dementia diagnosis or dementia-related death, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation (as measured by Area Deprivation Index) was determined by competing-risk regression analysis, with non-dementia-related death as the competing risk. Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard ratios were determined for neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation, race/ethnicity, and clinical risk factors. The degree to which neighborhood socioeconomic position accounted for racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of composite dementia outcome was evaluated via mediation analysis with Poisson rate models.
Increasing neighborhood disadvantage was associated with increased risk of EHR-documented dementia diagnosis or dementia-related death (most vs. least disadvantaged ADI quintile HR = 1.76, 95% confidence interval = 1.69-1.84) after adjusting for age and sex. The effect of neighborhood disadvantage on this composite dementia outcome remained after accounting for known medical risk factors of dementia. Mediation analysis indicated that neighborhood disadvantage accounted for 34% and 29% of the elevated risk for composite dementia outcome in Hispanic and Black patients compared to White patients, respectively.
Neighborhood disadvantage is related to the risk of EHR-documented dementia diagnosis or dementia-related death and accounts for a portion of racial/ethnic differences in dementia burden, even after adjustment for clinically important confounders.","['dementia', 'racial/ethnic disparities', 'socioeconomic disparities']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2023-03-18,"[{'lastname': 'Becerril', 'firstname': 'Alissa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pfoh', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nCenter for Value-Based Care Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hashmi', 'firstname': 'Ardeshir Z', 'initials': 'AZ', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nCenter for Geriatric Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mourany', 'firstname': 'Lyla', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gunzler', 'firstname': 'Douglas D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Center for Healthcare Research and Policy, Case Western Reserve University at MetroHealth, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Berg', 'firstname': 'Kristen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Healthcare Research and Policy, Case Western Reserve University at MetroHealth, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Krieger', 'firstname': 'Nikolas I', 'initials': 'NI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Krishnan', 'firstname': 'Kamini', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'Scott Emory', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kahana', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Sociology Department, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawson', 'firstname': 'Neal V', 'initials': 'NV', 'affiliation': 'Center for Healthcare Research and Policy, Case Western Reserve University at MetroHealth, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Luezas Shamakian', 'firstname': 'Lorella', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Medicine, MetroHealth, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'James W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Medicine, MetroHealth, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perzynski', 'firstname': 'Adam T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'Center for Healthcare Research and Policy, Case Western Reserve University at MetroHealth, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dalton', 'firstname': 'Jarrod E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}]",,"Neighborhood disadvantage is related to the risk of EHR-documented dementia diagnosis or dementia-related death and accounts for a portion of racial/ethnic differences in dementia burden, even after adjustment for clinically important confounders.","Increasing neighborhood disadvantage was associated with increased risk of EHR-documented dementia diagnosis or dementia-related death (most vs. least disadvantaged ADI quintile HR = 1.76, 95% confidence interval = 1.69-1.84) after adjusting for age and sex.

18301192",Effects of Dementia on Outcomes after Cervical Spine Injuries in Elderly Patients: Evaluation of 1512 Cases in a Nationwide Multicenter Study in Japan.,"We aimed to retrospectively investigate the demographic characteristics and short-term outcomes of traumatic cervical spine injuries in patients with dementia. We enrolled 1512 patients aged ≥ 65 years with traumatic cervical injuries registered in a multicenter study database. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of dementia, and 95 patients (6.3%) had dementia. Univariate analysis revealed that the dementia group comprised patients who were older and predominantly female and had lower body mass index, higher modified 5-item frailty index (mFI-5), lower pre-injury activities of daily living (ADLs), and a larger number of comorbidities than patients without dementia. Furthermore, 61 patient pairs were selected through propensity score matching with adjustments for age, sex, pre-injury ADLs, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale score at the time of injury, and the administration of surgical treatment. In the univariate analysis of the matched groups, patients with dementia had significantly lower ADLs at 6 months and a higher incidence of dysphagia up to 6 months than patients without dementia. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with dementia had a higher mortality than those without dementia until the last follow-up. Dementia was associated with poor ADLs and higher mortality rates after traumatic cervical spine injuries in elderly patients.","['cervical spine injury', 'complications', 'dementia', 'functional

16877190","Nursing home crowding and its association with outbreak-associated respiratory infection in Ontario, Canada before the COVID-19 pandemic (2014-19): a retrospective cohort study.","Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that crowding in nursing homes is associated with high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, but this effect has not been shown for other respiratory pathogens. We aimed to measure the association between crowding in nursing homes and outbreak-associated respiratory infection incidence and related mortality before the COVID-19 pandemic.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of nursing homes in Ontario, Canada. We identified, characterised, and selected nursing homes through the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care datasets. Nursing homes that were not funded by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care and homes that closed before January, 2020 were excluded. Outcomes consisting of respiratory infection outbreaks were obtained from the Integrated Public Health Information System of Ontario. The crowding index equalled the mean number of residents per bedroom and bathroom. The primary outcomes were the incidence of outbreak-associated infections and mortality per 100 nursing home residents per year. We examined the incidence of infections and deaths as a function of the crowding index by use of negative binomial regression with adjustment for three home characteristics (ie, ownership, number of beds, and region) and nine mean resident characteristics (ie, age, female sex, dementia, diabetes, chronic heart failure, renal failure, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and activities of daily living score).
Between Sept 1, 2014, and Aug 31, 2019, 5107 respiratory infection outbreaks in 588 nursing homes were recorded, of which 4921 (96·4%), involving 64 829 cases of respiratory infection and 1969 deaths, were included in this analysis. Nursing homes with a high crowding index had higher incidences of respiratory infection (26·4% vs 13·8%; adjusted rate ratio per one resident per room increase in crowding 1·89 [95% CI 1·64-2·17]) and mortality (0·8% vs 0·4%; 2·34 [1·88-2·92]) than did homes with a low crowding index.
Respiratory infection and mortality rates were higher in nursing homes with high crowding index than in homes with low crowding index, and the association was consistent across various respiratory pathogens. Decreasing crowding is an important safety target beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to help to promote resident wellbeing and decrease the transmission of prevalent respiratory pathogens.

At the study institution, this population with any ""suspicion of trauma"" criteria were previously triaged as a trauma team activation (TTA) but due to high rates of mis-triage was modified to ""signs of trauma."" The purpose of this study is to compare injured and uninjured FD patients to identify patient characteristics and outcomes, and to evaluate triage accuracy of signs of trauma.
A single-center retrospective review was conducted on adult patients who were FD between 1/2019 and 4/2021. Based on injury severity score (ISS), FD patients were categorized as injured or uninjured and these groups were compared. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for signs and suspicion of trauma as triage criteria, where 
415 FD patients were identified with 273 (65.8%) sustaining injury and 142 (34.2%) uninjured. There were no differences in age, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, or vital signs. 
Injured and uninjured FD trauma patients had similar characteristics on arrival including GCS and vitals, emphasizing the challenge of identifying patients with injury requiring trauma evaluation.

20818472",US Adults' Likelihood to Participate in Dementia Prevention Drug Trials: Results from the National Poll on Healthy Aging.,"Recruitment to dementia prevention clinical trials is challenging, and participants are not representative of US adults at risk. A better understanding of the general public's interest in dementia prevention research participation is needed to inform future recruitment strategies.
To examine US adults' characteristics associated with self-reported likelihood to participate in dementia prevention clinical trials.
We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the October 2018 wave of the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging.
The National Poll on Healthy Aging is a nationally representative survey of adults using KnowledgePanel (Ipsos Public Affairs LLC), a probability-based panel of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.
We analyzed data from 1,028 respondents, ages 50 to 64 years, who completed a web survey module on brain health.
We used logistic regression models to examine associations between sociodemographic and dementia-related factors (e.g., family history) and self-reported likelihood to participate in a dementia prevention clinical trial of a new medicine (""very"" or ""somewhat likely"" vs. ""not likely"" survey responses). Among respondents not likely to participate, we examined frequency of reasons endorsed for this decision, stratified by age, sex, and race and ethnicity.
Of the 1,028 respondents, half were female, 68% Non-Hispanic White, 13% Hispanic, and 12% Non-Hispanic Black. Twelve percent of respondents reported being very likely to participate in a dementia prevention trial, 32% somewhat likely, and 56% not likely. Factors associated with higher likelihood to participate were higher perceived risk of dementia [OR, 2.17 (95% CI, 1.61, 2.93)], a positive family history of dementia [OR, 1.75 (95% CI, 1.27, 2.43)], and having discussed dementia prevention with a doctor [OR, 2.20 (95% CI, 1.10, 4.42)]. There were no differences in likelihood to participate by sociodemographic characteristics. Among 570 respondents not likely to participate, 39% said they did not want to be a guinea pig, 23% thought dementia would not affect them, 22% thought there would be too high a chance for harm, 15% indicated study participation would take too much time, and 5% reported fear of learning information about oneself. There were no differences across age, sex, and racial and ethnic groups.
In this study, perceived risk of dementia, family history, and discussion of prevention with a doctor were associated with likelihood to participate in a dementia prevention clinical trial, whereas sociodemographic factors including race and ethnicity were not. Findings suggest that recruitment interventions focused on increasing knowledge of dementia risk and prevention trials and involving healthcare providers may be effective tools to improve enrollment rates, regardless of target community.","['Prevention', 'clinical trials', 'recruitment']",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2023-01-16,"[{'lastname': 'Cox', 'firstname': 'C G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Chelsea G.

7932084",Cognitive Aging in Same- and Different-Sex Relationships: Comparing Age of Diagnosis and Rate of Cognitive Decline in the Health and Retirement Study.,"The ongoing marginalization of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people has been hypothesized to produce poorer late-in-life cognitive outcomes, according to mechanisms posited by minority stress and allostatic load theories. Yet the existence of those outcomes remains understudied, and results of existing studies have been contradictory. Using a population-based longitudinal aging study, this paper will compare age at diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or a related dementia and rates of cognitive decline between participants in same-sex relationships (SSRs) and different-sex relationships (DSRs).
The study used longitudinal cognitive-health data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; 1998-2018; N = 26,344) to analyze the onset of cognitive impairment and AD/dementia and the rates of cognitive change between participants in SSRs and those in DSRs. We hypothesized that SSR participants would have worse overall cognitive functioning in old age and would experience earlier onset of cognitive impairment. Using multiple regression, we compared the ages at which participants in SSRs and DSRs first reported AD or dementia diagnoses and the ages at which they first scored below cutoffs for cognitive impairment, not dementia (CIND) and possible dementia as determined using the cognitive assessment. The study then compared rates of cognitive decline over time across the SSR and DSR groups, including stratified analyses by education, race/ethnicity, wealth, and sex/gender.
Participants in SSRs reported dementia diagnoses (β = -12.346; p = 0.001), crossed the threshold into CIND (β = -8.815; p < 0.001) and possible dementia (β = -13.388; p < 0.001) at a younger age than participants in DSRs. When adjusted for covariates, participants in SSRs also had lower cognition at baseline (β = 0.745; p = 0.003), though having slower rates of cognitive decline when SSR was interacted with time (β = 0.066; p = 0.003). In separate analyses, cognitive differences for SSR participants were only found in participants without undergraduate degrees, with below-median household incomes, and women.
Our findings support theories suggesting that marginalization and stigma cause premature cognitive impairment. Findings also suggest that higher education might mitigate the adverse effects of sexuality-minority status on cognitive aging. Results do not support these theories' claims of more rapid cognitive decline; the lower slopes of cognitive decline with time are compatible with the possibility of slower rates of decline for aging individuals in SSRs.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Bisexual', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Gay', 'Lesbian', 'Same-sex relationships', 'Sexual orientation']",Gerontology,2022-12-13,"[{'lastname': 'Hanes', 'firstname': 'Douglas William', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Program in Public Health, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, New York, USA.\nCentre for Sexual and Gender Minority Health, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Clouston', 'firstname': 'Sean A P', 'initials': 'SAP', 'affiliation': 'Program in Public Health, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, New York, USA.\nDepartment of Family, Population, and Preventive Medicine, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, New York, USA.'}]",,Our findings support theories suggesting that marginalization and stigma cause premature cognitive impairment.

Comparative real-world analyses demonstrating its benefits are needed.
To evaluate health care resource utilization (HCRU) outcomes among PDP patients treated with PIM vs. other-AAPs.
Retrospective cohort analysis of Parts A, B, and D claims from 100% Medicare sample from 01 January 2013-31 December 2019 was conducted. PDP Patients initiating (i.e. index date) continuous monotherapy (PIM vs. other-AAPs) for ≥12-months during 01 January 2014-31 December 2018 without 12-months pre-index AAP use were selected after 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) on 31 variables (sex, race, region, age, and 27 Elixhauser comorbidities). HCRU outcomes included: annual all-cause and psychiatric hospitalization (short-term stay, long-term stay, and SNF-stay [skilled nursing facility]) rates, annual all-cause and psychiatric-ER visit rates, mean per-patient-per-year (PPPY) hospitalizations, and average length of stay (ALOS). PIM and other-AAPs were compared using generalized linear models (GLM) controlled for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, coexisting-dementia, and coexisting insomnia.

36012696",Comorbidities and Outcomes among Females with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Compared to Males.,"Sex-based medicine is an important emerging discipline within medicine. We investigated the clinical characteristics, complications, and outcomes of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in females compared to males. Demographics, comorbidities, malignancy, complications, outcomes, and all-cause mortality of NAFLD patients older than 18 years were analyzed. The data were extracted using the MDClone platform from “Clalit” in Israel. A total of 111,993 (52.8%) of the study subjects were females with an average age of 44.4 ± 14.7 years compared to 39.62 ± 14.9 years in males, p < 0.001. Significantly higher rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dementia, and thyroid cancer and lower rates of ischemic heart disease (22.3% vs. 27.3%, p < 0.001) were found among females. Females had a higher rate of cirrhosis, 2.3% vs. 1.9%, p < 0.001, and a lower rate of hepatocellular carcinoma, 0.4% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001. In the multivariate analysis, a relationship between age, diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis development were found among males and females. A lower age-adjusted mortality rate was found among females, 94.5/1000 vs. 116/1000 among males. In conclusion, older age at diagnosis, higher rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cirrhosis, and a lower age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate were found among females with NAFLD.","['cirrhosis', 'fatty liver', 'females', 'gender', 'liver']",Biomedicines,2022-11-27,"[{'lastname': 'Abu-Freha', 'firstname': 'Naim', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'The Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.\nThe Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Cohen', 'firstname': 'Bracha', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Soroka Clinical Research Center, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Weissmann', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.\nSoroka Clinical Research Center, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Hizkiya', 'firstname': 'Reut', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'The Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.\nInternal Medicine Division, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Abu-Hammad', 'firstname': 'Reem', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'The Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Taha', 'firstname': 'Gadeer', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa 31096, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Gordon', 'firstname': 'Michal', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Soroka Clinical Research Center, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva 84101, Israel.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/biomedicines10112908

28,36404544,Sex-Specific Heterogeneity of Mild Cognitive Impairment Identified Based on Multi-Modal Data Analysis.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is heterogeneous with different rates and risks of progression to AD. There are significant gender disparities in the susceptibility, prognosis, and outcomes in patients with MCI, with female being disproportionately negatively impacted.
The aim of this study was to identify sex-specific heterogeneity of MCI using multi-modality data and examine the differences in the respective MCI subtypes with different prognostic outcomes or different risks for MCI to AD conversion.
A total of 325 MCI subjects (146 women, 179 men) and 30 relevant features were considered. Mixed-data clustering was applied to women and men separately to discover gender-specific MCI subtypes. Gender differences were compared in the respective subtypes of MCI by examining their MCI to AD disease prognosis, descriptive statistics, and conversion rates.
We identified three MCI subtypes: poor-, good-, and best-prognosis for women and for men, separately. The subtype-wise comparison (for example, poor-prognosis subtype in women versus poor-prognosis subtype in men) showed significantly different means for brain volumetric, cognitive test-related, also for the proportion of comorbidities. Also, there were substantial gender differences in the proportions of participants who reverted to normal function, remained stable, or converted to AD.
Analyzing sex-specific heterogeneity of MCI offers the opportunity to advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of both MCI and AD, allows stratification of risk in clinical trials of interventions, and suggests gender-based early intervention with targeted treatment for patients at risk of developing AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'comorbidity', 'gender differences', 'heterogeneity', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'subtypes']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-11-22,"[{'lastname': 'Katabathula', 'firstname': 'Sreevani', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Pamela B', 'initials': 'PB', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Health Integration, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Rong', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,"Analyzing sex-specific heterogeneity of MCI offers the opportunity to advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of both MCI and AD, allows stratification of risk in clinical trials of interventions, and suggests gender-based early intervention with targeted treatment for patients at risk of developing AD.","We identified three MCI subtypes: poor-, good-, and best-prognosis for women and for men, separately.

25635277",Effect of Comorbidities on the Infection Rate and Severity of COVID-19: Nationwide Cohort Study With Propensity Score Matching.,"A vaccine against COVID-19 has been developed; however, COVID-19 transmission continues. Although there have been many studies of comorbidities that have important roles in COVID-19, some studies have reported contradictory results.
This study was conducted using real-world data from COVID-19 patients in South Korea and aimed to investigate the impact of patient demographics and comorbidities on the infection rate and severity of COVID-19.
Data were derived from a nationwide South Korean COVID-19 cohort study with propensity score (PS) matching. We included infected individuals who were COVID-19-positive between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and PS-matched uninfected controls. PS matching was performed to balance the baseline characteristics of each comorbidity and to adjust for potential confounders, such as age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, medication, and other comorbidities, that were matched with binary variables. The outcomes were the confirmed comorbidities affecting the infection rate and severity of COVID-19. The endpoints were COVID-19 positivity and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (such as tracheostomy, continuous renal replacement therapy, intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death).
The COVID-19 cohort with PS matching included 8070 individuals with positive COVID-19 test results and 8070 matched controls. The proportions of patients in the severe group were higher for individuals 60 years or older (severe clinical outcomes for those 60 years or older, 16.52%; severe clinical outcomes for those of other ages, 2.12%), those insured with Medicaid (Medicaid, 10.81%; other insurance, 5.61%), and those with disabilities (with disabilities, 18.26%; without disabilities, 5.07%). The COVID-19 infection rate was high for patients with pulmonary disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.88; 95% CI 1.70-2.03), dementia (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.40-2.20), gastrointestinal disease (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.62-1.88), stroke (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.23-2.27), hepatobiliary disease (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.19-1.44), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.16-1.43), and cardiovascular disease (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07-1.35). In contrast, it was lower for individuals with hyperlipidemia (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.67-0.80), autoimmune disease (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.89), and cancer (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62-0.86). The severity of COVID-19 was high for individuals with kidney disease (OR 5.59; 95% CI 2.48-12.63), hypertension (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.91-4.47), dementia (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.91-4.47), cancer (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.15-2.94), pulmonary disease (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.35-2.19), cardiovascular disease (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.17-2.04), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.87), and psychotic disorders (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01-6.52). However, it was low for those with hyperlipidemia (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.60-1.00).
Upon PS matching considering the use of statins, it was concluded that people with hyperlipidemia could have lower infection rates and disease severity of COVID-19.","['COVID-19', 'comorbidity', 'hyperlipidemia', 'infection rate', 'severity of illness index']",JMIR public health and surveillance,2022-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jiyong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Inje University Ilsanpaik Hospital, Goyang, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Seong Hun', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Statistical analysis company, HYMS, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jong Moon', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.\nDepartment of Medical Informatics Big Data Center, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.'}]",,,"The COVID-19 cohort with PS matching included 8070 individuals with positive COVID-19 test results and 8070 matched controls.

35837967",Population-Based Estimates of 1-Year Mortality After Major Surgery Among Community-Living Older US Adults.,"Despite their importance to guiding public health decision-making and policies and to establishing programs aimed at improving surgical care, contemporary nationally representative mortality data for geriatric surgery are lacking.
To calculate population-based estimates of mortality after major surgery in community-living older US adults and to determine how these estimates differ according to key demographic, surgical, and geriatric characteristics.
Prospective longitudinal cohort study with 1 year of follow-up in the continental US from 2011 to 2018. Participants included 5590 community-living fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, aged 65 years or older, from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). Data analysis was conducted from February 22, 2021, to March 16, 2022.
Major surgeries and mortality over 1 year were identified through linkages with data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Data on frailty and dementia were obtained from the annual NHATS assessments.
From 2011 to 2017, of the 1193 major surgeries (from 992 community-living participants), the mean (SD) age was 79.2 (7.1) years; 665 were women (55.7%), and 30 were Hispanic (2.5%), 198 non-Hispanic Black (16.6%), and 915 non-Hispanic White (76.7%). Over the 1-year follow-up period, there were 206 deaths representing 872 096 survey-weighted deaths and 13.4% (95% CI, 10.9%-15.9%) mortality. Mortality rates were 7.4% (95% CI, 4.9%-9.9%) for elective surgeries and 22.3% (95% CI, 17.4%-27.1%) for nonelective surgeries. For geriatric subgroups, 1-year mortality was 6.0% (95% CI, 2.6%-9.4%) for persons who were nonfrail, 27.8% (95% CI, 21.2%-34.3%) for those who were frail, 11.6% (95% CI, 8.8%-14.4%) for persons without dementia, and 32.7% (95% CI, 24.3%-41.0%) for those with probable dementia. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios for 1-year mortality were 4.41 (95% CI, 2.53-7.69) for frailty with a reduction in restricted mean survival time of 48.8 days and 2.18 (95% CI, 1.40-3.40) for probable dementia with a reduction in restricted mean survival time of 44.9 days.
In this study, the population-based estimate of 1-year mortality after major surgery among community-living older adults in the US was 13.4% but was 3-fold higher for nonelective than elective procedures. Mortality was considerably elevated among older persons who were frail or who had probable dementia, highlighting the potential prognostic value of geriatric conditions after major surgery.",[],JAMA surgery,2022-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Gill', 'firstname': 'Thomas M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'lastname': 'Vander Wyk', 'firstname': 'Brent', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'lastname': 'Leo-Summers', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'Terrence E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'lastname': 'Becher', 'firstname': 'Robert D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.'}]",,,"From 2011 to 2017, of the 1193 major surgeries (from 992 community-living participants), the mean (SD) age was 79.2 (7.1) years; 665 were women (55.7%), and 30 were Hispanic (2.5%), 198 non-Hispanic Black (16.6%), and 915 non-Hispanic White (76.7%).

31,36241548,The effect of occupation on the incidence of vascular dementia: A 12-year follow-up cohort study.,"Vascular dementia (DV) is the second cause of dementia with 15.8-20% of cases. Previous studies of the effect of occupation in DV do not show conclusive results, therefore, the objective was to analyze if the type of occupation can vary the risk of developing DV in those older than 55 years.
In the ZARADEMP project, a community sample of 4,803 individuals were followed longitudinally in four waves. The occupation was classified following the National Classification of Occupations (CNO-11) and the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08). Different standardized instruments were used: the medical and psychiatric histories (History and Aetiology Schedule) and other risk factors (Mini-Mental Status Examination, Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT). For this study, we calculated incidence rates, incidence rate ratios and hazard ratios in multivariate Cox regression models, stratified by gender. For this study, we included 3,883 participants.
In women, the risk of DV was doubled in Blue-collar workers, with a moderate effect (Cohen's d=0.54) and multiplying by 2.7 in Homeworks respect to White Collar with a moderate effect (Cohen's d=0.77), although they did not reach statistical significance. We did not observe the effect of occupation on the risk of DV in men.
We have found a moderate but non-significant effect between occupation and DV risk in women. We found no effect of occupation on the risk of VD in males while other clinical factors (age, diabetes or body mass index) presented a clearer effect than the occupation.","['Demencia vascular', 'Diferencias de género', 'Epidemiology', 'Epidemiología', 'Factor de riesgo', 'Gender differences', 'Occupation', 'Ocupación', 'Risk factor', 'Vascular dementia']",Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental,2022-10-15,"[{'lastname': 'Gracia-Rebled', 'firstname': 'Ana Cristina', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Fisiatría y Enfermería, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.

31862783",Longitudinal Patterns of Cortical Atrophy on MRI in Patients With Alzheimer Disease With and Without Lewy Body Pathology.,"Although Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs) represent 2 different pathologies, they have clinical overlap, and there is a significant degree of co-occurrence of their neuropathologic findings. Many studies have examined imaging characteristics in clinically diagnosed patients; however, there is a relative lack of longitudinal studies that have studied patients with pathologic confirmation. We examined whether there were differences in longitudinal patterns of cortical atrophy between patients with both AD and DLB (AD/DLB) vs those with AD alone.
We collected and analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for patients who underwent autopsy. The rates of change in various neuropsychological assessments were not significantly different between patients with AD/DLB and AD, and each group had neuropsychological outcomes consistent with disease progression. For our neuroimaging analysis, we used a linear mixed-effects model to examine whether there were longitudinal differences in cortical rates of atrophy between patients with AD/DLB and AD.
Autopsies and serial neuroimaging were available on 48 patients (24 AD and 24 AD/DLB). Patients with AD alone had significantly higher atrophy rates in the left cuneus, lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions over time when compared with patients with concomitant DLB, after covarying for interval from imaging to autopsy, sex, and total estimated intracranial volume. Site ID was included as a random effect to account for site differences. For these regions, the rate of decline over time in the AD/DLB group was less steep by a difference of 0.1887, 0.395, and 0.0989, respectively (

Objective: To determine the characteristics and factors associated with mortality due to rare diseases in Chile from 2002 to 2017. Materials and methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study based on secondary mortality database from the Departamento de Estadística e Información en Salud (DEIS), Ministerio de Salud de Chile (Department of Statistics and Health Information, Chile Ministry of Health) from 2002 to 2017. The specific mortality rates adjusted by age and sex were calculated. A normality analysis was conducted using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In addition, a chi-square test of independence for associations and multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine the probability of death. Results: Between 2008 and 2012 there were 10,718 deaths due to rare diseases, 53.2% of them occurred among women. The average annual mortality rate was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants: 4.1 in women and 3.8 in men. The main causes of mortality among women were Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, anencephaly and autoinmune hepatitis, and among men, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, muscular dystrophy and anencephaly. Women are 1.75 times more likely to die than men (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.69 - 1.82). The highest probability of dying occurred among children aged 0-4 years (aOR = 15.30; 95% CI: 14.10 - 19.20). Conclusion: Overall, the burden of mortality due to rare disease was higher among women of all ages in Chile between 2002 and 2017.
Introducción. Las enfermedades huérfanas se caracterizan por su baja prevalencia, comúnmente son de evolución crónica, debilitantes y potencialmente mortales. Objetivo. Determinar las características y los factores asociados a la mortalidad por enfermedades huérfanas en Chile, entre 2002 y 2017. Materiales y métodos. Es un estudio transversal y analítico a partir de datos secundarios oficiales del Departamento de Estadística e Información en Salud (DEIS) del Ministerio de Salud de Chile. Se calcularon las tasas de mortalidad específica, y las ajustadas por sexo y edad. Se efectuó un análisis de normalidad mediante la prueba de Kolmogórov-Smirnov. Se aplicaron la prueba de ji al cuadrado de independencia para las asociaciones y el análisis de regresión logística multivariada para determinar la probabilidad de muerte. Resultados. Durante el periodo de estudio, 10.718 defunciones se atribuyeron a enfermedades huérfanas; 53,2 % ocurrieron en mujeres. La tasa media anual de mortalidad fue de 3,9 por 100.000 habitantes: 4,1 en mujeres y 3,8 en hombres. Las principales causas de muerte, en mujeres, fueron enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob, anencefalia, hepatitis autoinmunitaria y, en hombres, enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob, distrofia muscular y anencefalia. Las mujeres tienen 1,75 más veces la posibilidad de fallecer por este grupo de enfermedades en comparación con los hombres (OR ajustado=1,75; IC95% 1,69-1,82). La mayor probabilidad de morir se presentó en los menores de 0 a 4 años (OR ajustado=15,30; IC95% 14,10-19,20). Conclusión. En Chile, las mujeres constituyeron el grupo de población de mayor riesgo de morir por enfermedades huérfanas durante los años 2002 y 2017.

34744832",Perception of dignity in older men and women in the early stages of dementia: a cross-sectional study.,"Dementia is a serious problem in old age, that impacts an individual's ability to function and may threaten personal dignity. Given the variable features of the illness and the diversity of life experiences, many factors may contribute to the perception of dignity by men and women with dementia. The purpose of the study was to explore the factors that contribute to dignity and its domains in men and women with dementia.
This cross-sectional study involved 316 community-dwelling patients with early-stage dementia (aged ≥ 60) (PwD). We assessed the participants' sociodemographic and social involvement characteristics, health-related variables (pain, depression, physical performance, visual and hearing impairments), attitude to aging, and self-sufficiency in the activities of daily living (ADL). These factors were investigated as independent variables for the perception of dignity and of its domains in men and women.
Multivariate regression analysis showed that PwD experienced minor dignity problems in the early stages of dementia. In both men and women higher rates of depression, negative attitudes to aging, and pain were associated with reductions in the perception of dignity. In men, but not in women visual impairment had a negative effect on overall dignity, and on the associated domains of 'Loss of Autonomy' and 'Loss of Confidence'. In women, lowered self-sufficiency in ADL contributed to reduced self-perception of dignity and in the associated domains of 'Loss of Purpose of Life', 'Loss of Autonomy', and 'Loss of Confidence'. Sociodemographic and social involvement characteristics, hearing impairment, and physical performance did not influence the participants' self-perception of dignity.
The results suggested that several common factors (depression, attitudes to aging, and pain) contribute to the perception of dignity in both men and women. Other factors, visual impairments in men, and self-sufficiency in ADL in women, appear to be more gender specific. These differences might relate to their specific gender roles and experiences. The self-perception of dignity in PwD can be helped by supporting the individual, to the extent that their illness allows, in maintaining activities that are important to their gender roles, and that preserve their gender identity.

35,35799429,Sex Differences in Frailty Incidence in Greek Community-Dwelling Older People: The HELIAD Study.,"Previous frailty studies found higher prevalence of frailty in female than in male participants. This was mainly attributed to the fact that compared to men, women show increased longevity. Recent studies have reported that the observed difference between sexes applies irrespectively of the age of older people.
To provide data on sex differences in incident frailty by applying both phenotypic and multi-domain frailty measures in the same population of Greek community-dwelling older people.
Longitudinal study.
Data were drawn from the Hellenic longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD), a population-based, multidisciplinary study designed to estimate the prevalence and incidence of dementia in the Greek population.
1104 participants aged 65 year and above were included in this longitudinal study. This incidence cohort was re-evaluated after a mean follow-up period of 3.04±0.90 years.
Frailty was operationalized using 5 different definitions in the same population: the Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP) definition, the FRAIL Scale, the Frailty Index (FI), the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) and the Groningen Frailty Index (GFI). Frailty incidence was calculated a) for the whole sample, b) separately for men and women and c) after both age and sex stratification.
Age and sex stratification revealed that irrespective of age and frailty measurement, women showed higher incidence rates of frailty than men. Specifically, frailty seems to be a condition concerning women >65 years old, but when it comes to men, it is more frequent in those aged more than 75 years old. Finally, in relation to overall frailty incidence and comparing our results to previous studies, we detected a lower frailty incidence in the Greek population.
Differences between the two sexes indicate that when exploring the factors that are related to frailty, studies should provide data disaggregated for men and women.","['Sex differences', 'frailty', 'incidence', 'phenotypic and multi-domain measures']",The Journal of frailty & aging,2022-07-09,"[{'lastname': 'Geronikola', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Scarmeas Nikolaos, MD, PhD, Vasilisis Sofias 72, Athens, Athens, Greece, 115 28, Phone: + 30 2107289310, Fax: + 30 2107289310, Email: ns257@cumc.columbia.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Zalonis', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ntanasi', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Charisis', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kosmidis', 'firstname': 'M H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Anastasiou', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dardiotis', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hadjigeorgiou', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Megalou', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Velonakis', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Karavasilis', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gargalionis', 'firstname': 'A N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Patas', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Piperidi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chatzipanagiotou', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sakka', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Paraskevas', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yannakoulia', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Scarmeas', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Age and sex stratification revealed that irrespective of age and frailty measurement, women showed higher incidence rates of frailty than men.

31606366","Sex differences in plasma p-tau181 associations with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, cognitive decline, and clinical progression.","Studies have shown that women on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have more pathological tau in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), than men. Some studies have found that higher levels of tau biomarkers are more strongly associated with clinical AD, cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in women than in men. Despite major developments in the use of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) as an AD biomarker, it is unknown whether these sex differences apply to plasma p-tau181. In 1060 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (47% women, 73.8 ± 7.6 years old), we examined sex differences in plasma p-tau181 levels and their association with other biomarkers, cognitive decline and incident AD. Linear regressions tested for an effect of sex on plasma p-tau181 levels and for plasma p-tau181 × sex interactions on CSF p-tau181, as well as entorhinal cortex tau, cortical amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and brain glucose metabolism, quantified using PET imaging. Linear mixed effects models tested for a sex × baseline plasma p-tau181 interaction on change in cognition over time. Finally, Cox models tested for a sex × plasma p-tau181 interaction on the risk of AD dementia in participants who were free of dementia at baseline. Despite similar plasma p-tau181 levels between sexes, women had lower brain glucose metabolism, greater brain Aβ and entorhinal cortex tau deposition, higher CSF p-tau181 and faster cognitive decline in relation to higher baseline plasma p-tau181 levels compared with men. Among Aβ positive, dementia-free participants, women had higher rates of incident AD dementia associated with increasing baseline plasma p-tau181 levels, relative to men. Our results suggest that sex may impact the clinical interpretation of plasma p-tau181 concentrations. If replicated, these findings could have important implications for the use of plasma p-tau181 as an accessible AD biomarker and screening tool for preventive and therapeutic clinical trials.",[],Molecular psychiatry,2022-06-30,"[{'lastname': 'Tsiknia', 'firstname': 'Amaryllis A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Edland', 'firstname': 'Steven D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.\nDivision of Biostatistics, School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sundermann', 'firstname': 'Erin E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.\nResearch Service, Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, 92161, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Reas', 'firstname': 'Emilie T', 'initials': 'ET', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brewer', 'firstname': 'James B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Galasko', 'firstname': 'Douglas', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Banks', 'firstname': 'Sarah J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. sbanks@health.ucsd.edu.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. sbanks@health.ucsd.edu.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2022.

32692369",A national study of disenrollment from hospice among people with dementia.,"People with dementia (PWD) are at high risk for hospice disenrollment, yet little is known about patterns of disenrollment among the growing number of hospice enrollees with dementia.
Retrospective, observational cohort study of 100% Medicare beneficiaries with dementia aged 65 and older enrolled in the Medicare Hospice Benefit between July 2012 and December 2017. Outcome measures included hospice-initiated disenrollment for patients whose rate of decline ceased to meet the Medicare hospice eligibility guideline of ""expected death within 6 months"" (extended prognosis) and patient-initiated disenrollment (revocation). Hospice, regional, and patient risk factors and variation were assessed with multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models.
Among 867,695 hospice enrollees with dementia, 70,945 (8.2%) were disenrolled due to extended prognosis and 43,133 (5.0%) revoked within 1-year of their index admission. There was substantial variation in hospice provider disenrollment due to extended prognosis (10th-90th percentile 4.5%-14.6%, adjusted median odds ratio (MOR) 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82, 1.91) and revocation (10th-90th percentile 2.5%-10.1%, MOR 2.09, 95% CI 2.03, 2.14). Among hospital referral regions (HRR), there was more variation in revocation (10th-90th percentile 3.5%-7.6%, MOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.34, 1.47) than extended prognosis (10th-90th percentile 7.0%-9.5%, MOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.18, 1.27), with much higher revocation rates noted in HRRs located in the Southeast and Southern California. A number of patient and hospice characteristics were associated with higher odds of both types of disenrollment (younger age, female sex, minoritized race and ethnicity, Medicaid dual eligibility, Medicare Part C enrollment), while some were associated with revocation only (more comorbidities, newer, smaller, and for-profit hospices).
In this nationally representative study of hospice enrollees with dementia, hospice disenrollment varied by type of hospice, geographic region, and patient characteristics including age, sex, race, and ethnicity. These findings raise important questions about whether and how the Medicare Hospice Benefit could be adapted to reduce disparities and better support PWD.","['dementia', 'disenrollment', 'hospice']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2022-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Hunt', 'firstname': 'Lauren J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiological Nursing, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.\nGlobal Brain Health Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.\nPhilip R.

19690313",Development of a data-driven case-mix adjustment model for comparison of hospital performance in hip fracture care.,"To compare hospitals' hip fracture patient mortality in a quality of care registry, correction for patient characteristics is needed. This study evaluates in 39,374 patients which characteristics are associated with 30 and 90-day mortality, and showed how using these characteristics in a case mix-model changes hospital comparisons within the Netherlands.
Mortality rates after hip fracture surgery are considerable and may be influenced by patient characteristics. This study aims to evaluate hospital variation regarding patient demographics and disease burden, to develop a case-mix adjustment model to analyse differences in hip fracture patients' mortality to calculate case-mix adjusted hospital-specific mortality rates.
Data were derived from 64 hospitals participating in the Dutch Hip Fracture Audit (DHFA). Adult hip fracture patients registered in 2017-2019 were included. Variation of case-mix factors between hospitals was analysed, and the association between case-mix factors and mortality at 30 and 90 days was determined through regression models.
There were 39,374 patients included. Significant variation in case-mix factors amongst hospitals was found for age ≥ 80 (range 25.8-72.1% p < 0.001), male gender (12.0-52.9% p < 0.001), nursing home residents (42.0-57.9% p < 0.001), pre-fracture mobility aid use (9.9-86.7% p < 0,001), daily living dependency (27.5-96.5% p < 0,001), ASA-class ≥ 3 (25.8-83.3% p < 0.001), dementia (3.6-28.6% p < 0.001), osteoporosis (0.0-57.1% p < 0.001), risk of malnutrition (0.0-29.2% p < 0.001) and fracture types (all p < 0.001). All factors were associated with 30- and 90-day mortality. Eight hospitals showed higher and six showed lower 30-day mortality than expected based on their case-mix. Six hospitals showed higher and seven lower 90-day mortality than expected. The specific outlier hospitals changed when correcting for case-mix factors.
Dutch hospitals show significant case-mix variation regarding hip fracture patients. Case-mix adjustment is a prerequisite when comparing hospitals' 30-day and 90-day hip fracture patients' mortality. Adjusted mortality may serve as a starting point for improving hip fracture care.","['Case-mix correction', 'Case-mix factors', 'Confounders', 'Database', 'Hip fractures', 'Hospital comparison', 'Mortality', 'Outcomes', 'Quality of care', 'Registry']",Archives of osteoporosis,2022-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Würdemann', 'firstname': 'Franka S', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': 'Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing, Scientific Bureau, Rijnsburgerweg 10, AA, 2333, Leiden, The Netherlands. f.s.wuerdemann@lumc.nl.\nDepartment of Traumasurgery, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden Albinusdreef 2, Leiden, 2333, ZA, The Netherlands. f.s.wuerdemann@lumc.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'Elfrink', 'firstname': 'Arthur K E', 'initials': 'AKE', 'affiliation': 'Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing, Scientific Bureau, Rijnsburgerweg 10, AA, 2333, Leiden, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Surgery, University Medical Center, Groningen Hanzeplein 1, GZ, 9713, Groningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilschut', 'firstname': 'Janneke A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing, Scientific Bureau, Rijnsburgerweg 10, AA, 2333, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van den Brand', 'firstname': 'Crispijn L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing, Scientific Bureau, Rijnsburgerweg 10, AA, 2333, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Schipper', 'firstname': 'Inger B', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Traumasurgery, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden Albinusdreef 2, Leiden, 2333, ZA, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hegeman', 'firstname': 'Johannes H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Traumasurgery, Ziekenhuisgroep Twente, Zilvermeeuw 1, Almelo, 7609, PP, The Netherlands.'}]",,,"There were 39,374 patients included.

34372587",Clinical features predicting COVID-19 mortality risk.,"Currently, the world is involved by a pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), which has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people so far. The consequences of infection with SARS-CoV-2 vary widely from asymptomatic to severe. Considering the increasing prevalence of different types of virus and acute infection with this disease, strategies to prevent mortality from COVID-19 should be seriously analyzed. In this study, the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were investigated in order to identify risk factors for mortality. Chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), COPD, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, increased D-dimer, male gender, old age, smoking and obesity are among the deadly risk factors associated COVID-19. Furthermore, lymphopenia and neutrophilia are often present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and the ratio of absolute neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) was significantly increased in patients without bacterial infection. These findings could be used in the future to control and prevent disease, because timely identification of patients with risk of COVID-19 is important to provide better treatment strategies for reduction of mortality.",[],European journal of translational myology,2022-04-16,"[{'lastname': 'Kouhpayeh', 'firstname': 'Hamidreza', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tropical and Infectious Diseases Department, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran; Zahedan University of Medical Sciences Research Center, Emam Ali Hospital, Zahedan. hkouhpayeh@yahoo.com.'}]",,,,,"10.4081/ejtm.2022.10268

33016914",Comparative Risk of Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementia Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Rheumatoid Arthritis Treated With Targeted Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Agents.,"Cytokine signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6, through the Janus-kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, was hypothesized to attenuate the risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the Drug Repurposing for Effective Alzheimer Medicines (DREAM) initiative based on multiomics phenotyping.
To evaluate the association between treatment with tofacitinib, tocilizumab, or TNF inhibitors compared with abatacept and risk of incident ADRD.
This cohort study was conducted among US Medicare fee-for-service patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 65 years and older from 2007 to 2017. Patients were categorized into 3 cohorts based on initiation of tofacitinib (a JAK inhibitor), tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor), or TNF inhibitors compared with a common comparator abatacept (a T-cell activation inhibitor). Analyses were conducted from August 2020 to August 2021.
The main outcome was onset of ADRD based on diagnosis codes evaluated in 4 alternative analysis schemes: (1) an as-treated follow-up approach, (2) an as-started follow-up approach incorporating a 6-month induction period, (3) incorporating a 6-month symptom to diagnosis period to account for misclassification of ADRD onset, and (4) identifying ADRD through symptomatic prescriptions and diagnosis codes. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated from Cox proportional hazard regression after adjustment for 79 preexposure characteristics through propensity score matching.
After 1:1 propensity score matching to patients using abatacept, a total of 22 569 propensity score-matched patient pairs, including 4224 tofacitinib pairs (mean [SD] age 72.19 [5.65] years; 6945 [82.2%] women), 6369 tocilizumab pairs (mean [SD] age 72.01 [5.46] years; 10 105 [79.4%] women), and 11 976 TNF inhibitor pairs (mean [SD] age 72.67 [5.91] years; 19 710 [82.3%] women), were assessed. Incidence rates of ADRD varied from 2 to 18 per 1000 person-years across analyses schemes. There were no statistically significant associations of ADRD with tofacitinib (analysis 1: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.55-1.51]; analysis 2: HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.53-1.13]; analysis 3: HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.72-2.33]; analysis 4: HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.21-1.20]), tocilizumab (analysis 1: HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.55-1.21]; analysis 2: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.81-1.35]; analysis 3: HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.75-1.96]; analysis 4: HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.44-1.39]), or TNF inhibitors (analysis 1: HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.72-1.20]; analysis 2: HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.86-1.20]; analysis 3: HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.86-1.48]; analysis 4: 0.90 [95% CI, 0.60-1.37]) compared with abatacept. Results from prespecified subgroup analysis by age, sex, and baseline cardiovascular disease were consistent except in patients with cardiovascular disease, for whom there was a potentially lower risk of ADRD with TNF inhibitors vs abatacept, but only in analyses 2 and 4 (analysis 1: HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.50-1.16]; analysis 2: HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.99]; analysis 3: HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.65-1.61]; analysis 4: HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.21-0.98]).

29396185",The Relationship Between Hearing and Mild Behavioral Impairment and the Influence of Sex: A Study of Older Adults Without Dementia from the COMPASS-ND Study.,"Hearing loss and mild behavioral impairment (MBI), both non-cognitive markers of dementia, can be early warning signs of incident cognitive decline.
We investigated the relationship between these markers and reported the influence of sex, using non-dementia participants (
Hearing was assessed with the 10-item Hearing Handicap for the Elderly-Screening (HHIE-S) questionnaire, a speech-in-noise test, screening audiometry, and hearing aid use. MBI symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Multivariable linear regressions examined the association between hearing and MBI symptom severity and multiple logistic regressions examined the association between hearing and MBI domains.
HHIE-S score was significantly associated with greater global MBI symptom burden, and symptoms in the apathy and affective dysregulation domains. Objective measures of audiometric hearing loss and speech-in-noise testing as well as hearing aid use were not associated with global MBI symptom severity or the presence of MBI domain-specific symptoms. Males were older, had more audiometric and speech-in-noise hearing loss, higher rates of hearing-aid use, and showed more MBI symptoms than females, especially apathy.
The HHIE-S, a subjective self-report measure that captures emotional and social aspects of hearing disability, was associated with informant-reported global MBI symptom burden, and more specifically the domains of affective dysregulation and apathy. These domains can be potential drivers of depression and social isolation. Hearing and behavior change can be assessed with non-invasive measures, adding value to a comprehensive dementia risk assessment.","['Aging', 'apathy', 'dementia', 'depression', 'hearing loss', 'neurobehavioral manifestations', 'sex characteristics']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports,2022-04-02,"[{'lastname': 'Gosselin', 'firstname': 'Penny', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Audiology & Children's Allied Health Services, Alberta Health Services, Lethbridge, AB, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Guan', 'firstname': 'Dylan X', 'initials': 'DX', 'affiliation': 'University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hung-Yu', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'Ron and Rene Ward Centre for Healthy Brain Aging Research, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pichora-Fuller', 'firstname': 'M Kathleen', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nSimon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Phillips', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Faris', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Statistical and Analytic Methods, Data and Analytics (DIMR), Foothills Medical Centre, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Eric E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Ron and Rene Ward Centre for Healthy Brain Aging Research, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.\nDepartments of Clinical Neurosciences and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ismail', 'firstname': 'Zahinoor', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Ron and Rene Ward Centre for Healthy Brain Aging Research, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.\nDepartments of Clinical Neurosciences and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, O'Brien Institute for Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.""}]",,"The HHIE-S, a subjective self-report measure that captures emotional and social aspects of hearing disability, was associated with informant-reported global MBI symptom burden, and more specifically the domains of affective dysregulation and apathy.

19286695",Effect of GBA gene variants on clinical characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies: a review and meta-analyses.,"Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene may be a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, due to the small number of existing studies and the small sample size of previous investigations, it is necessary to conduct objective and quantitative analyses of the association between GBA variants and DLB. There is no consensus regarding the relationship between GBA and the clinical characteristics of DLB. Therefore, we conducted multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a particular focus on the age of onset, sex, and cognitive impairment.
PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched to retrieve related studies. The odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated to determine the association between GBA and DLB and between GBA and the clinical characteristics of DLB.
Our meta-analysis confirmed that the GBA variant rate was significantly higher in the DLB group than in the control group, as were the variant rates of L444P, N370S, and E326K, whereas the variant rate of T369M showed no significant difference between the groups. Furthermore, the relevant literature was summarised again for meta-analyses. The GBA variant group had a younger age of onset and lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment score than the GBA non-variant group in DLB patients. GBA variants do not differ between sexes in DLB patients.
GBA variants increased the risk of DLB, especially N370S, E326K, and L444P which are strongly associated with DLB, but T369M was not. Patients harbouring GBA variants have an earlier age of onset, more severe cognitive impairment, and rapid symptom progression; however, sex is irrelevant in DLB.","['Dementia', 'Glucocerebrosidase', 'Lewy body disease', 'Meta-analysis']",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2022-03-26,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Jia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Quan', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Yidan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Qinghui', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Pei', 'firstname': 'Xiaochen', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'Hang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Jiajun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130000, Jilin, China. cjj@jlu.edu.cn.'}]",,,"Our meta-analysis confirmed that the GBA variant rate was significantly higher in the DLB group than in the control group, as were the variant rates of L444P, N370S, and E326K, whereas the variant rate of T369M showed no significant difference between the groups.

18657855",Prevalence of parkinsonism and Parkinson disease in urban and rural populations from Latin America: A community based study.,"Age and gender specific prevalence rates for parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD) are important to guide research, clinical practice, and public health planning; however, prevalence estimates in Latin America (LatAm) are limited. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of parkinsonism and PD and examine related risk factors in a cohort of elderly individuals from Latin America (LatAm).
Data from 11,613 adults (65+ years) who participated in a baseline assessment of the 10/66 study and lived in six LatAm countries were analyzed to estimate parkinsonism and PD prevalence. Crude and age-adjusted prevalence were determined by sex and country. Diagnosis of PD was established using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank's clinical criteria.
In this cohort, the prevalence of parkinsonism was 8.0% (95% CI 7.6%-8.5%), and the prevalence of PD was 2.0% (95% CI 1.7%-2.3%). PD prevalence increased with age from 1.0 to 3.5 (65-69vs. 80 years or older, 
The reported prevalence of PD in LatAm is similar to reports from high-income countries (HIC). A significant proportion of cases with PD did not have a previous diagnosis, nor did they seek any medical or neurological attention. These findings underscore the need to improve public health programs for populations currently undergoing rapid demographic aging and epidemiological transition.
The funding source had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.","['Latin America', ""Parkinson's disease"", 'Parkinsonism', 'Prevalence', 'Risk factors']",Lancet regional health.

16484637",Relationship of sex differences in cortical thickness and memory among cognitively healthy subjects and individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.,"An aging society has increased rates of late onset Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD), the most common form of age-related dementia. This neurodegenerative disease disproportionately affects women.
We use data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to examine sex differences in cortical thickness (CT) and memory performance. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to examine effects of sex and diagnosis (DX) on CT and verbal memory. For regions demonstrating significant interaction effects of sex and DX, we tested whether sex moderated cognition-thickness relationships. We used machine learning as a complementary method to explore multivariate CT differences between women and men.
Women demonstrated greater CT in many brain regions. More specifically, men showed relatively consistent CT declines in all stages, from normal control (NC) to ADD in the bilateral cingulate cortex, bilateral temporal regions, and left precuneus; women had more stable CT in these regions between NC and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages, but sharper declines from MCI to ADD. Similarly, for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), ANCOVA analyses showed that women had significantly better immediate and delayed recall scores than men, at NC and MCI stages, but greater differences, cross-sectionally, from MCI to ADD than men. We found significant sex moderation effects between RAVLT-immediate scores and CT of right isthmus-cingulate for all subjects across DX. Partial correlation analyses revealed that increased CT of right isthmus-cingulate was associated with better verbal learning in women, driven by positron emission tomography defined amyloid positive (Aβ+) subjects. Significant sex-moderation effects in cognition-thickness relationships were further found in the right middle-temporal, left precuneus, and left superior temporal regions in Aβ+ subjects. Using a machine learning approach, we investigated multivariate CT differences between women and men, showing an accuracy in classification of 75% for Aβ+ cognitively NC participants.
Sex differences in memory and CT can play a key role in the different vulnerability and progression of ADD in women compared to men. Machine learning indicates sex differences in CT are most relevant early in the ADD neurodegeneration.","['Alzheimer Disease Dementia', 'Cortical thickness', 'Machine learning', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Memory', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'RAVLT', 'Sex']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2022-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Cieri', 'firstname': 'Filippo', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhuang', 'firstname': 'Xiaowei', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, USA.\nInterdisciplinary Neuroscience Program, University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), Las Vegas, NV, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cordes', 'firstname': 'Dietmar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, USA.\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaplan', 'firstname': 'Nikki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cummings', 'firstname': 'Jeffery', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Chambers-Grundy Center for Transformative Neuroscience, Department of Brain Health, School of Integrated Health Sciences, University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), Las Vegas, NV, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Caldwell', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, USA. caldwej5@ccf.org.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Women demonstrated greater CT in many brain regions.

Significant sex-moderation effects in cognition-thickness relationships were further found in the right middle-temporal, left precuneus, and left superior temporal regions in Aβ+ subjects. Using a machine learning approach, we investigated multivariate CT differences between women and men, showing an accuracy in classification of 75% for Aβ+ cognitively NC participants.",© 2022.

30128552",Factors associated with hospital admission and severe outcomes for older patients with COVID-19.,"Morbidity and death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experienced by older adults in nursing homes have been well described, but COVID-19's impact on community-living older adults is less studied. Similarly, the previous ambulatory care experience of such patients has rarely been considered in studies of COVID-19 risks and outcomes.
To investigate the relationship of advanced age (65+), on risk factors associated with COVID-19 outcomes in community-living elders, we identified an electronic health records cohort of older patients aged 65+ with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with and without an ambulatory care visit in the past 24 months (n = 47,219) in the New York City (NYC) academic medical institutions and the NYC public hospital system from January 2020 to February 2021. The main outcomes are COVID-19 hospitalization; severe outcomes/Intensive care unit (ICU), intubation, dialysis, stroke, in-hospital death), and in-hospital death. The exposures include demographic characteristics, and those with ambulatory records, comorbidities, frailty, and laboratory results.
The 31,770 patients with an ambulatory history had a median age of 74 years; were 47.4% male, 24.3% non-Hispanic white, 23.3% non-Hispanic black, and 18.4% Hispanic. With increasing age, the odds ratios and attributable fractions of sex, race-ethnicity, comorbidities, and biomarkers decreased except for dementia and frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score). Patients without ambulatory care histories, compared to those with, had significantly higher adjusted rates of COVID-19 hospitalization and severe outcomes, with strongest effect in the oldest group.
In this cohort of community-dwelling older adults, we provided evidence of age-specific risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and severe outcomes. Future research should explore the impact of frailty and dementia in severe COVID-19 outcomes in community-living older adults, and the role of engagement in ambulatory care in mitigating severe disease.","['COVID-19', 'age-specific risk factors', 'ambulatory care', 'community-living older adults']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2022-02-19,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jiyu', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Blaum', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care, Department of Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.\nQuality Measurement and Research Group, National Center for Quality Assurance, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferris', 'firstname': 'Rosie', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care, Department of Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Arcila-Mesa', 'firstname': 'Mauricio', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care, Department of Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Do', 'firstname': 'Hyungrok', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pulgarin', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dolle', 'firstname': 'Johanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Office of Ambulatory Care and Population Health, NYC Health + Hospitals, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Scherer', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care, Department of Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.\nDivision of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalyanaraman Marcello', 'firstname': 'Roopa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Office of Ambulatory Care and Population Health, NYC Health + Hospitals, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhong', 'firstname': 'Judy', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}]",,,"The 31,770 patients with an ambulatory history had a median age of 74 years; were 47.4% male, 24.3% non-Hispanic white, 23.3% non-Hispanic black, and 18.4% Hispanic.

18790458",Prevalence of Constipation in Elderly and Its Association With Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Constipation and dementia have similar epidemiological characteristics. Changes in intestinal flora and characteristics of the brain-gut axis play roles in the pathogeneses of the two diseases, suggesting that there may be a close connection between the two. Most of the studies on constipation in dementia patients have focused on the population with α-synucleinopathies [Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)]. Few studies have reported the prevalence of constipation in all-cause dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) populations.
To assess the prevalence of constipation in patients with all-cause dementia and MCI subtypes and to explore the association between constipation with dementia and MCI subtypes.
From May 2019 to December 2019, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey. A total of 11,743 participants aged 65 or older from nine cities in China were surveyed. Participants underwent a series of clinical examinations and neuropsychological measurements. Constipation, dementia, MCI and MCI subtype were diagnosed according to established criteria through standard diagnostic procedures.
The overall age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of constipation in individuals aged 65 years and older was 14.8% (95% CI, 14.6-15.0). The prevalence rates of constipation were19.2% (95% CI, 17.3-21.0), 19.1% (95% CI, 16.8-21.5), 14.4% (95% CI, 12.8-15.9), and 13.8% (95% CI, 13.0-14.6) in the dementia, non-amnestic (na)-MCI, amnestic (a)-MCI and normal cognition populations, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher prevalence of constipation was associated with dementia (
The present study found a high prevalence of constipation in elderly individuals in China, and higher in patients with dementia and na-MCI.","['Chinese elderly', 'constipation', 'dementia', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'prevalence']",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022-02-11,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Fei', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Clinical College of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neurorehabilitation, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Neurology, Yuncheng Central Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Yuncheng, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fei', 'firstname': 'Min', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical College of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neurorehabilitation, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Neurology, Yuncheng Central Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Yuncheng, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Wen-Zheng', 'initials': 'WZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Dan', 'initials': 'XD', 'affiliation': 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Department of Neurology, Tianjin Dementia Institute, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Shuai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Department of Neurology, Tianjin Dementia Institute, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Jin-Hong', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Cangzhou People's Hospital, Cangzhou, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lv', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Niu', 'firstname': 'Jian-Ping', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College, Xiamen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Meng', 'firstname': 'Xin-Ling', 'initials': 'XL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Pan', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Dementia Clinic, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, The First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gang', 'firstname': 'Bao-Zhi', 'initials': 'BZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'You', 'firstname': 'Yong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lv', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Hainan General Hospital, Haikou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ji', 'firstname': 'Yong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical College of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neurorehabilitation, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases, Beijing, China.\nTianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Department of Neurology, Tianjin Dementia Institute, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.'}]",,"The present study found a high prevalence of constipation in elderly individuals in China, and higher in patients with dementia and na-MCI.","The overall age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of constipation in individuals aged 65 years and older was 14.8% (95% CI, 14.6-15.0).

32848093",Sex Differences in the Risk of Dementia in Older Veterans.,"Studies have demonstrated women to have a higher prevalence of dementia compared to men. However, sex differences in dementia incidence are controversial with conflicting reports showing women with higher, lower, or similar incidence. Source of difference may be due to clinical setting and lack of consideration of competing risk of death. We examined dementia incidence in a sample of the national Veteran population to determine differences by sex.
We examined data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated health care system in the United States. We studied 947 797 Veterans aged ≥55 years (mean age: 69.9 ± 8.4, 3% female) evaluated in the VHA from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2019. We estimated age-adjusted incidence rates of dementia (International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Edition codes) by sex, and used Fine-Gray proportional hazards models with age as time scale to examine time to diagnosis, accounting for competing risk of death.
During the follow-up (mean 8.4 years), 11.3% (n = 106 977, 11.4% men and 8.0% women) of Veterans developed dementia. Age-adjusted incidence was 12.6/1 000 person-years for men and 12.7/1 000 person-years for women. Compared to male Veterans, risk dementia was slightly higher among females (hazard ratio = 1.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.20), and on average, female Veterans developed dementia 0.2 years earlier than male Veterans. After additional adjustment for race, education, medical, and psychiatric conditions, results were similar.
Among older Veterans in a national cohort, women had a slightly increased risk for developing dementia compared to men after accounting for competing risk of death.","['Dementia', 'Dementia incidence', 'Dementia prevalence', 'Gender', 'Sex', 'Veterans']","The journals of gerontology.

28069851",Incidence of potentially disruptive medical and social events in older adults with and without dementia.,"Potentially disruptive medical, surgical, and social events-such as pneumonia, hip fracture, and widowhood-may accelerate the trajectory of decline and impact caregiving needs in older adults, especially among people with dementia (PWD). Prior research has focused primarily on nursing home residents with dementia. We sought to assess the incidence of potentially disruptive events in community-dwelling people with and without dementia.
Retrospective cohort study of participants aged 65+ enrolled in the Health and Retirement Study between 2010 and 2018 (n = 9346), including a subset who were married-partnered at baseline (n = 5105). Dementia was defined with a previously validated algorithm. We calculated age-adjusted and gender-stratified incidence per 1000 person-years and incidence rate ratios of: 1) hospitalization for pneumonia, 2) hip fracture, and 3) widowhood in people with and without dementia.
PWD (n = 596) were older (mean age 84 vs. 75) and a higher proportion were female (67% vs. 57%) than people without dementia (PWoD) (n = 8750). Age-adjusted incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) of pneumonia were higher in PWD (113.1; 95% CI 94.3, 131.9) compared to PWoD (62.1; 95% CI 54.7, 69.5), as were hip fractures (12.3; 95% CI 9.1, 15.6 for PWD compared to 8.1; 95% CI 6.9, 9.2 in PWoD). Point estimates of widowhood incidence were slightly higher for PWD (25.3; 95% CI 20.1, 30.5) compared to PWoD (21.9; 95% CI 20.3, 23.5), but differences were not statistically significant. The association of dementia with hip fracture-but not pneumonia or widowhood-was modified by gender (male incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.24, 95% CI 1.34, 3.75 versus female IRR 1.31 95% CI 0.92,1.86); interaction term p = 0.02).
Compared to PWoD, community-dwelling PWD had higher rates of pneumonia and hip fracture, but not widowhood. Knowing how often PWD experience these events can aid in anticipatory guidance and care planning for this growing population.","['dementia', 'hip fracture', 'pneumonia', 'widowhood']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2022-02-06,"[{'lastname': 'Hunt', 'firstname': 'Lauren J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiological Nursing, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.\nGlobal Brain Health Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Morrison', 'firstname': 'R Sean', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.\nJames J.

32809033",Mortality by COVID-19 Before Vaccination - One Year Experience of Hospitalized Patients in Madrid.,"The aim of the study was to analyze the mortality and characteristics of deceased patients with COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic.
All admissions owing to COVID-19 at a tertiary hospital in Madrid were analyzed. Three waves were considered: March 2020 to June 2020, July 2020 to November 2020, and December 2020 to April 2021.
A total of 3,676 patients were identified. Among inpatients, no differences regarding age, sex, length of admission, or mortality were found between the 3 waves (p >0.05). The overall mortality rate was 12.9%. Among deceased patients, the median age was 82 years and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 6. Considering the main predictors for mortality by COVID-19 (age, sex, and concomitant comorbidities), only patients with previous lung disease were more prevalent in the third period (p <0.01). Finally, higher intensive care unit admission rates, a lower rate of patients coming from nursing homes, and a lower rate of patients with dementia were noted in the third period (p <0.05) among deceased patients.
One year after the onset of the pandemic, the mortality rate of hospitalized patients and the profile of non-survivors have not changed significantly. In the absence of vaccine benefits, advanced age and multiple pathologies are uniform characteristics of non-survivors.","['COVID-19', 'Spain', 'comorbidities', 'mortality rate']",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2022-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Moreno-Torres', 'firstname': 'Víctor', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.

28550245",Poor sleep accelerates hippocampal and posterior cingulate volume loss in cognitively normal healthy older adults.,"Poor sleep quality is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. This longitudinal imaging study aimed to determine the acceleration in the rates of tissue loss in cognitively critical brain regions due to poor sleep in healthy elderly individuals. Cognitively-normal healthy individuals, aged ≥60 years, reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and underwent baseline and 2-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. The links between self-reported sleep quality, rates of tissue loss in cognitively-critical brain regions, and white matter hyperintensity load were assessed. A total of 48 subjects were classified into normal (n = 23; PSQI score <5) and poor sleepers (n = 25; PSQI score ≥5). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of age, gender, years of education, ethnicity, handedness, body mass index, and cognitive performance. Compared to normal sleepers, poor sleepers exhibited much faster rates of volume loss, over threefold in the right hippocampus and fivefold in the right posterior cingulate over 2 years. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the rates of volume loss in the cerebral and cerebellar grey and white matter between the two groups. Rates of volume loss in the right posterior cingulate were negatively associated with global PSQI scores. Poor sleep significantly accelerates volume loss in the right hippocampus and the right posterior cingulate cortex. These findings demonstrate that self-reported sleep quality explains inter-individual differences in the rates of volume loss in cognitively-critical brain regions in healthy older adults and provide a strong impetus to offer sleep interventions to cognitively normal older adults who are poor sleepers.","['hippocampus', 'longitudinal study', 'neurodegeneration', 'posterior cingulate cortex', 'sleep quality']",Journal of sleep research,2021-12-21,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Che', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Sang H', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Loewenstein', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Galvin', 'firstname': 'James E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Camargo', 'firstname': 'Christian J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alperin', 'firstname': 'Noam', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.'}]",,,,© 2021 European Sleep Research Society.,"10.1111/jsr.13538

30253139",Association of Physical Activity Level With Risk of Dementia in a Nationwide Cohort in Korea.,"Current guidelines recommend 500 to 999 metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week (MET-min/wk) of regular physical activity. However, evidence regarding the association between light-intensity physical activity (LPA) and dementia in older adults is inconsistent.
To assess the association between physical activity and new-onset dementia, focusing on the dose-response association between physical activity and dementia and the association of LPA with the incidence of dementia.
For this nationwide retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 62 286 participants aged 65 years or older without preexisting dementia who had available health checkup data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database from January 2009 to December 2012. Participants were followed up until December 31, 2013, and data analysis was performed from July 2020 to January 2021.
Physical activity level was assessed using a standardized, self-reported questionnaire at baseline. Physical activity-related energy expenditure (in MET-min/wk) was calculated by summing the product of frequency, intensity, and duration.
Incidence of dementia. Incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of events by the person-time at risk (presented as the incidence per 1000 person-years). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for dementia were analyzed according to physical activity level. Competing risk regression was performed by using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model, with mortality as the competing risk for dementia events. Multivariable regression models were constructed with adjustment for various patient characteristics. Incident dementia occurring 2 years after enrollment was assessed, and separate analyses included all follow-up periods. Restricted cubic spline curves were used to examine the association of continuous values of physical activity with dementia.
Among 62 286 participants, 60.4% were women, and the mean (SD) age was 73.2 (5.3) years. During a median follow-up of 42 months, 3757 participants (6.0%) developed dementia, and the overall incidence was 21.6 per 1000 person-years. Compared with inactive individuals (0 MET-min/wk), insufficiently active (1-499 MET-min/wk; mean, 284 MET-min/wk), active (500-999 MET-min/wk; mean, 675 MET-min/wk), and highly active participants (≥1000 MET-min/wk; mean, 1627 MET-min/wk) showed 10% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99), 20% (adjusted HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71-0.92), and 28% (adjusted HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.83) reduced dementia risk, respectively. Thus, a progressive decrease in the adjusted HR of dementia was associated with increasing physical activity level, and a restricted cubic spline curve showed that this association started with a low amount of total physical activity. This association was consistent regardless of age, sex, and other comorbidities or after censoring for stroke.

52,34855003,The impact of gender on clinical outcomes after sustaining a pelvic fracture.,"In trauma care, pelvic fractures contribute to morbidity and mortality. Since men and women have different pelvic structures and hormonal milieu, we studied if these gender differences affect clinical outcomes after pelvic fractures.
Using the 2016 American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (ACS TQIP) database, we stratified 24,425 patients with pelvic fractures by gender. Male and female patients were analyzed for differences in comorbidities,  mechanism of injury, complications, and other clinical parameters.
Female patients were older (p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities (p < 0.001), such as bleeding disorder, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, dementia, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Although female patients were sicker before sustaining pelvic fractures, male patients had higher rates of post-trauma complications (p < 0.001), such as acute kidney injury, deep vein thrombosis, unplanned admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and unplanned return to the operating room (OR). Multivariate logistic regression further supports this as male gender was independently associated with a 26.1% higher risk of developing at least one complication (p < 0.001), despite having a higher average Injury Severity Score (ISS) (21.91 ± 0.09 versus 20.71 ± 0.11, p < 0.001). Interestingly, male patients also had a longer hospital length of stay than female patients (13.36 ± 0.12 days versus 11.8 
Even though female patients were older and had more pre-existing comorbidities, male patients developed more complications and had longer hospital stays.

28978658",Characteristics of people with dementia lost to follow-up from a dementia care center.,"To identify the prevalence and characteristics of people living with dementia (PLWD) lost to follow-up (LTFU) from a specialized dementia care clinic and to understand factors influencing patient follow-up status.
We conducted a retrospective chart review of PLWD seen at a dementia care clinic 2012-2017 who were deceased as of 2018 (n = 746). Participants were evaluated for follow-up status at the time of death. Generalized linear regression was used to analyze demographic and diagnostic characteristics by follow-up status. Text extracted from participant medical records was analyzed using qualitative content analysis to identify reasons patients became LTFU.
Among PLWD seen at a dementia care clinic, 42% became LTFU before death, 39% of whom had chart documentation describing reasons for loss to follow-up. Increased rates of LTFU were associated with female sex (risk ratio 1.27, [95% confidence interval 1.09-1.49]; p = 0.003), educational attainment of high school or less (1.34, [1.13-1.61]; p = 0.001), and death in a long-term care facility (1.46, [1.19-1.80]; p = 0.003). Commonly documented reasons for not returning for care at the clinic included switching care to another provider (42%), logistical difficulty accessing care (26%), patient-family decision to discontinue care (24%), and functional challenges in accessing care (23%).
PLWD are LTFU from specialized memory care at high rates. Attention to care coordination, patient-provider communication, and integrated use of alternative care models such as telehealth are potential strategies to improve care.","['access to care', 'ambulatory', 'care coordination', 'continuity of care', 'dementia', 'end-of-life', 'lost to follow-up', 'memory care', 'mixed methods', 'outpatient']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2021-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Boyd', 'firstname': 'Nicole D', 'initials': 'ND', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Naasan', 'firstname': 'Georges', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'University of California San Francisco / Global Brain Health Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, Mount Sinai Hospitals, Ichan School of Medicine, New York City, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Harrison', 'firstname': 'Krista L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.\nUniversity of California San Francisco / Global Brain Health Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.\nPhilip R.

29240561",Examining racial disparities in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment.,"Black individuals are less likely to receive an accurate diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than their White counterparts, possibly because diagnoses are typically made by a physician, often without reference to objective neuropsychological test data. We examined racial differences in actuarial MCI diagnoses among individuals diagnosed with MCI via semi-structured clinical interview (the Clinical Dementia Rating) to examine for possible biases in the diagnostic process. Participants were drawn from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set and included 491 individuals self-identifying as Black and 2,818 individuals self-identifying as White. Chi-square tests were used to examine racial differences in rates of low scores for each cognitive test (domains assessed included attention, processing speed/executive functioning, memory, language, and visual skills). Next, we tested for racial differences in probability of meeting actuarial criteria for MCI by race. Compared to Black participants diagnosed with MCI via clinical interview, White individuals diagnosed with MCI via clinical interview demonstrated significantly higher rates of low demographically-adjusted ","['Cognition', 'diagnosis', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuropsychology', 'racial differences']",Applied neuropsychology.

A Comparison of the Years 2009, 2013 and 2018.","To assess changes in prevalence of malnutrition and its associated factors among people living in Dutch nursing homes in 2009, 2013 and 2018.
Secondary data analysis of the International Prevalence Measurement of Care Quality (LPZ) study.
Dutch nursing homes.
Residents living at a psychogeriatric or somatic ward in Dutch nursing homes in 2009, 2013 or 2018.
weight and height, unintentional weight loss over the last month and last six months, age, sex, length of stay up to the measurement day, care dependency, and the presence of various diseases (dementia, diabetes mellitus, stroke, diseases of the respiratory system, respiratory diseases and pressure ulcers).
In total, 14,317 residents were included in this study with a mean age of 82.2, 70.9 female and 66.8% was living on a psychogeriatric ward. Results of this study show relative stability in background characteristics of the nursing home population over the last decade. In the total sample, 16.7% was malnourished and these percentages were 16.6% in 2009, 17.5% in 2013 and 16.3% in 2018. Multiple binary logistic regression analyses revealed having a pressure ulcer, female sex and living on a psychogeriatric department to be positively associated and having diabetes mellitus to be negatively associated with malnutrition throughout the years. These associations were strong and similar across years.
Even though much attention has been paid to prevent malnutrition in Dutch nursing homes over the last decades, results show a relatively stable malnutrition prevalence rate of around 16%. This leads to the question if nursing staff is able to sufficiently recognize residents with (a risk of) malnutrition, and if they are aware of interventions they could perform to decrease this rate.","['Malnutrition', 'aged', 'long-term care', 'nutritional status']","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2021-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Everink', 'firstname': 'I H J', 'initials': 'IHJ', 'affiliation': 'Irma Everink, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Nederland, i.everink@maastrichtuniversity.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'van Haastregt', 'firstname': 'J C M', 'initials': 'JCM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Manders', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de van der Schueren', 'firstname': 'M A E', 'initials': 'MAE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schols', 'firstname': 'J M G A', 'initials': 'JMGA', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Even though much attention has been paid to prevent malnutrition in Dutch nursing homes over the last decades, results show a relatively stable malnutrition prevalence rate of around 16%.

25459734",Suicide among Older Adults with Dementia: Effects of Korea's Long-Term Care Insurance System.,"South Korea recently expanded its coverage rate of long-term care insurance (LTCI) by adding a ""dementia special grade"" in 2014 to improve care service accessibility and extend health life for older adults with dementia. In this study, we propose a multifaceted policy to reduce the suicide risk among older adults with dementia by evaluating the effectiveness of using the long-term care services (LTCS). A sample of 62,282 older adults was selected from the ""Older Adults Cohort DB"" of the National Health Insurance Service. We conducted Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression to represent the yearly survival curve from 2002 to 2015 according to the individual characteristics. Difference-in-difference estimation was conducted to identify the effect of LTCS on suicide rates by using LTCS before and after 2014. The suicide risk of older adults using LTCS was about 0.256-times lower than those who did not use it (OR = 0.296, 95% CI = 0.183-0.478), whereas it increased after the expansion of the dementia grading (OR = 2.131, 95% CI = 1.061-4.280). To prevent the risk of suicide among older adults with dementia, not only did the mortality rate vary depending on the sex, activities of daily living (ADL), and type of caregiver at the individual level but appropriate national intervention and management, such as improving the accessibility of LTCS, are also needed.","['dementia', 'long-term care insurance', 'older adults', 'suicide', 'survival analysis']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-07-03,"[{'lastname': 'Moon', 'firstname': 'Sungje', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute for Healthcare Policy, Korean Medical Association, Seoul 04373, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Mankyu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'BK21 FOUR R&E Center for Learning Health Systems, Department of Health Policy & Management, College of Health Science, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Sohn', 'firstname': 'Minsung', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health and Care Administration, The Cyber University of Korea, Seoul 03051, Korea.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph18126582

However, rates of SA-CCY are low and factors associated with these low rates require elucidation.
Primary MAPB admissions were pooled from NIS 2000-2014 (weighted n = 578 258). Patients with chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic masses, alcohol-related disorders, hypertriglyceridemia, acute cholecystitis and AP-related organ dysfunction or complications were excluded. Annual rates of SA-CCY were calculated. Regression model for prediction of SA-CCY was built on 2010-2011 subset (weighted n = 74 169), yielding 96.3% of complete observations.
Nationwide rate of SA-CCY in the U.S. was 40.8%. In multivariate analysis, SA-CCY was positively associated with BMI>30 (OR = 1.4, 95%CI 1.2-1.6), Asian ethnicity (vs. Black; OR = 1.2, 95%CI 1.0-1.5), private insurance (vs. Medicare; OR = 1.1, 95%CI 1.0-1.3), large (vs. small; OR = 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4) urban hospitals (vs. rural; OR = 1.5 95%CI 1.3-1.7) of the South (vs. Northeast; OR = 1.5, 95%CI 1.3-1.7), as well as with chronic cholecystitis (OR = 17.0, 95%CI 15.4-18.7) and abdominal-wall hernias (OR = 5.2; 95%CI 3.0-8.9); the latter two predictors were not included in the final model. SA-CCY was negatively associated with age >40 (OR = 0.72; 95%CI 0.66-0.79), male gender (OR = 0.86, 95%CI 0.80-0.93), dementia (OR = 0.88, 95%CI 0.72-1.1), chronic comorbidities (OR = 0.64; 95%CI 0.54-0.77) and ostomies (OR = 0.51; 95%CI 0.31-0.86).

All estimates of rates were weighted by sex, age, and living area (rural or urban) in the elderly Chinese population. The rate of mobile phone usage was 65.5% (14.3% for smartphone use). The prevalence of cognitive impairment in non-users of mobile phone, dumbphone users, and smartphone users were 17.8%, 5.0%, and 1.4%, respectively. The odds of having cognitive impairment in users of dumbphone and smartphone were lower than non-users after adjusting for demographics, lifestyle, and health-related factors (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.45; ","['cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment', 'dementia', 'elderly', 'mobile phone', 'smartphone']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-06-03,"[{'lastname': 'Qi', 'firstname': 'Shige', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yuying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yin', 'firstname': 'Peng', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Han', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhihui', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph18115695

32398686",Sex differences in the association between major cardiovascular risk factors in midlife and dementia: a cohort study using data from the UK Biobank.,"Sex differences in major cardiovascular risk factors for incident (fatal or non-fatal) all-cause dementia were assessed in the UK Biobank. The effects of these risk factors on all-cause dementia were explored by age and socioeconomic status (SES).
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and women-to-men ratio of HRs (RHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), smoking, diabetes, adiposity, stroke, SES and lipids with dementia. Poisson regression was used to estimate the sex-specific incidence rate of dementia for these risk factors.
502,226 individuals in midlife (54.4% women, mean age 56.5 years) with no prevalent dementia were included in the analyses. Over 11.8 years (median), 4068 participants (45.9% women) developed dementia. The crude incidence rates were 5.88 [95% CI 5.62-6.16] for women and 8.42 [8.07-8.78] for men, per 10,000 person-years. Sex was associated with the risk of dementia, where the risk was lower in women than men (HR = 0.83 [0.77-0.89]). Current smoking, diabetes, high adiposity, prior stroke and low SES were associated with a greater risk of dementia, similarly in women and men. The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and dementia was U-shaped in men but had a dose-response relationship in women: the HR for SBP per 20 mmHg was 1.08 [1.02-1.13] in women and 0.98 [0.93-1.03] in men. This sex difference was not affected by the use of antihypertensive medication at baseline. The sex difference in the effect of raised BP was consistent for dementia subtypes (vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease).
Several mid-life cardiovascular risk factors were associated with dementia similarly in women and men, but not raised BP. Future bespoke BP-lowering trials are necessary to understand its role in restricting cognitive decline and to clarify any sex difference.","['Dementia', 'Risk factor', 'Sex difference', 'UK Biobank']",BMC medicine,2021-05-20,"[{'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia. jgong@georgeinstitute.org.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Peters', 'firstname': 'Sanne A E', 'initials': 'SAE', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, Central Working - Fourth Floor, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College London, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.\nJulius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, PO Box 85500, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodward', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, Central Working - Fourth Floor, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College London, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.\nWelch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}]",,,"502,226 individuals in midlife (54.4% women, mean age 56.5 years) with no prevalent dementia were included in the analyses.

Cohort study.
All patients admitted with AMI (ICD-10-AM codes I21.0-I21.4) to all public and most private hospitals in Australia and New Zealand during 2009-2015.
All-cause mortality up to seven years after an AMI.
239 402 initial admissions with AMI were identified; the mean age of the patients was 69.3 years (SD, 14.3 years), 154 287 were men (64.5%), and 64 335 had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; 26.9%). 7-year survival after AMI was 62.3% (STEMI, 70.8%; non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], 59.2%); survival exceeded 85% for people under 65 years of age, but was 17.4% for those aged 85 years or more. 120 155 patients (50.2%) underwent revascularisation (STEMI, 72.2%; NSTEMI, 42.1%); 7-year survival exceeded 80% for patients in each group who underwent revascularisation, and was lower than 45% for those who did not. Being older (85 years or older v 18-54 years: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 10.6; 95% CI, 10.1-11.1) or a woman (aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.17) were each associated with greater long term mortality during the study period, as was prior heart failure (aHR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.76-1.83). Several non-cardiac conditions and geriatric syndromes common in these patients were independently associated with lower long term survival, including major and metastatic cancer, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, and dementia.
AMI care in Australia and New Zealand is associated with high rates of long term survival; 7-year rates exceed 80% for patients under 65 years of age and for those who undergo revascularisation.

63,33962245,Sex influences the effects of APOE genotype and Alzheimer's diagnosis on neuropathology and memory.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by severe cognitive decline and pathological changes in the brain (brain atrophy, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and deposition of amyloid-beta protein). Females have greater neuropathology (AD biomarkers and brain atrophy rates) and cognitive decline than males, however these effects can depend on diagnosis (amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD) and APOE genotype (presence of ε4 alleles). Using the ADNI database (N = 630 females, N = 830 males), we analyzed the effect of sex, APOE genotype (non-carriers or carriers of APOEε4 alleles), and diagnosis (cognitively normal (CN), early aMCI (EMCI), late aMCI (LMCI), probable AD) on cognition (memory and executive function), hippocampal volume, and AD biomarkers (CSF levels of amyloid beta, tau, and ptau). Regardless of APOE genotype, memory scores were higher in CN, EMCI, and LMCI females compared to males but this sex difference was absent in probable AD, which may suggest a delay in the onset of cognitive decline or diagnosis and/or a faster trajectory of cognitive decline in females. We found that, regardless of diagnosis, CSF tau-pathology was disproportionately elevated in female carriers of APOEε4 alleles compared to males. In contrast, male carriers of APOEε4 alleles had reduced levels of CSF amyloid beta compared to females, irrespective of diagnosis. We also detected sex differences in hippocampal volume but the direction was dependent on the method of correction. Altogether results suggest that across diagnosis females show greater memory decline compared to males and APOE genotype affects AD neuropathology differently in males and females which may influence sex differences in incidence and progression of aMCI and AD.","['Executive function', 'Gender', 'Hippocampus', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Tau, Amyloid beta']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-05-08,"[{'lastname': 'Duarte-Guterman', 'firstname': 'Paula', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health and Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Albert', 'firstname': 'Arianne Y', 'initials': 'AY', 'affiliation': ""Women's Health Research Institute of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Barha', 'firstname': 'Cindy K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health and Department of Physical Therapy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Galea', 'firstname': 'Liisa A M', 'initials': 'LAM', 'affiliation': 'Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health and Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

32505739",Predictive Values of Preoperative Characteristics for 30-Day Mortality in Traumatic Hip Fracture Patients.,"Hip fracture patients have a high risk of mortality after surgery, with 30-day postoperative rates as high as 10%. This study aimed to explore the predictive ability of preoperative characteristics in traumatic hip fracture patients as they relate to 30-day postoperative mortality using readily available variables in clinical practice. All adult patients who underwent primary emergency hip fracture surgery in Sweden between 2008 and 2017 were included in the analysis. Associations between the possible predictors and 30-day mortality was performed using a multivariate logistic regression (LR) model; the bidirectional stepwise method was used for variable selection. An LR model and convolutional neural network (CNN) were then fitted for prediction. The relative importance of individual predictors was evaluated using the permutation importance and Gini importance. A total of 134,915 traumatic hip fracture patients were included in the study. The CNN and LR models displayed an acceptable predictive ability for predicting 30-day postoperative mortality using a test dataset, displaying an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of as high as 0.76. The variables with the highest importance in prediction were age, sex, hypertension, dementia, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI). Both the CNN and LR models achieved an acceptable performance in identifying patients at risk of mortality 30 days after hip fracture surgery. The most important variables for prediction, based on the variables used in the current study are age, hypertension, dementia, sex, ASA classification, and RCRI.","['hip fracture', 'machine learning', 'neural network', 'postoperative mortality', 'prediction', 'variable importance']",Journal of personalized medicine,2021-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, 70182 Örebro, Sweden.\nUnit of Integrative Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Forssten', 'firstname': 'Maximilian Peter', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Orebro University Hospital, 70185 Orebro, Sweden.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, Orebro University, 70182 Orebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohammad Ismail', 'firstname': 'Ahmad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Orebro University Hospital, 70185 Orebro, Sweden.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, Orebro University, 70182 Orebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Borg', 'firstname': 'Tomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Orebro University Hospital, 70185 Orebro, Sweden.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, Orebro University, 70182 Orebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Ioannidis', 'firstname': 'Ioannis', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Orebro University Hospital, 70185 Orebro, Sweden.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, Orebro University, 70182 Orebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Montgomery', 'firstname': 'Scott', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, 70182 Örebro, Sweden.\nClinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohseni', 'firstname': 'Shahin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical Sciences, Orebro University, 70182 Orebro, Sweden.\nDivision of Trauma and Emergency Surgery, Department of Surgery, Orebro University Hospital, 70185 Orebro, Sweden.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/jpm11050353

Secondary data analysis of 2016-2017 national VA administrative data linked with Medicare claims.
Observational study examining sociodemographic, medical, and healthcare utilization characteristics associated with receipt of A&A among Veterans receiving pension.
In 2017, 9.7% of Veterans with pension newly received the A&A benefit. The probability of receiving A&A among black and Hispanic pensioners was 4.6 percentage points lower than for white pensioners (95%CI = -0.051, -0.042). Married Veterans receiving pension had a 4.4-percentage point higher probability of receiving A&A (95%CI = 0.039, 0.048). Most indicators of need for assistance (eg, home health utilization, dementia, stroke) were associated with significantly higher probabilities of receiving A&A, with notable exceptions: pensioners with a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (marginal effect = -0.029 95%CI = -0.037, -0.021) or enrolled in Medicaid (marginal effect = -0.053, 95%CI = -0.057, -0.050) had lower probabilities of receiving A&A. Unadjusted and adjusted rates of receiving A&A among Veterans receiving pension varied by VA medical center.
This study identified potential inequities in receipt of the A&A enhanced pension among a sample of Veterans receiving pension. Increased Veteran outreach, provider education, and VA office coordination can potentially reduce inequities in access to this benefit.","['Veterans', 'benefits', 'disability', 'long-term care', 'low income', 'older adult', 'social welfare program']",Health services research,2021-02-27,"[{'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Kali S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'Providence VA Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.\nSchool of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Corneau', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Providence VA Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'H Van Houtven', 'firstname': 'Courtney', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.\nDuke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cornell', 'firstname': 'Portia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Providence VA Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.\nSchool of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aron', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nSchool of Medicine, Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'M Dosa', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Providence VA Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.\nSchool of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'M Allen', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.'}]",,,,© 2021 Health Research and Educational Trust.,"10.1111/1475-6773.13636

68,33142365,Characteristics of urinary tract infections in older patients in a tertiary hospital in Greece.,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are commonly encountered. They are more commonly caused by Enterobacteriaceae, while antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem in their management, with extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa being increasingly common. The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of UTIs in patients admitted in a tertiary hospital, which mostly admits geriatric patients, and compare the effects of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes.
A retrospective observational study was conducted at a University Hospital in Crete, Greece. Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of patients with a UTI were recorded.
During the 3-year period of the study, 204 UTIs were recorded. Mean age was 83.3 years and 38.7% were male. The most common isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. Among all patients with UTI, 15.7% had an infection from ESBL, MDR, extensively drug-resistant or vancomycin-resistant enterococci pathogens. Recent antimicrobial use or hospitalization, dementia, bedridden state and sex were independently associated with mortality, while being a nursing home resident was independently associated with a higher possibility of infection from ESBL, MDR, extensively drug-resistant or vancomycin-resistant enterococci pathogens. Infection by such a resistant pathogen led to increased duration of hospitalization but not to increased mortality.
Alarming antimicrobial resistance rates were noted in patients with UTIs, and this led to longer duration of hospitalization even though it did not have an impact on mortality, which was otherwise higher than in other studies.

69,33137359,Sex and gender differences in cognitive and brain reserve: Implications for Alzheimer's disease in women.,"Women represent ⅔ of the cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current research has focused on differential risks to explain higher rates of AD in women. However, factors that reduce risk for AD, like cognitive/brain reserve, are less well explored. We asked: what is known about sex and gender differences in how reserve mitigates risk for AD? We conducted a narrative review of the literature, with keywords: ""sex/gender differences"", ""cognitive/brain reserve"", ""Alzheimer's Disease"", and the following cognitive reserve contributors: ""education"", ""IQ"", ""occupation"", ""cognitive stimulation"", ""bilingualism"", ""socioeconomic status"", ""physical activity"", ""social support"". Sixteen papers disaggregated their data by sex. Those papers observed sex and gender differences in reserve contributors. There is also evidence that greater reserve may be more beneficial in lowering AD risk in women, although more research is needed. We discuss how traditional reserve contributors are gendered and may not capture factors that support cognition in aging women.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Brain reserve', 'Cognitive reserve', 'Gender', 'Sex']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2020-11-03,"[{'lastname': 'Subramaniapillai', 'firstname': 'Sivaniya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, 2001 Avenue McGill College, Montréal, QC H3A 1G1, Canada; Brain Imaging Centre, Douglas Institute Research Centre, 6875 LaSalle Blvd Verdun, Montréal, QC H4H 1R3, Canada.

28364542",Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Mortality in Very Old Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in Spain.,"Advanced age is a well-known risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19. However, few studies have specifically focused on very old inpatients with COVID-19. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of very old inpatients with COVID-19 and identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality at admission.
We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, retrospective, observational study in patients ≥ 80 years hospitalized with COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals (SEMI-COVID-19) Registry (March 1-May 29, 2020). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A uni- and multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of mortality at admission.
A total of 2772 consecutive patients (49.4% men, median age 86.3 years) were analyzed. Rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, dementia, and Barthel Index < 60 were 30.8%, 25.6%, 30.5%, and 21.0%, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate was 46.9% (n: 1301) and increased with age (80-84 years: 41.6%; 85-90 years: 47.3%; 90-94 years: 52.7%; ≥95 years: 54.2%). After analysis, male sex and moderate-to-severe dependence were independently associated with in-hospital mortality; comorbidities were not predictive. At admission, independent risk factors for death were: oxygen saturation < 90%; temperature ≥ 37.8°C; quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score ≥ 2; and unilateral-bilateral infiltrates on chest x-rays. Some analytical findings were independent risk factors for death, including estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 500 U/L; C-reactive protein ≥ 80 mg/L; neutrophils ≥ 7.5 × 103/μL; lymphocytes < 0.8 × 103/μL; and monocytes < 0.5 × 103/μL.
This first large, multicenter cohort of very old inpatients with COVID-19 shows that age, male sex, and poor preadmission functional status-not comorbidities-are independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Severe COVID-19 at admission is related to poor prognosis.","['Age ≥ 80', 'COVID-19', 'Mortality', 'Prognostic factors', 'SARS-CoV-2']","The journals of gerontology.

71,33044181,The Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (IRAP) Study: Design and Baseline Characteristics.,"Family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with increased dementia-risk.
The Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (IRAP) is a prospective longitudinal study of asymptomatic middle-aged offspring of AD patients (family history positive; FH+) and controls (whose parents have aged without dementia; FH-) aimed to unravel the contribution of midlife factors to future cognitive decline and dementia. Here we present the study design, methods, and baseline characteristics.
Participants are members of the Maccabi Health Services, 40-65 years of age, with exquisitely detailed laboratory, medical diagnoses and medication data available in the Maccabi electronic medical records since 1998. Data collected through IRAP include genetic, sociodemographic, cognitive, brain imaging, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics at baseline and every three years thereafter.
Currently IRAP has 483 participants [mean age 54.95 (SD = 6.68) and 64.8% (n = 313) women], 379 (78.5%) FH+, and 104 (21.5%) FH-. Compared to FH-, FH+ participants were younger (p = 0.011), more often males (p = 0.003) and with a higher prevalence of the APOE E4 allele carriers (32.9% FH+, 22% FH-; p = 0.040). Adjusting for age, sex, and education, FH+ performed worse than FH-in global cognition (p = 0.027) and episodic memory (p = 0.022).
Lower cognitive scores and higher rates of the APOE E4 allele carriers among the FH+ group suggest that FH ascertainment is good. The combination of long-term historical health-related data available through Maccabi with the multifactorial information collected through IRAP will potentially enable development of dementia-prevention strategies already in midlife, a critical period in terms of risk factor exposure and initiation of AD-neuropathology.","['APOE E4', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'family history', 'offspring', 'risk factors']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Ravona-Springer', 'firstname': 'Ramit', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nMemory Clinic, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharvit-Ginon', 'firstname': 'Inbal', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Ganmore', 'firstname': 'Ithamar', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nMemory Clinic, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nDepartment of Neurology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Greenbaum', 'firstname': 'Lior', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nThe Danek Gertner Institute of Human Genetics, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Bendlin', 'firstname': 'Barbara B', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': ""Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Sternberg', 'firstname': 'Shelley A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Livny', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nDepartment of Diagnostic imaging, Seba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Domachevsky', 'firstname': 'Liran', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nDepartment of Diagnostic imaging, Seba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Sandler', 'firstname': 'Israel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diagnostic imaging, Seba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Ben Haim', 'firstname': 'Simona', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biophysics and Nuclear Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Ein Kerem, Jerusalem, Israel.\nInstitute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London and UCL Hospitals, NHS Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Golan', 'firstname': 'Sapir', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Ben-Ami', 'firstname': 'Liat', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nDepartment of Diagnostic imaging, Seba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Lesman-Segev', 'firstname': 'Orit', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diagnostic imaging, Seba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Manzali', 'firstname': 'Sigalit', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nDepartment of Pathology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Heymann', 'firstname': 'Anthony', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nMaccabi Healthcare Services, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Beeri', 'firstname': 'Michal Schnaider', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'The Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.'}]",,"Lower cognitive scores and higher rates of the APOE E4 allele carriers among the FH+ group suggest that FH ascertainment is good.

27491382",Acupuncture for mild cognitive impairment in elderly people: Systematic review and meta-analyses.,"Acupuncture has an unique role in preventing and managing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in nonpharmaceutical therapies because of its small wound, mild pain, and high security for many years. However, there is no systematic review evaluating safety and efficacy of acupuncture for MCI in elderly people. Therefore, this study will provide a protocol to explore the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for MCI in the elderly.
Retrieval from 8 electronic databases was conducted to determine eligible trials published until May, 2019. Homogeneity qualified studies were included for data were extracted such as study country location, demographic characteristics, and measure outcomes, and were analyzed by a random effect model and sensitivity analyses to identify heterogeneity. Review Manager (Revman Version 5.3) software will be used for data synthesis, sensitivity analysis, meta regression, subgroup analysis, and risk of bias assessment. A funnel plot will be developed to evaluate reporting bias.
A total of 15 randomized control trials involving 1051 subjects were included. The results were as follows: Compared with the control group, the clinical efficacy rates of acupuncture was better, odds ratio = 2.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.86, 3.42), P < .00001, mini-mental state examination scores (mean difference [MD] = 1.53, 95% CI [1.04, 2.01], P < .00001), Montreal cognitive assessment scores (MD = 2.05, 95% CI [1.17, 1.92], P < .00001), activity of daily living scale (MD = 1.71, 95% CI [-1.38, 4.79], P > .05), and clock drawing task scores (MD = 1.91, 95% CI [1.74, 2.08], P < .00001).

73,32978758,"Sex Differences in Antipsychotic and Benzodiazepine Prescribing Patterns: A Cohort Study of Newly Admitted Nursing Home Residents with Dementia in Ontario, Canada.","In nursing homes, residents with dementia frequently receive potentially inappropriate medications that are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Despite known sex differences in clinical presentation and sociodemographic characteristics among persons with dementia, few studies have examined sex differences in patterns and predictors of potentially inappropriate medication use.
The objectives of this study were to examine sex differences in the patterns of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine use in the 180 days following admission to a nursing home, estimate clinical and sociodemographic predictors of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine use in male and female residents, and explore the effects of modification by sex on the predictors of using these drug therapies.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 35,169 adults aged 66 years and older with dementia who were newly admitted to nursing homes in Ontario, Canada between 2011 and 2014. Health administrative databases were linked to detailed clinical assessment data collected using the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI-MDS 2.0). Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for clinical and sociodemographic covariates to estimate the rate of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine initiation and discontinuation in the 180 days following nursing home admission in the total sample and stratified by sex. Sex-covariate interaction terms were used to assess whether sex modified the association between covariates and the rate of drug therapy initiation or discontinuation following nursing home entry.
Across 638 nursing homes, our analytical sample included 22,847 females and 12,322 males. At admission, male residents were more likely to be prevalent antipsychotic users than female residents (33.8% vs 28.3%; p < 0.001), and female residents were more likely to be prevalent benzodiazepine users than male residents (17.2% vs 15.3%, p < 0.001). In adjusted models, female residents were less likely to initiate an antipsychotic after admission (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.86); however, no sex difference was observed in the rate of benzodiazepine initiation (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96-1.12). Female residents were less likely than males to discontinue antipsychotics (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98) and benzodiazepines (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.89). Sex modified the association between some covariates and the rate of changes in drug use (e.g., widowed males exhibited an increased rate of antipsychotic discontinuation (p-interaction = 0.03) compared with married males), but these associations were not statistically significant among females. Sex did not modify the effect of frailty on the rates of initiation and discontinuation.
Males and females with dementia differed in their exposure to antipsychotics and benzodiazepines at nursing home admission and their patterns of use following admission. A greater understanding of factors driving sex differences in potentially inappropriate medication use may help tailor interventions to reduce exposure in this vulnerable population.",[],Drugs & aging,2020-09-27,"[{'lastname': 'Maclagan', 'firstname': 'Laura C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'ICES, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Maxwell', 'firstname': 'Colleen J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'ICES, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada.\nSchool of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Daniel A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Campitelli', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'ICES, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Diong', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'ICES, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lapane', 'firstname': 'Kate L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, Worcester, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hogan', 'firstname': 'David B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Divison of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Rochon', 'firstname': 'Paula', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""ICES, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada.\nDalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nWomen's College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Herrmann', 'firstname': 'Nathan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Hurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bronskill', 'firstname': 'Susan E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': ""ICES, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada. susan.bronskill@ices.on.ca.\nDalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. susan.bronskill@ices.on.ca.\nWomen's College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada. susan.bronskill@ices.on.ca.\nHurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada. susan.bronskill@ices.on.ca.""}]",,,"Across 638 nursing homes, our analytical sample included 22,847 females and 12,322 males.

All 2653 symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from February 27 to April 2, 2020 in the Reggio Emilia province, Italy, were included. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalization and death rates, and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Females had higher prevalence of infection than males below age 50 (2.61 vs. 1.84 ‰), but lower in older ages (16.49 vs. 20.86 ‰ over age 80). Case fatality rate reached 20.7% in cases with more than 4 weeks follow up. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, men had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.4 95% CI 1.2 to 1.6) and of death (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1). Patients over age 80 compared to age < 50 had HR 7.1 (95% CI 5.4 to 9.3) and HR 27.8 (95% CI 12.5 to 61.7) for hospitalization and death, respectively. Immigrants had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.81) than Italians and a similar risk of death. Risk of hospitalization and of death were higher in patients with heart failure, arrhythmia, dementia, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, while COPD increased the risk of hospitalization (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) but not of death (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7). Previous use of ACE inhibitors had no effect on risk of death (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34).

None.
We analyzed the differences in sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities between subjects with sudden hearing loss and the comparison cohort group. Then, we estimated the risk of dementia and also plotted the survival outcomes to evaluate differences in dementia-free survival rates between the two groups.
The dementia incidence rates per 1000 person-years were 20.45 and 8.15 for the subjects with sudden hearing loss and comparison cohorts, respectively. When we adjusted for the subjects' characteristics, the hazard ratio for dementia was 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.68, p < 0.01) for subjects with sudden hearing loss compared with comparison cohorts during the follow-up period, and subjects with sudden hearing loss had lower 7-year dementia-free survival rates compared with comparison cohorts by using a log-rank test. Furthermore, male subjects with sudden hearing loss had a higher risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11) than did the male comparison cohorts.

Characterizing the number of individuals affected with dementia and their transitions are important to understand in order to plan for their healthcare needs. Using administrative health data in Ontario, Canada, we examined recent trends in the prevalence and incidence of dementia among the community-dwelling population, described their characteristics, and investigated admissions to long-term care (LTC) and overall survival.
Using a validated case ascertainment algorithm, we performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling PLWD aged 40-105 years old between 2010 and 2015. We assessed crude and age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and incidence, cohort characteristics, and time to LTC admission and survival.
Between 2010 and 2015, the adjusted community prevalence increased by 9.5% (p < 0.001), while the incidence decreased by 15.8% (p < 0.001). Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics remained similar over time, while the prevalence of comorbidities increased significantly from 2010 to 2015. There was no difference in the time to LTC admission for individuals diagnosed in 2014 when compared to 2010 (p = 0.06).

77,32651319,Sex Differences of Longitudinal Brain Changes in Cognitively Unimpaired Adults.,"There is increasing evidence that AD progression differs by sex.
The aim of this work was to determine sex differences in the association of baseline levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau, YKL-40, sTREM2) with longitudinal brain changes in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults.
This pilot study included 36 CU subjects (age 66.5±5.5, 12 male) scanned twice, two years apart. Using a voxel-wise analysis, we determined the sex differences in the association maps between CSF biomarkers and atrophy rates.
We did not find differences related to Aβ42. We found a greater impact of the rest of CSF biomarkers in areas of the Papez circuit in women versus men. Men showed greater involvement in lateral parietal and paracentral areas.
Results suggest an early differential progression of brain atrophy between sexes. Further research will elucidate whether the mechanisms responsible for sex-specific atrophy patterns are biological and/or environmental.","['Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers', 'YKL-40', 'cognitively unimpaired older adults', 'longitudinal VBM', 'sTREM2', 'sex differences']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-07-12,"[{'lastname': 'Falcon', 'firstname': 'Carles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.\nCentro de Investigación Biomédicaen Red Bioingeniería, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBERBBN), Madrid, Spain.\nIMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Grau-Rivera', 'firstname': 'Oriol', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.\nIMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.\nCIBERFragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), Madrid, Spain.\nServei de Neurologia, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Suárez-Calvet', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.\nIMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.\nCIBERFragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), Madrid, Spain.\nServei de Neurologia, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Bosch', 'firstname': 'Beatriz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': ""Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders Unit, Neurology Service, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Sánchez-Valle', 'firstname': 'Raquel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders Unit, Neurology Service, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Arenaza-Urquijo', 'firstname': 'Eider M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.\nIMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.\nCIBERFragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González-de-Echavarri', 'firstname': 'José María', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.\nIMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gispert', 'firstname': 'Juan Domingo', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.\nCentro de Investigación Biomédicaen Red Bioingeniería, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBERBBN), Madrid, Spain.\nIMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.\nUniversitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rami', 'firstname': 'Lorena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders Unit, Neurology Service, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Molinuevo', 'firstname': 'José Luis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.\nIMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.\nCIBERFragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), Madrid, Spain.\nUniversitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.'}]",,,We did not find differences related to Aβ42.

Population based matched cohort study.
Ontario, Canada between 2010 and 2015.
113 540 adults dying from cancer and non-cancer illness who were given newly initiated physician delivered palliative care in the last six months of life administered across all healthcare settings. Linked health administrative data were used to directly match patients on cause of death, hospital frailty risk score, presence of metastatic cancer, residential location (according to 1 of 14 local health integration networks that organise all healthcare services in Ontario), and a propensity score to receive palliative care that was derived by using age and sex.
Rates of emergency department visits, admissions to hospital, and admissions to the intensive care unit, and odds of death at home versus in hospital after first palliative care visit, adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and comorbidities).
In patients dying from non-cancer illness related to chronic organ failure (such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and stroke), palliative care was associated with reduced rates of emergency department visits (crude rate 1.9 (standard deviation 6.2) 
These findings highlight the potential benefits of palliative care in some non-cancer illnesses. Increasing access to palliative care through sustained investment in physician training and current models of collaborative palliative care could improve end-of-life care, which might have important implications for health policy.",[],BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2020-07-08,"[{'lastname': 'Quinn', 'firstname': 'Kieran L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada kieran.quinn@sinaihealth.ca.\nInstitute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), Toronto and Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nInstitute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Stukel', 'firstname': 'Therese', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), Toronto and Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nInstitute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Stall', 'firstname': 'Nathan M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nWomen's College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Anjie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), Toronto and Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Isenberg', 'firstname': 'Sarina', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nTemmy Latner Centre for Palliative Care, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanuseputro', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), Toronto and Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nClinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nSchool of Epidemiology, Public Health and Preventive Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nBruyère Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldman', 'firstname': 'Russell', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Temmy Latner Centre for Palliative Care, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nInterdepartmental Division of Palliative Care, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Cram', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nInstitute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), Toronto and Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nInstitute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kavalieratos', 'firstname': 'Dio', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Detsky', 'firstname': 'Allan S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nInstitute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bell', 'firstname': 'Chaim M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nInstitute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), Toronto and Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nInstitute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}]",,,"In patients dying from non-cancer illness related to chronic organ failure (such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and stroke), palliative care was associated with reduced rates of emergency department visits (crude rate 1.9 (standard deviation 6.2) ",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

79,32622881,The effect of occupation on the incidence of vascular dementia: A 12-year follow-up cohort study.,"Vascular dementia (DV) is the second cause of dementia with 15.8-20% of cases. Previous studies of the effect of occupation in DV do not show conclusive results, therefore, the objective was to analyze if the type of occupation can vary the risk of developing DV in those older than 55 years.
In the ZARADEMP project, a community sample of 4,803 individuals were followed longitudinally in 4 waves. The occupation was classified following the National Classification of Occupations of 2011 and the International Standard Classification of Occupations of 2008. Different standardized instruments were used: the medical and psychiatric histories (History and Aetiology Schedule) and other risk factors (Mini-Mental Status Examination, Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT). For this study, we calculated incidence rates, incidence rate ratios and hazard ratios in multivariate Cox regression models, stratified by gender. For this study, we included 3,883 participants.
In women, the risk of DV was doubled in blue-collar workers, with a moderate effect (Cohen's d=0.54), and multiplying by 2.7 in homeworks respect to white-collar with a moderate effect (Cohen's d=0.77), although they did not reach statistical significance. We did not observe the effect of occupation on the risk of DV in men.
We have found a moderate but non-significant effect between occupation and DV risk in women. We found no effect of occupation on the risk of VD in males while other clinical factors (age, diabetes or body mass index) presented a clearer effect than the occupation.","['Demencia vascular', 'Diferencias de género', 'Epidemiology', 'Epidemiología', 'Factor de riesgo', 'Gender differences', 'Occupation', 'Ocupación', 'Risk factor', 'Vascular dementia']",Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental,2020-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Gracia-Rebled', 'firstname': 'Ana Cristina', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Fisiatría y Enfermería, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, España.

28978359",5XFAD mice show early-onset gap encoding deficits in the auditory cortex.,"Early detection will be crucial for effective treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The identification and validation of early, noninvasive biomarkers is therefore key to avoiding the most devastating aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Measures of central auditory processing such as gap detection have recently emerged as potential biomarkers in both human patients and the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Full validation of gap detection deficits as a biomarker will require detailed understanding of the underlying neuropathology, including which brain structures are involved and how the operation of neural circuits is affected. Here we show that 5XFAD mice exhibit gap detection deficits as early as 2 months of age, well before development of Alzheimer's disease-associated pathology. We then examined responses of neurons in the auditory cortex to gaps in white noise. Both gap responses and baseline firing rates were robustly and progressively degraded in 5XFAD mice compared to littermate controls. These impairments were first evident at 2-4 months of age in males, and 4-6 months in females. This demonstrates early-onset impairments to the central auditory system, which could be due to damage in the auditory cortex, upstream subcortical structures, or both.","['5XFAD', 'Auditory cortex', 'Biomarker', 'Gap detection', 'Temporal processing']",Neurobiology of aging,2020-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Weible', 'firstname': 'Aldis P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Institute of Neuroscience, Eugene, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stebritz', 'firstname': 'Amanda J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Institute of Neuroscience, Eugene, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wehr', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Institute of Neuroscience, Eugene, OR, USA.

29669100","Sex, Race, and Age Differences in Prevalence of Dementia in Medicare Claims and Survey Data.","This study provides the first comparison of trends in dementia prevalence in the U.S. population using 3 different dementia ascertainments/data sources: neuropsychological assessment, cognitive tests, and diagnosis codes from Medicare claims.
We used data from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study and Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study, and a 20% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. We compared dementia prevalence across the 3 sources by race, gender, and age. We estimated trends in dementia prevalence from 2006 to 2013 based on cognitive tests and diagnosis codes utilizing logistic regression.
Dementia prevalence among older adults aged 70 and older in 2004 was 16.6% (neuropsychological assessment), 15.8% (cognitive tests), and 12.2% (diagnosis codes). The difference between dementia prevalence based on cognitive tests and diagnosis codes diminished in 2012 (12.4% and 12.9%, respectively), driven by decreasing rates of cognitive test-based and increasing diagnosis codes-based dementia prevalence. This difference in dementia prevalence between the 2 sources by sex and for age groups 75-79 and 90 and older vanished over time. However, there remained substantial differences across measures in dementia prevalence among blacks and Hispanics (10.9 and 9.8 percentage points, respectively) in 2012.
Our results imply that ascertainment of dementia through diagnosis may be improving over time, but gaps across measures among racial/ethnic minorities highlight the need for improved measurement of dementia prevalence in these populations.","['Cognitive tests', 'Diagnosis codes', 'Neuropsychological assessment', 'Racial/ethnic minorities', 'Trends']","The journals of gerontology.

27434743","Measuring dementia incidence within a cohort of 267,153 older Australians using routinely collected linked administrative data.","To estimate dementia incidence rates using Australian administrative datasets and compare the characteristics of people identified with dementia across different datasets. This data linkage study used a cohort of 267,153 from the Australian 45 and Up Study. Participants completed a survey in 2006-2009 and subsequent dementia was identified through pharmaceutical claims, hospitalisations, aged care eligibility assessments, care needs at residential aged care entry and death certificates. Age-specific, and age-standardised incidence rates, incidence rate ratios and survival from first dementia diagnosis were estimated. Estimated age-standardised dementia incidence rates using all linked datasets was 16.8 cases per 1000 person years for people aged 65+. Comparing incidence rates to the global published rates suggested 77% of cases were identified but this varied by age with highest coverage among those aged 80-84 years (92%). Incidence rate ratios were inconsistent across datasets for: sex, socio-economic disadvantage, size of support network, marital status, functional limitations and diabetes. Median survival from first dementia diagnosis ranged from 1.80 years in the care needs dataset to 3.74 years in the pharmaceutical claims dataset. Characteristics of people identified with dementia in different administrative datasets reflect the factors that drive interaction with specific services; this may introduce bias in observational studies using a single data-source to identify dementia.",[],Scientific reports,2020-05-31,"[{'lastname': 'Welberry', 'firstname': 'Heidi J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. h.welberry@unsw.edu.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Brodaty', 'firstname': 'Henry', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nDementia Centre for Research Collaboration, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsu', 'firstname': 'Benjumin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbieri', 'firstname': 'Sebastiano', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jorm', 'firstname': 'Louisa R', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}]",,,,,10.1038/s41598-020-65273-w,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de191f40>,,,,,,

21488247",Regional Variation in Rates of Total Knee Arthroplasty Among Medicare Beneficiaries.,"Rates of total knee arthroplasty vary widely across the United States. Whether this variation is associated with differences in patient characteristics or physician practice is unknown.
To determine regional variations in rates of total knee arthroplasty after accounting for the prevalence of knee arthritis and other potentially associated patient risk factors and to assess the correlation of these variations with measures of access to care and surgical indications.
This retrospective national cohort study used Medicare data on more than 24 million deidentified beneficiaries annually from 2011 to 2015. Individuals included had fee-for-service coverage, were 65 to 89 years of age, and resided in 1 of 306 health referral regions. Data were analyzed from September 13, 2018, to August 15, 2019.
Rate of primary total knee arthroplasty indexed to the national rate using observed to expected ratios. The expected numbers of arthroplasty procedures were derived from estimates based on beneficiaries' demographic and clinical characteristics. Observed to expected ratios were confounded by race/ethnicity; thus race/ethnicity-stratified analyses were conducted.
In 2011, there were 218 282 total knee arthroplasty procedures among 24 583 706 white Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age 74.2 [6.9] years; 54.6% women). The rate of arthroplasty during the study period (5 years) was 9.3 per 1000 person-years. Adjustment for clinical characteristics reduced the spread in observed to expected ratios among regions by 29% compared with adjustment for age and sex alone. However, substantial variation remained, with observed to expected ratios that ranged from 0.61 in Newark, New Jersey, to 1.82 in Idaho Falls, Idaho. High ratios were primarily present in the upper Midwest, Great Plains, and Mountain West regions. Higher ratios were associated with regions where beneficiaries had fewer outpatient visits (Spearman correlation [r], -0.64; 95% CI, -0.70 to -0.56) and with regions having more surgeons per capita who performed knee arthroplasty (r = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16-0.37). Higher ratios were associated with higher rates of arthroplasty procedures among beneficiaries with dementia (r = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.46), peripheral vascular disease (r = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42-0.61), and skin ulcers (r = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.32-0.53), which are relative contraindications to arthroplasty.
Substantial regional variation in rates of total knee arthroplasty remained after adjustment for patient characteristics.

Among all beneficiaries of the French health insurance general scheme aged 40 years or more, those with an incident ADRS in 2011, identified through long-term disease registry, hospitalization diagnoses or ADRS-specific drug delivery, were matched with beneficiaries without ADRS of the same age, gender and residence area. The annual incidence rates of all-cause hospitalizations (excluding those with a diagnosis code of ADRS) were compared between individuals with or without ADRS using incidence ratios (IRs) globally and by age, gender, deprivation index and modified Charlson score. We also studied cause-specific hospitalizations using patients' diagnoses and procedure codes.

30109466",Altered Body Composition and Increased Resting Metabolic Rate Associated with the Postural Instability/Gait Difficulty Parkinson's Disease Subtype.,"Weight loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is a common but poorly understood manifestation. Several studies have reported that weight changes could be related to motor symptoms, drug side effects, dysphagia, depression, and/or dementia. Weight loss in PD is not a benign phenomenon and it has several clinical and prognostic implications with increased morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is crucial to determine nutritional changes in PD patients in order to prevent malnutrition and improve their quality of life.
To compare body composition and resting metabolic rates between PD patients and controls.
A total of 64 PD patients and 52 controls were studied. The Hoehn-Yahr scale was used to determine the disease stage, clinical and epidemiological data were recorded from verbal questionnaire, Inbody S10® was used to collect corporal parameters, and FitMate system was used to assess the resting metabolic rate.
No significant differences were found between both experimental groups in age, gender, height, cholesterol levels, and the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and hypo/hyperthyroidism. However, the PD group showed lower body fat mass, whole-body fat percentage, and greater resting metabolic rate compared to controls (
These results suggest that PD patients present an increased resting metabolic rate associated with the postural instability/gait difficulty PD subtype, allowing a selective decrease of body fat mass and not musculoskeletal mass. Of note, several disease-related factors may contribute to this weight loss in PD patients, being a complex and multifactorial consequence. Our findings could likely be one of the many contributing factors. However, present findings may further add to our understanding of the phenomenon of weight loss in patients with PD.",[],Parkinson's disease,2020-04-08,"[{'lastname': 'Femat-Roldán', 'firstname': 'Giovana', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Neurocenter, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.\nTecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Ave. Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey 64710, NL, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Gaitán Palau', 'firstname': 'María Andrea', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Ave. Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey 64710, NL, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Castilla-Cortázar', 'firstname': 'Inma', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Ave. Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey 64710, NL, Mexico.\nFundación de Investigación HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Elizondo Ochoa', 'firstname': 'Georgina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Ave. Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey 64710, NL, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Moreno', 'firstname': 'Nancy Guadalupe', 'initials': 'NG', 'affiliation': 'Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Ave. Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey 64710, NL, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Martín-Estal', 'firstname': 'Irene', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Ave. Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey 64710, NL, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiménez Yarza', 'firstname': 'Miguel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Ave. Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey 64710, NL, Mexico.'}]",,,"No significant differences were found between both experimental groups in age, gender, height, cholesterol levels, and the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and hypo/hyperthyroidism.

25990258",State Variability in the Prevalence and Healthcare Utilization of Assisted Living Residents with Dementia.,"Almost 1 million older and disabled adults who require long-term care reside in assisted living (AL), approximately 40% of whom have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). States vary in their regulations specific to dementia care that may influence the presence of residents with ADRD in AL and their outcomes. The objectives of this study were to describe the state variability in the prevalence of ADRD among Medicare beneficiaries residing in larger (25+ bed) ALs and their healthcare utilization.
Retrospective observational national study.
National cohort of 293,336 Medicare fee-for-service enrollees residing in larger (25+ bed) ALs in 2016 and 2017 including 88,867 (30.3%) residents with ADRD. We compared this cohort's characteristics and healthcare utilization with that of individuals with ADRD who resided in nursing homes (NHs; n = 602,521) and the community (n = 2,074,420).
Medicare enrollment data, claims, and the NH Minimum Data Set were used to describe differences among ADRD patients in AL, NHs, and the community. We present rates of NH admission and hospitalization, by state, adjusting for age, sex, race, dual eligibility, and chronic conditions.
The prevalence of ADRD among AL residents varied by state, ranging from 24% to 47%. In 2017, AL residents with ADRD had higher rates of NH admission than their community-dwelling counterparts (adjusted national average = 24%, ranging from 14% to 35% among states). AL residents with ADRD had higher rates of hospitalization (38%) than populations in either NHs (29%) or the community (34%), and ranged from 29% to 45% of residents among states.
These findings have implications for states as they regulate AL and for healthcare professionals whose patients reside in AL. Future work is needed to understand specific elements of states' regulatory environments and local markets that may impact access and outcomes for this vulnerable population of residents with ADRD.

87,32113914,Duration of Care Trajectories in Persons With Dementia Differs According to Demographic and Clinical Characteristics.,"To estimate (1) the duration of no formal care, home care, and institutional care after dementia diagnosis, and (2) the effect of age, sex, living situation, dementia medication, migration background, and income on this dementia care duration.
Longitudinal retrospective study using routinely recorded general practice electronic health records linked with population-based healthcare and mortality data.
In total, 11,012 community-dwelling persons who received an incident dementia diagnosis and were listed in a Dutch general practitioner database from 448 general practices in the Netherlands.
Using multistate modeling analyses, we estimated the mean duration of care types (no/home/institutional care) for different ages based on simulations of transition rates and examined the influence of demographic and clinical factors on these durations.
From dementia diagnosis onward in 85-year-old men, the mean duration without formal care was 0.7 years, of home care 1.7, and institutional care 1.1 years. In 85-year-old women, the duration without formal care was 0.8 years, of home care 2.3, and institutional care 2.3 years. Total care duration was 3.5 years in 85-year-old men and 5.4 years in 85-year-old women. In men, the duration of home care was longer compared with no formal care and institutional care. The duration of no formal care was longer in persons not living alone, without prescribed dementia medication, with a non‒Western migration background, or with a higher income. The duration of home or institutional care was longer in women, persons without polypharmacy, in those living alone, or those with a Western background.
Our findings help to increase understanding of long-term dementia care trajectories and show that demographic and clinical factors determine the duration of care types. Our results can contribute to the organization of healthcare resource planning and monitoring of the effects of healthcare policy and interventions.","['Dementia', 'home care', 'institutional care']",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2020-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Janssen', 'firstname': 'Olin', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Alzheimer Center Limburg, Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.

24570145",Smoking prevalence in the area of responsibility of the German Ministry of Defense - results of the employee survey in the context of occupational health management.,"Tobacco use, correlated with reduced physical fitness, is one of the leading causes of avoidable death worldwide. It increases the risk of dementia and can shorten the lifespan by 10 years. For the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr), figures on smoking behavior have not been comprehensively captured. This study analyzes current data in a large sample from this population.
Based on an employee survey as part of the Occupational Health Management System, data on smoking behavior from 13,326 participants were analyzed in relation to age, gender, professional status, education level and membership in military operational units versus other agencies.
Smoking behavior varied significantly (P < 0.001) by age group (younger > older), gender, professional status, military agency membership status, and education level (the lower the education level, the higher the smoking rates). With the exception of the downward trend in smoking behavior with increasing age among civilian employees, these results were all significant (P < 0.005).
This data analysis shows that smoking prevalence among personnel in the area of responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Defense is comparable to the current data from corresponding surveys of the German population. Depending on gender, they generally show values that are slightly above those of the German population. The well-known trend in the general population of decreasing smoking prevalence with increasing age is also seen in this analysis. However, there are considerable differences in the smoking prevalence among individual subgroups (professional status, agency, gender, education level). The data show that particular young soldiers in the armed forces should be the target group for further preventive measures.","['Health promotion', 'Military', 'Prevention', 'Smoking']",Military Medical Research,2020-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Sammito', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department I 3 Research & Development, Air Force Centre of Aerospace Medicine, Cologne, Germany. drsammito@web.de.\nOccupational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany. drsammito@web.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Claus', 'firstname': 'Annika', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Institute for Teachers' Health, Institute of Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine of the Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Rose', 'firstname': 'Dirk-Matthias', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': ""Institute for Teachers' Health, Institute of Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine of the Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.""}]",,,"Smoking behavior varied significantly (P < 0.001) by age group (younger > older), gender, professional status, military agency membership status, and education level (the lower the education level, the higher the smoking rates).

22014136",Longitudinal Amyloid-β PET in Atypical Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.,"Rates of amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation have been characterized across the cognitively normal to typical Alzheimer's dementia spectrum, but little is known about Aβ accumulation in atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
We aimed tocharacterize longitudinal Aβ accumulation anddetermine the influence of age, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, disease duration, and sexin atypical AD and FTLD.
322 patients (138 atypical AD, 184 FTLD) underwent Pittsburgh compound B PET scanning, with 73 having serialPiB-PET scans (42 atypical AD, 31 FTLD). Global Aβ standard uptake value ratios were calculated for every scan. Mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of age, APOE genotype, disease duration, and sex on baseline and change measures of Aβ.
Atypical AD showed higher baseline Aβ than FTLD. Rate of Aβ accumulation was not associated with baseline Aβ in either group. Older age was associated with greater baseline Aβ and faster rates of accumulation in FTLD. In patients under age 70, atypical AD showed faster rates of accumulation than FTLD. APOEɛ4 genotype was associated with greater baseline Aβ in FTLD but did not influence rates of accumulation. Rates of Aβ accumulation were faster in FTLD patents with time from onset-to-PET≤4 years. Female sex was associated with faster rates of accumulation in atypical AD.
Accumulation of Aβ is observed in atypical AD and FTLD, although different demographic factors influence accumulation in these diseases providing insight into potentially different biological mechanisms of Aβ deposition.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'amyloid plaques', 'frontotemporal lobar degeneration', 'positron emission tomography']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-02-11,"[{'lastname': 'Whitwell', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tosakulwong', 'firstname': 'Nirubol', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Weigand', 'firstname': 'Stephen D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Graff-Radford', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Division of Behavioral Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Duffy', 'firstname': 'Joseph R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Division of Speech Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Clark', 'firstname': 'Heather M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Division of Speech Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Machulda', 'firstname': 'Mary M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Psychiatry, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Botha', 'firstname': 'Hugo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Division of Behavioral Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Utianski', 'firstname': 'Rene L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Division of Speech Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwarz', 'firstname': 'Christopher G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Senjem', 'firstname': 'Matthew L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\nDepartment of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Strand', 'firstname': 'Edythe A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Division of Speech Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ertekin-Taner', 'firstname': 'Nilufer', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jack', 'firstname': 'Clifford R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lowe', 'firstname': 'Val J', 'initials': 'VJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Josephs', 'firstname': 'Keith A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Division of Behavioral Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}]",,"Accumulation of Aβ is observed in atypical AD and FTLD, although different demographic factors influence accumulation in these diseases providing insight into potentially different biological mechanisms of Aβ deposition.","Atypical AD showed higher baseline Aβ than FTLD.

25683160",Health comorbidities and cognitive abilities across the lifespan in Down syndrome.,"Down syndrome (DS) is associated with variable intellectual disability and multiple health and psychiatric comorbidities. The impact of such comorbidities on cognitive outcomes is unknown. We aimed to describe patterns of physical health and psychiatric comorbidity prevalence, and receptive language ability, in DS across the lifespan, and determine relationships with cognitive outcomes.
Detailed medical histories were collected and cognitive abilities measured using standardised tests for 602 individuals with DS from England and Wales (age range 3 months to 73 years). Differences in prevalence rates between age groups and between males and females were determined using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. In adults, rates for psychiatric comorbidities were compared to expected population rates using standardised morbidity ratios (SMRs). Adapted ANCOVA functions were constructed to explore age and sex associations with receptive language ability across the lifespan, and regression analyses were performed to determine whether the presence of health comorbidities or physical phenotypes predicted cognitive abilities.
Multiple comorbidities showed prevalence differences across the lifespan, though there were few sex differences. In adults, SMRs were increased in males and decreased in females with DS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anxiety. Further, SMRs were increased in both males and females with DS for dementia, autism, ADHD, and depression, with differences more pronounced in females for dementia and autism, and in males for depression. Across the lifespan, receptive language abilities increasingly deviated from age-typical levels, and males scored poorer than females. Only autism and epilepsy were associated with poorer cognitive ability in those aged 16-35 years, with no relationships for physical health comorbidities, including congenital heart defects.
Our results indicate the prevalence of multiple comorbidities varies across the lifespan in DS, and in adults, rates for psychiatric comorbidities show different patterns for males and females relative to expected population rates. Further, most health comorbidities are not associated with poorer cognitive outcomes in DS, apart from autism and epilepsy. It is essential for clinicians to consider such differences to provide appropriate care and treatment for those with DS and to provide prognostic information relating to cognitive outcomes in those with comorbidities.","['Cognitive outcomes', 'Down syndrome', 'Health comorbidities', 'Intellectual disability', 'Psychiatric comorbidities', 'Receptive language ability']",Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,2020-01-25,"[{'lastname': 'Startin', 'firstname': 'Carla M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. carla.startin.09@ucl.ac.uk.\nDivision of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK. carla.startin.09@ucl.ac.uk.\nThe LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK. carla.startin.09@ucl.ac.uk.""}, {'lastname': ""D'Souza"", 'firstname': 'Hana', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'The LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.\nCentre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK.\nDepartment of Psychology & Newnham College, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ball', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'The LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.\nCentre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamburg', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.\nDivision of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK.\nThe LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Hithersay', 'firstname': 'Rosalyn', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.\nDivision of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK.\nThe LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Hughes', 'firstname': 'Kate M O', 'initials': 'KMO', 'affiliation': 'The LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.\nCentre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Massand', 'firstname': 'Esha', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'The LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.\nCentre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Karmiloff-Smith', 'firstname': 'Annette', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.\nCentre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Michael S C', 'initials': 'MSC', 'affiliation': 'The LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.\nCentre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Strydom', 'firstname': 'Andre', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.\nDivision of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK.\nThe LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium), London, UK.\nSouth London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.""}]",,,"Multiple comorbidities showed prevalence differences across the lifespan, though there were few sex differences.

24470773",Gender and Age Differences and the Trend in the Incidence and Prevalence of Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease in Taiwan: A 7-Year National Population-Based Study.,"Very few nationwide studies have focused on the variations in the incidence and prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Asian countries. This study aims to describe the gender and age differences in the incidence and prevalence of dementia and AD in Taiwan.
The data on dementia and AD were acquired from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2004 to 2010. The sex and age-specific rates were standardized, and the differences of gender and age on dementia or AD were assessed using Poisson regression analysis.
Over seven years, the prevalence of dementia and AD significantly increased from 4.7 to 7.6 per hundred people (
The standardized incidence rates of dementia and AD are much lower than the data reported in some studies from Europe, the US, and Japan. Further studies are warranted to explore which factors are associated with the differences in the incidence of dementia and AD in Taiwan.",[],BioMed research international,2019-12-10,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chih-Ching', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, No. 1, University Road, Tainan City 701, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Chung-Yi', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, No. 1, University Road, Tainan City 701, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Public Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, En Chu Kong Hospital, No. 399, Fuxing Road, Sanxia District, New Taipei City 23702, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Susan C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, No. 1, University Road, Tainan City 701, Taiwan.'}]",,,"Over seven years, the prevalence of dementia and AD significantly increased from 4.7 to 7.6 per hundred people (",Copyright © 2019 Chih-Ching Liu et al.,"10.1155/2019/5378540

11960124",Clarifying the neurobehavioral sequelae of moderate drinking lifestyles and acute alcohol effects with aging.,"Epidemiological estimates indicate not only an increase in the proportion of older adults, but also an increase in those who continue moderate alcohol consumption. Substantial literatures have attempted to characterize health benefits/risks of moderate drinking lifestyles. Not uncommonly, reports address outcomes in a single outcome, such as cardiovascular function or cognitive decline, rather than providing a broader overview of systems. In this narrative review, retaining focus on neurobiological considerations, we summarize key findings regarding moderate drinking and three health domains, cardiovascular health, Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cognition. Interestingly, few investigators have studied bouts of low/moderate doses of alcohol consumption, a pattern consistent with moderate drinking lifestyles. Here, we address both moderate drinking as a lifestyle and as an acute event. Review of health-related correlates illustrates continuing inconsistencies. Although substantive reductions in risk for cardiovascular and T2D events are reported, robust conclusions remain elusive. Similarly, whereas moderate drinking is often associated with enhanced cognition and lower dementia risk, few benefits are noted in rates of decline or alterations in brain structure. The effect of sex/gender varies across health domains and by consumption levels. For example, women appear to differentially benefit from alcohol use in terms of T2D, but experience greater risk when considering aspects of cardiovascular function. Finally, we observe that socially relevant alcohol doses do not consistently impair performance in older adults. Rather, older drinkers demonstrate divergent, but not necessarily detrimental, patterns in neural activation and some behavioral measures relative to younger drinkers. Taken together, the epidemiological and laboratory studies reinforce the need for greater attention to key individual differences and for the conduct of systematic studies sensitive to age-related shifts in neurobiological systems.","['Acute administration', 'Aging', 'Alcohol', 'Behavior', 'Cognition', 'Health', 'Moderate drinking', 'Neurophysiology', 'Older adults']",International review of neurobiology,2019-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Nixon', 'firstname': 'Sara Jo', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'University of Florida, Department of Psychiatry, Gainesville, FL, United States; University of Florida Center for Addiction Research & Education, Gainesville, FL, United States.

93,31721156,Comorbidities and sex differences in causes of death among mantle cell lymphoma patients - A nationwide population-based cohort study.,"The prognosis for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains poor. Our aim was to assess the impact of comorbidities on survival and causes of death. For 1,385 MCL patients (1,009 males, 376 females) diagnosed in 2000-2014 (median age 71 years, range 22-96) comorbidities ≤ 10 years of diagnosis were classified according to the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; 0, 1, 2+). Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to compare lymphoma-specific and all-cause mortality rates. Model-based predictions were used to obtain probabilities of death. Overall, 44% had any comorbidity (CCI 1+) and 28% severe comorbidity (CCI 2+). Over a median follow-up of 3·7 years (range 0-16), 633 (46%) died, the majority (76%) from lymphoma. Severe comorbidity was independently associated with higher all-cause [hazard ratio (HR) = 1·52; 95% CI: 1·24-1·85) and lymphoma-specific mortality (HR = 1·31; 95% CI: 1·04-1·65). Particularly among patients with connective tissue, renal and psychiatric diseases, and dementia. Among females with any comorbidity, non-lymphoma deaths represented a larger proportion of all deaths, compared to males with any comorbidity. In general, more efficient lymphoma treatments need to be considered also for patients with severe comorbidity. However, among females with any comorbidity, the likelihood of non-lymphoma death was still considerable, perhaps favouring a more liberal use of a ""wait and watch"" approach.","['cause of death', 'comorbidity', 'lymphoma-specific mortality', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'sex']",British journal of haematology,2019-11-14,"[{'lastname': 'Glimelius', 'firstname': 'Ingrid', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Clinical and Experimental Oncology, Uppsala University and Uppsala Akademiska Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medicine, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Smedby', 'firstname': 'Karin E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medicine Solna, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Eloranta', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Jerkeman', 'firstname': 'Mats', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Weibull', 'firstname': 'Caroline E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}]",,,,© 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/bjh.16317,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddfef400>,,,,,,

16204163",Sex differences by design and outcome in the Safety of Urate Elevation in PD (SURE-PD) trial.,"To investigate whether women and men with Parkinson disease (PD) differ in their biochemical and clinical responses to long-term treatment with inosine.
The Safety of Urate Elevation in Parkinson's Disease (SURE-PD) trial enrolled 75 people with early PD and baseline serum urate below 6 mg/dL and randomized them to 3 double-blinded treatment arms: oral placebo or inosine titrated to produce mild (6.1-7.0 mg/dL) or moderate (7.1-8.0 mg/dL) serum urate elevation for up to 2 years. Parkinsonism, serum urate, and plasma antioxidant capacity were measured at baseline and repeatedly on treatment; CSF urate was assessed once, at 3 months. Here in secondary analyses results are stratified by sex.
Inosine produced an absolute increase in average serum urate from baseline that was 50% greater in women (3.0 mg/dL) than in men (2.0 mg/dL), consistent with expected lower baseline levels in women. Similarly, only among women was CSF urate significantly greater on mild or moderate inosine (+87% [
Inosine produced greater increases in serum and CSF urate in women compared to men in the SURE-PD trial, consistent with the study's design and with preliminary evidence for slower clinical decline in early PD among women treated with urate-elevating doses of inosine.

95,31424408,Cohort Effects in Progression Rate on Cognitive and Functional Measures in an Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Cohort.,"Accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive and functional outcomes in clinical research requires consistent underlying rates of change over time.
To examine cohort effects in AD progression rate over five years of follow-up using a clinical database of probable AD patients.
Baseline characteristics of three cohorts enrolled from 1995-1999, 2000-2004, and 2005-2009 were compared using ANOVA and chi-square tests. Differences in 5-year decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the Lawton and Brody Physical Self-maintenance Scale (PSMS), and Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL) were assessed using longitudinal mixed effects regression, adjusting for age, sex, education, and other relevant clinical characteristics.
Cohorts 1 (n = 287), 2 (n = 257), and 3 (n = 374) did not differ on age, race, APOE genotype, or cognitive and functional measures. Educational attainment increased over time (13.4, 14.1, and 14.5 years, respectively, p < 0.001). Anti-dementia drug use at baseline was less common in Cohort 1 (32.2% versus 65.0%, and 66.8%, p < 0.001). The rate of decline in MMSE and CDR-SB did not differ across cohorts. ADAS-Cog scores for Cohort 2 declined more slowly than Cohort 3 (Btime ×cohort2 = -0.91 ± 0.35, p = 0.009), whereas Cohort 1 did not differ from cohort 3 (reference). Cohorts 1 and 2 differed from Cohort 3 in progression rate on the PSMS, but not the IADL.
There were no consistent temporal trends in progression rates over time. Longitudinal data over 15-20 years may be confidently pooled for outcomes analysis, but unexplained variability in rate of decline on some measures may occur.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'cognitive decline', 'cohort effects', 'disease progression']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019-08-20,"[{'lastname': 'Pavlik', 'firstname': 'Valory N', 'initials': 'VN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Wenyaw', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston, School of Public Health, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Darby', 'firstname': 'Eveleen', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}]",,,"Cohorts 1 (n = 287), 2 (n = 257), and 3 (n = 374) did not differ on age, race, APOE genotype, or cognitive and functional measures.

96,31324380,Effects of Socioeconomic Status on Alzheimer Disease Mortality in Taiwan.,"The combined effects of individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) on survival rates of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear.
Retrospective cohort study.
National Health Insurance Bureau of Taiwan data (2003-2012).
Patients with AD.
The authors aimed to analyze the effects of neighborhood and individual SES on the 5-year survival rates of patients with AD. The author defined individual and neighborhood SES based on income-related insurance payment amounts and residence in advantaged versus disadvantaged areas and compared survival rates using the Cox proportional hazards model after adjusting for risk factors.
A total of 1,754 patients with AD were identified. Each patient was followed for 5 years or censored. The 5-year overall survival rates were worst for those with a low individual SES in a disadvantaged area. After adjustment for sex, age, and comorbidities, patients with a low individual SES living in disadvantaged areas had the worse survival rate than those with a high SES (hazard ratio: 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53-3.13). In contrast, after the adjustment for characteristics, patients with a high individual SES in disadvantaged areas had a similar mortality rate to those with a high individual SES in advantaged areas (hazard ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.64-1.35).
Despite universal health coverage, patients with AD and a low individual SES in disadvantaged areas exhibited the worst survival rate. The socioeconomic survival gradient among patients with AD in Taiwan may result from differences in major attributes of individual and neighborhood SES.","['Alzheimer disease', 'dementia', 'mortality', 'socioeconomic status']",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,2019-07-22,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Chien-Liang', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Education and Research, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan; Division of Nephrology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Chih-Kuang', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yin', 'firstname': 'Chun-Hao', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Yu-Te', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Ching-Chih', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Otolaryngology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Nai-Ching', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

22437338",Cognitive heterogeneity in probable Alzheimer disease: Clinical and neuropathologic features.,"To identify heterogeneity in cognitive profiles of patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) who have mild to moderate dementia and satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria for a typical AD clinical trial, and to determine whether cognitive profiles are systematically related to the clinical course and neuropathologic features of the disease.
Neuropsychological test data from patients with mild to moderate probable AD (n = 4,711) were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Inclusion and exclusion criteria usually used in AD clinical trials were applied. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering were used to identify cognitive profiles in a subset of patients with autopsy-verified AD (n = 800) and validated in the overall (nonautopsy) sample and an independent cohort with similar test data. Relationships between cognitive profile, clinical characteristics, and rate of decline were examined with mixed-effects models.
In the autopsy-confirmed sample, 79.6% of patients had a typical AD cognitive profile (greater impairment of episodic memory than other cognitive functions), and 20.4% had an atypical profile (comparable impairment across cognitive domains). Similar results were obtained in the overall (typical 79.8%, atypical 20.2%) and validation (typical 71.8%, atypical 28.2%) samples. Atypicality was associated with younger age, male sex, lower probability of

Data were obtained from the 2010 Population Census by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and microdata on mortality in Brazil's 27 state capitals recorded in the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM) for the population 65 years or older by place of residence for the years 2009 to 2013. Corrections were obtained for underreporting of mortality, and final adjustments were made to the specific mortality rates based on Bayesian methods with prior probability distributions built on the basis of information obtained from a meta-analysis. The mortality rates from all dementias and from AD in Brazil were higher than in developed countries. The mortality rates from Alzheimer's disease in 2013 were 140.03 (95%CI: 117.05; 166.4) and 127.07 (95%CI: 103.74; 149.62) per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively, in men and women. The contribution of AD to mortality in elderly Brazilians was 4.4% (95%CI: 3.25; 5.72) in the group with 0 to 3 years of schooling, independently of age and sex. The study aimed to increase knowledge on corrected estimates of mortality rates from Alzheimer's disease based on vital statistics, providing more precise and pertinent evidence-based estimates.

99,31243489,[The future development of dementia diseases in Germany-a comparison of different forecast models].,"Dementia is one of the most frequent diseases of people aged 65 and older. As a result of the upcoming demographic transition, a significant increase is expected to the current number of around 1.7 million dementia patients. A precise estimate of this increase is especially important for decision-makers and payers to the health-care system. This study examined the effects of different assumptions on the future frequency of disease using a time-discrete Markov model with population-related and disease-specific components. Based on health insurers' administrative data from AOK Baden-Württemberg, we determined age- and gender-specific prevalence rates, incidence rates, and mortality differences of dementia patients and combined them with demographic components from German population statistics. As a result, our Markov model showed a 20 to 25% higher number of dementia patients in 2030, compared to the results of the status quo projection applied in most previous studies, with the assumption of constant prevalence rates over time. Hence, our results indicate that even in the medium term payers will have to face significant increases in dementia-related health expenditures. By 2060, the number of dementia patients in Germany would rise to 3.3 million assuming a further increase to life expectancy and constant incidence rates over time. The assumption of a compression of the morbidity would reduce this number to 2.6 million.","['Dementia patients', 'Demographic change', 'Forecast', 'Health insurers data', 'Markov model']","Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz",2019-06-28,"[{'lastname': 'Milan', 'firstname': 'Valeska', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Fakultät Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Studienbereich Gesundheitsmanagement, Hochschule Aalen, Beethovenstr.\xa01, 73430, Aalen, Deutschland.

27065855",Visual impairment in aging and cognitive decline: experience in a Memory Clinic.,"Visual impairment is common in people living with dementia and regular ophthalmological exams may improve their quality of life. We evaluated visual function in a cohort of elderly individuals and analyzed its association with their degree of cognitive impairment. Participants underwent neurological and neuropsychological exams, neuro-ophthalmological assessment (visual acuity, intraocular pressure, rates of past ophthalmological pathologies, use of ocular correction, treatments and surgeries) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan. We analyzed differences in ophthalmological characteristics among diagnostic groups. The final sample of 1746 study participants aged ≥ 50 comprised 229 individuals with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), 695 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 833 with Dementia (Alzheimer disease: n = 660; vascular dementia: n = 92, Lewy body dementia: n = 34; frontotemporal dementia: n = 19 and other: n = 28). Age, gender and education were used as covariates. Patients with Dementia, compared to those with SCD and MCI, presented worse visual acuity (p < 0.001), used less visual correction (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively) and fewer ophthalmological treatments (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively) and underwent fewer ocular surgeries (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001, respectively). OCT image quality worsened in parallel to cognitive decline (Dementia vs SCD: p = 0.008; Dementia vs MCI: p < 0.001). No group differences in past ophthalmological disorders or abnormal OCT findings were detected. Efforts should be made to ensure dementia patients undergo regular ophthalmological assessments to correct their visual function in order to improve their quality of life.",[],Scientific reports,2019-06-20,"[{'lastname': 'Marquié', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Alzheimer Research Center and Memory Clinic, Fundació ACE Institut Català de Neurociències Aplicades -

22886027",Disentangling Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: Two Empirically-Derived Subtypes.,"Clinical-pathological Alzheimer's disease (AD) subtypes may help distill heterogeneity in patient presentation. To date, no studies have utilized neuropsychological and biological markers to identify preclinical subtypes with longitudinal stability.
The objective of this study was to empirically derive AD endophenotypes using a combination of cognitive and biological markers.
Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped dementia-free older adults using memory, executive and language abilities, and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau. Brain volume differences, neuropsychological trajectory, and progression to dementia were compared, controlling for age, gender, education, and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4).
Subgroups included asymptomatic-normal (n = 653) with unimpaired cognition and subthreshold biomarkers, typical AD (TAD; n = 191) showing marked memory decline, high ApoE4 rates and abnormal biomarkers, and atypical AD (AAD; n = 132) with widespread cognitive decline, intermediate biomarker levels, older age, less education and more white matter lesions. Cognitive profiles showed longitudinal stability with corresponding patterns of cortical atrophy, despite nearly identical rates of progression to AD dementia.
Two clinical-pathological AD subtypes are identified with potential implications for preventative efforts.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'atypical AD', 'cluster analysis', 'heterogeneity', 'neuroimaging']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019-06-10,"[{'lastname': 'Blanken', 'firstname': 'Anna E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dutt', 'firstname': 'Shubir', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yanrong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nation', 'firstname': 'Daniel A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,Two clinical-pathological AD subtypes are identified with potential implications for preventative efforts.,"Subgroups included asymptomatic-normal (n = 653) with unimpaired cognition and subthreshold biomarkers, typical AD (TAD; n = 191) showing marked memory decline, high ApoE4 rates and abnormal biomarkers, and atypical AD (AAD; n = 132) with widespread cognitive decline, intermediate biomarker levels, older age, less education and more white matter lesions.

102,31175028,Incidence and characteristics of uncommon dementia subtypes: Results from 10 years of clinical surveillance by the Registry of Dementia of Girona.,"Age- and sex-stratified incidence rates of uncommon dementia subtypes are imprecise and scarce.
We used data from 7357 newly diagnosed individuals aged between 30.6 and 101.0 years from the Registry of Dementia of Girona during 2007-2016 to determine the incidence rates of uncommon dementia subtypes stratified by sex and age groups and to describe their clinical characteristics.
Uncommon dementia subtypes were classified according to their etiology. The incidence rate of uncommon dementia subtypes was 27.8 cases per 100,000 person-years for those aged 30 years and older, 3.7 cases per 100,000 person-years for people aged less than 65 years, and 110.9 per 100,000 person-years for those aged 65 years and older. Age, sex, dementia severity, and medical comorbidities were different depending on the dementia subtype.

103,31127762,Women Outperform Men in Verbal Episodic Memory Even in Oldest-Old Age: 13-Year Longitudinal Results of the AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe Study.,"Sex differences in verbal episodic memory function have been widely reported. However, sex-specific effects on rates of episodic memory decline remain controversial, and evidence is particularly scarce in the oldest-old population.
We aimed to investigate sex differences in trajectories of episodic memory performance in oldest-old individuals.
Based on 13-year longitudinal data with 9 follow-up assessments of a large sample of cognitively unimpaired old (75+) primary care patients (n = 3,254) participating in the German AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe study, we used linear mixed effects analyses to model sex-specific trajectories of change in verbal episodic memory while accounting for covarying factors.
We found that even in the highest age group women outperformed men in immediate (b = -1.71, p < 0.001) and delayed (b = -0.85, p < 0.001) free recall conditions. Associated late-life trajectories, however, did not differ significantly between the sexes. We further demonstrated that younger age, higher education, and an absence of depressive symptoms predicted better performance in both sexes.

104,31112120,"Dementia Mortality in the United States, 2000-2017.","Objectives-This report presents data on mortality attributable to dementia. Data for dementia as an underlying cause of death from 2000 through 2017 are shown by selected characteristics such as age, sex, race and Hispanic origin, and state of residence. Trends in dementia deaths overall and by specific cause are presented. The reporting of dementia as a contributing cause of death is also described. Methods-Data in this report are based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Using multiple cause-of-death data files, dementia is considered to include deaths attributed to unspecified dementia; Alzheimer disease; vascular dementia; and other degenerative diseases of nervous system, not elsewhere classified. Results-In 2017, a total of 261,914 deaths attributable to dementia as an underlying cause of death were reported in the United States. Forty-six percent of these deaths were due to Alzheimer disease. In 2017, the age-adjusted death rate for dementia as an underlying cause of death was 66.7 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population. Age-adjusted death rates were higher for females (72.7) than for males (56.4). Death rates increased with age from 56.9 deaths per 100,000 among people aged 65-74 to 2,707.3 deaths per 100,000 among people aged 85 and over. Age-adjusted death rates were higher among the non-Hispanic white population (70.8) compared with the non-Hispanic black population (65.0) and the Hispanic population (46.0). Age-adjusted death rates for dementia varied by state and urbanization category. Overall, age-adjusted death rates for dementia increased from 2000 to 2017. Rates were steady from 2013 through 2016, and increased from 2016 to 2017.

105,30901488,Prevalence and severity of symptoms suggestive of gastroparesis in prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Lewy body disease is postulated, by the Braak model, to originate in the enteric nervous system, before spreading to the central nervous system. Therefore, a high prevalence of gastroparesis symptoms would be expected in prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and be highest in those with a dopaminergic deficit on imaging. The aim of this study was to explore whether gastroparesis symptoms are an early diagnostic marker of prodromal DLB and explore the relationship between symptoms and dopaminergic imaging findings on FP-CIT SPECT.
We recruited 75 patients over 60 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 48 with MCI with suspected Lewy body disease (MCI-LB) and 27 with MCI with suspected Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD). All patients completed the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GSCI) questionnaire and also underwent FP-CIT [
At least one symptom suggestive of gastroparesis was reported in 48% (n = 23) MCI-LB vs 37% MCI-AD (n = 10) (P = 0.36). Rates of definite symptoms of gastroparesis, as defined by a GCSI total score ≥ 1.90, were rare and rates in MCI-LB were not different from MCI-AD (6% vs 0%, p = 0.55). After adjusting for gender differences between groups, no difference in gastroparesis symptom prevalence (2.27 vs 0.81 P = 0.05) or severity score (0.62 vs 0.28, p = 0.28) was noted between normally and abnormally visually rated FP-CIT SPECT scans.
The GCSI is not a useful tool for differentiating MCI-LB from MCI-AD. A low rate of definite gastroparesis was detected in prodromal DLB. No association was found between gastroparesis symptoms and FP-CIT SPECT findings.","['GCSI', 'Lewy', 'MCI', 'dementia', 'gastroparesis', 'prodromal']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2019-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Durcan', 'firstname': 'Rory', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Donaghy', 'firstname': 'Paul C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnett', 'firstname': 'Nicky A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Olsen', 'firstname': 'Kirsty', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Yarnall', 'firstname': 'Alison J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'John-Paul', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'McKeith', 'firstname': 'Ian', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Brien"", 'firstname': 'John T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Alan J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}]",,The GCSI is not a useful tool for differentiating MCI-LB from MCI-AD.

25756221",Huntington's disease in the United States: Variation by demographic and socioeconomic factors.,"Despite extensive research regarding the etiology of Huntington's disease, relatively little is known about the epidemiology of this rare disorder, particularly in the United States where there are no national-scale estimates of the disease.
To provide national-scale estimates of Huntington's disease in a U.S. population and to test whether disease rates are increasing, and whether frequency varies by race, ethnicity, or other factors.
Using an insurance database of over 67 million enrollees, we retrospectively identified a cohort of 3,707 individuals diagnosed with Huntington's disease between 2003 and 2016. We estimated annual incidence, annual diagnostic frequency, and tested for trends over time and differences in diagnostic frequency by sociodemographic characteristics.
During the observation period, the age-adjusted cumulative incidence rate was1.22 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval: 1.53, 1.65), and age-adjusted diagnostic frequency was 6.52 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval: 5.31, 5.66); both rates remained relatively stable over the 14-year period. We identified several previously unreported differences in Huntington's disease frequency by self-reported sex, income, and race/ethnicity. However, racial/ethnic differences were of lower magnitude than have previously been reported in other country-level studies.
In these large-scale estimates of U.S. Huntington's disease epidemiology, we found stable disease frequency rates that varied by several sociodemographic factors. These findings suggest that disease patterns may be more driven by social or environmental factors than has previously been appreciated. Results further demonstrate the potential utility of administrative Big Data in rare disease epidemiology when other data sources are unavailable. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","['Big Data', ""Huntington's disease"", 'incidence and prevalence', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neuroepidemiology']",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2019-03-15,"[{'lastname': 'Bruzelius', 'firstname': 'Emilie', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.\nMailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Scarpa', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Yiyi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.\nMailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Basu', 'firstname': 'Sanjay', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Faghmous', 'firstname': 'James H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baum', 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}]",,,"During the observation period, the age-adjusted cumulative incidence rate was1.22 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval: 1.53, 1.65), and age-adjusted diagnostic frequency was 6.52 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval: 5.31, 5.66); both rates remained relatively stable over the 14-year period.

24418058",Invited Commentary: Examining Sex/Gender Differences in Risk of Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias-Challenges and Future Directions.,"The majority of people living with Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias are women. Longer life expectancy is one factor thought to contribute to this observation, but possible sex-specific biological mechanisms have received considerable attention from the research community. In the current issue of the Journal, Buckley et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2019;188(7):1213-1223) use death certificate information on all deaths occurring among adults aged ≥60 years in Australia between 2006 and 2014 to evaluate sex/gender differences in rates of death with dementia (all types), AD dementia, and vascular dementia listed on the death certificate. The paper by Buckley et al. highlights several important methodological challenges for research examining sex/gender differences in risk of AD and related dementias, including challenges in measurement, survival bias and competing risks, and selection bias arising from sample selection. The current evidence on possible sex-specific biological risk factors for AD is intriguing, but there are numerous alternative explanations for differences in AD dementia and AD biomarkers between women and men. Triangulation of evidence from study designs with different strengths and weaknesses and transdisciplinary collaboration will be vital to generating conclusive evidence about sex/gender differences in risk of AD and related dementias.","['Alzheimer disease', 'competing risks', 'dementia', 'gender differences', 'outcome measurement errors', 'selection bias', 'sex differences', 'survival bias']",American journal of epidemiology,2019-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Mayeda', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth Rose', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.'}]",,,,"© The Author(s) 2019.

108,30824901,To What Extent Does Age at Death Account for Sex Differences in Rates of Mortality From Alzheimer Disease?,"Our objective was to compare sex-specific rates of death with Alzheimer disease (AD) or dementia as the underlying or associated cause of death using death records. Deidentified individual records on causes of death for all people aged 60 years or more who died in Australia during 2006-2014 (n = 1,104,684) were analyzed. There were 184,562 records with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes for dementia (AD, vascular dementia, or unspecified dementia). Death rate ratios for women versus men were estimated using Poisson regression. Women had a greater crude rate of death from all types of dementia than men (5.9 deaths per 1,000 person-years as compared with 3.8 deaths per 1,000 person-years), which disappeared after adjustment for age. For AD, the age-adjusted rate was higher among women (rate ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.16), while for vascular dementia age-adjusted rates were higher for men (rate ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.78, 0.82). There was no evidence of a differential bias in coding of dementia type between men and women. Women's older age at death explained much of the sex-related difference in rates of death from AD or dementia. However, excess numbers of AD deaths among women and vascular dementia deaths among men remained, providing support for the hypothesis of greater biological risk of AD in women.","['Alzheimer disease', 'dementia', 'mortality', 'population-level studies', 'vascular dementia']",American journal of epidemiology,2019-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Buckley', 'firstname': 'Rachel F', 'initials': 'RF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.\nMelbourne School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nFlorey Institutes of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Waller', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Masters', 'firstname': 'Colin L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Florey Institutes of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dobson', 'firstname': 'Annette', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.'}]",,,,"© The Author(s) 2019.

17690313",Incidence and prevalence of dementia associated with transient ischaemic attack and stroke: analysis of the population-based Oxford Vascular Study.,"Risk of dementia after stroke is a major concern for patients and carers. Reliable data for risk of dementia, particularly after transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke, are scarce. We studied the risks of, and risk factors for, dementia before and after transient ischaemic attack and stroke.
The Oxford Vascular Study is a prospective incidence study of all vascular events in a population of 92 728 people residing in Oxfordshire, UK. Patients with transient ischaemic attack or stroke occurring between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2012, were ascertained with multiple methods, including assessment in a dedicated daily emergency clinic and daily review of all hospital admissions. Pre-event and post-event (incident) dementia were diagnosed at initial assessment and during 5-years' follow-up on the basis of cognitive testing supplemented by data obtained from hand searches of all hospital and primary care records. We assessed the association between post-event dementia and stroke severity (as measured with the US National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score), location (ie, dysphasia), previous events, markers of susceptibility or reserve (age, low education, pre-morbid dependency, leucoaraiosis), baseline cognition, and vascular risk factors with Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education. We compared incidence and prevalence of dementia in our population with published UK population age-matched and sex-matched rates.
Among 2305 patients (mean age 74·4 years [SD 13·0]), 688 (30%) had transient ischaemic attacks and 1617 (70%) had strokes. Pre-event dementia was diagnosed in 225 patients; prevalence was highest in severe stroke (ie, NIHSS >10) and lowest in transient ischaemic attack. Of 2080 patients without pre-event dementia, 1982 (95%) were followed up to the end of study or death. Post-event dementia occurred in 432 of 2080 patients during 5 years of follow-up. The incidence of post-event dementia at 1 year was 34·4% (95% CI 29·7-41·5) in patients with severe stroke (NIHSS score >10), 8·2% (6·2-10·2) in those with minor stroke (NIHSS score <3), and 5·2% (3·4-7·0) in those with transient ischaemic attack. Compared with the UK age-matched and sex-matched population, the 1-year standardised morbidity ratio for the incidence of dementia was 47·3 (95% CI 35·9-61·2), 5·8 (4·4-7·5), and 3·5 (2·5-4·8), respectively. Consequently, prevalence of dementia in 1-year survivors was brought forward by approximately 25 years in those who had severe strokes, 4 years in those who had minor strokes, and 2 years in those who had transient ischaemic attacks. 5-year risk of dementia was associated with age, event severity, previous stroke, dysphasia, baseline cognition, low education, pre-morbid dependency, leucoaraiosis, and diabetes (p<0·0001 for all comparisons, except for previous stroke [p=0·006]).
The incidence of dementia in patients who have had a transient ischaemic attack or stroke varies substantially depending on clinical characteristics including lesion burden and susceptibility factors. Incidence of dementia is nearly 50 times higher in the year after a major stroke compared with that in the general population, but excess risk is substantially lower after transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke.

11205091","Drug use differs by care level. A cross-sectional comparison between older people living at home or in a nursing home in Oslo, Norway.","Drug consumption increases with age, but there are few comparisons of drug use between old people living at home or in a nursing home. To identify areas of concern as well as in need for quality improvement in the two settings, we compared drug use among people aged ≥70 years living at home or in a nursing home.
Cross-sectional observational study from Oslo, Norway. Information about drug use by people living at home in 2012 was retrieved from the Norwegian Prescription Database. Drug use in nursing homes was recorded within a comprehensive medication review during November 2011-February 2014. Prevalence rates and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals were compared between uses of therapeutic groups with prevalence rates of ≥5%. Drug use was compared for the total population and by gender and age group.
Older people (both genders) in nursing homes (n = 2313) were more likely than people living at home (n = 48,944) to use antidementia drugs (RR = 5.7), antipsychotics (RR = 4.0), paracetamol (RR = 4.0), anxiolytics (RR = 3.0), antidepressants (RR = 2.8), dopaminergic drugs (RR = 2.7), antiepileptic drugs (RR = 2.4), loop diuretics (RR = 2.3), cardiac nitrates (RR = 2.1) or opioids (RR = 2.0). By contrast, people living in a nursing home were less commonly prescribed statins (RR = 0.2), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (RR = 0.3), osteoporosis drugs (RR = 0.3), thiazide diuretics (RR = 0.4), calcium channel blockers (RR = 0.5) or renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RR = 0.5). Each of the populations had only minor differences in drug use by gender and a trend towards less drug use with increasing age (p <  0.01).
Drug use by older people differs according to care level, and so do areas probably in need for quality improvement and further research. In nursing home residents, this relates to a probable overuse of psychotropic drugs and opioids. Among older people living at home, the probable overuse of NSAIDs and a possible underuse of cholinesterase inhibitors and osteoporosis drugs should be addressed.","['Cardiovascular drugs', 'Community', 'Dementia', 'Drug use', 'Nursing homes', 'Older people', 'Opioids', 'Prescription database', 'Prevalence', 'Psychotropic drugs']",BMC geriatrics,2019-02-21,"[{'lastname': 'Fog', 'firstname': 'Amura Francesca', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'Nursing Home Agency, Oslo Municipality, Oslo, Norway. a.f.fog@medisin.uio.no.\nGeneral Practice Research Unit, Department of General Practice, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Postbox 1130 Blinderen, N-0318, Oslo, Norway. a.f.fog@medisin.uio.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Straand', 'firstname': 'Jørund', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'General Practice Research Unit, Department of General Practice, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Postbox 1130 Blinderen, N-0318, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Engedal', 'firstname': 'Knut', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian National Advisory Unit for Aging and Health, Vestfold County Hospital HF, Toensberg and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Blix', 'firstname': 'Hege Salvesen', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Drug Statistics, Norwegian Public Institute of Health, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,,"Older people (both genders) in nursing homes (n = 2313) were more likely than people living at home (n = 48,944) to use antidementia drugs (RR = 5.7), antipsychotics (RR = 4.0), paracetamol (RR = 4.0), anxiolytics (RR = 3.0), antidepressants (RR = 2.8), dopaminergic drugs (RR = 2.7), antiepileptic drugs (RR = 2.4), loop diuretics (RR = 2.3), cardiac nitrates (RR = 2.1) or opioids (RR = 2.0).

111,30655188,Effect of Sunlight Exposure on Vitamin D Status of Individuals Living in a Nursing Home and Their Own Homes.,"The present study was carried out to determine prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and related factors in individuals living in nursing home and their own homes.
This cross-sectional study included 72 elderly people 60 yr and older. All subjects were given a questionnaire form evaluating their individual characteristics, eating habits which affected their vitamin D status, wearing habits, and their duration of sun exposure and a Standardized Mini Mental Test evaluating their cognitive levels. Serum 25(OH)D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase and phosphorus levels, and bone mineral density measurements were also considered.
Vitamin D deficiency was observed in 47% of elderly people (nursing home: 64%, own home 31%, p = 0.05). Both 25(OH)D (14 ± 8 vs 27 ± 10, respectively, p < 0.001) and ultraviolet index value (0.63 ± 0.3 vs 0.92 ± 0.27, respectively, p < 0.001) were lower in people living in nursing home compared to ones living in their own homes. Parathyroid hormone level, on the other hand, was lower in people living in own homes. Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was more common in elderly people living in nursing home (100%) compared to those living in their own homes (64%) (p = 0.003). Osteopenia and osteoporosis incidence rates were also higher in elderly people living in nursing home (p = 0.001). No significant associations were found between vitamin D status and body mass index, smoking or dietary habits (p > 0.05). As levels of benefiting from ultraviolet index increased, significantly improvements were observed in 25(OH)D levels (p < 0.001).
In elderly people living in nursing home, vitamin D deficiency was higher and benefitting from ultraviolet index was lower compared to elderly people living in their own homes. Vitamin D deficiency could be prevented in elderly people, especially ones living in nursing homes, through enough sun exposure with appropriate clothing.","['Nursing home', 'elderly', 'sunlight', 'vitamin D']",Journal of clinical densitometry : the official journal of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry,2019-01-19,"[{'lastname': 'Okan', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Public Health Nursing, Tokat, Turkey.

25317258",Comparison of Mortality and Comorbidity Rates Between Holocaust Survivors and Individuals in the General Population in Israel.,"Previous studies have suggested that Holocaust survivors may experience different chronic comorbidities more often than the general population. However, the mortality hazard among these individuals has not been addressed.
To assess the overall mortality rate and comorbidities of a cohort of Holocaust survivors compared with an age-matched control group.
This cross-sectional study included all Holocaust survivors insured by Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel who were born between 1911 and 1945 in Europe and control individuals born in Israel during the same years and insured by the same service. Data were collected from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2017.
Rates of morbidities and mortality rates adjusted for sex, socioeconomic status, and body mass index using logistic regression, Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
The 38 597 Holocaust survivors included 22 627 women (58.6%) and had a mean (SD) age of 81.7 (5.4) years, and the 34 931 individuals in the control group included 18 615 women (53.3%) and had a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (5.3) years. The Holocaust survivors had higher rates than control individuals of reported hypertension (32 038 [83.0%] vs 23 285 [66.7]), obesity (12 838 [33.3%] vs 9254 [26.5]), chronic kidney disease (11 929 [30.9%] vs 6927 [19.8]), cancer (11 369 [29.5%] vs 9721 [27.8]), dementia (6389 [16.6%] vs 3355 [9.6]), ischemic heart disease, nonmyocardial infarction (5729 [14.8%] vs 4135 [11.8]), myocardial infarction (3641 [9.4%] vs 2723 [7.8]), and osteoporotic fractures among women (6429 [28.4%] vs 4120 [22.1]). In contrast, the overall mortality rate was lower among Holocaust survivors (25.3%) compared with the control group (41.1%). After adjustment for confounders, mean age at death was significantly higher in the survivor group compared with the control group.
The findings showed higher rates of comorbidities and lower mortality among Holocaust survivors, which may be associated with a combination of improved health literacy and unique resilience characteristics among Holocaust survivors. More research is needed to explore the biologic and psychosocial basis for these results.",[],JAMA network open,2019-01-16,"[{'lastname': 'Fund', 'firstname': 'Naama', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Maccabi Kahn Institute for Research and Innovation, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Ash', 'firstname': 'Nachman', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Maccabi Kahn Institute for Research and Innovation, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nFaculty of Medicine, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Porath', 'firstname': 'Avi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Maccabi Kahn Institute for Research and Innovation, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Shalev', 'firstname': 'Varda', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Maccabi Kahn Institute for Research and Innovation, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Koren', 'firstname': 'Gideon', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Maccabi Kahn Institute for Research and Innovation, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nFaculty of Medicine, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.'}]",,,"The 38 597 Holocaust survivors included 22 627 women (58.6%) and had a mean (SD) age of 81.7 (5.4) years, and the 34 931 individuals in the control group included 18 615 women (53.3%) and had a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (5.3) years.

In this retrospective observational study of Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) PD patients, we describe the clinical course and characteristics of LRRK2-GBA-PD and estimate the risk to develop PD for the double mutation carriers. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using published data on frequencies of GBA and LRRK2 mutations. Demographic and clinical data was retrieved from medical records and from rating at last visit.
Our analysis included 236 PD patients, divided into four groups: LRRK2-PD (n = 66), GBA-PD (n = 78), GBA-LRRK2-PD (n = 12) and mutation-negative PD (MNPD, n = 80 randomly selected). The estimated ORs in different models for GBA-LRRK2 PD were 15-28 (95% CI 6.7-72.0, p < 0.0001), compared to AJ controls. Using logistic regression (while controlling for sex, age at onset and PD duration), we found that probable REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was significantly more common for GBA-PD than for LRRK2-PD, while none of the GBA-LRRK2-PD patients reported RBD. Dementia was significantly more common for GBA-PD than for the LRRK2-PD and MNPD. Psychosis was the most common for GBA-PD and least common for LRRK2-GBA-PD.
While GBA-PD is characterized by higher rates of dementia, probable RBD and psychosis, it seems that compared to the other groups, these features are less common for LRRK2-GBA-PD.

27974474","Cognitive Function and Impairment in Older, Rural South African Adults: Evidence from ""Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in Rural South Africa"".","We aimed to estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment, and the sociodemographic and comorbid predictors of cognitive function among older, rural South African adults.
Data were from a population-based study of 5,059 adults aged ≥40 years in rural South Africa in 2015. Cognitive impairment was defined as scoring ≤1.5 SDs below the mean composite time orientation and memory score, or requiring a proxy interview with ""fair"" or ""poor"" proxy-reported memory. Multiple linear regression estimated the sociodemographic and comorbid predictors of cognitive score, with multiplicative statistical interactions between each of age and sex with education.
Cognitive impairment increased with age, from 2% of those aged 40-44 (11/516) to 24% of those aged ≥75 years (214/899). The independent predictors of lower cognitive score were being older, female, unmarried, not working, having low education, low household wealth, and a history of cardiovascular conditions. Education modified the negative associations between female sex, older age, and cognitive function score.
The prevalence of cognitive impairment increased with age and is comparable to rates of dementia reported in other sub-Saharan African countries. Age and sex differences in cognitive function scores were minimized as education increased, potentially reflecting the power of even poor-quality education to improve cognitive reserve.","[' Epidemiology', 'Africa', 'Age factors', 'Cognitive function', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Cross-sectional studies\xa0', 'Education', 'Prevalence', 'Sex', 'Sociodemographic characteristics']",Neuroepidemiology,2018-11-27,"[{'lastname': 'Kobayashi', 'firstname': 'Lindsay C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.\nHarvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Harvard T.H.

The goal of this study was to identify factors that could optimize screening in primary care and enhance its feasibility.
This is a cross-sectional study in rural, suburban, and urban primary care practices in Indiana. A total of 1,723 patients ≥65 years of age were screened for ADRD using the Memory Impairment Screen. Logistic regression was used to identify patient-specific factors associated with screening positive for ADRD.
The positive screening rate was 4.9%. Rates varied significantly across the three study sites. The rural site had the lowest rate (2.8%), which was significantly lower than the rates at the suburban (5.6%) and urban (6.6%) sites (

116,30195396,The Impact of Gender on Atrial Fibrillation Incidence and Progression to Dementia.,"There are a paucity of data regarding the role of gender and atrial fibrillation (AF) on cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Such data may provide insight into the disproportionate incidence of dementia in women and may help identify high-risk characteristics to target for prevention. We examined patients who underwent coronary angiography at an Intermountain Healthcare Medical Center and enrolled in a prospective cardiovascular database. To be included, patients could not have a previous diagnosis of AF or dementia and had to have 5years of follow-up. Endpoints included incident AF and dementia. Study cohort consisted of 35,608 patients without a previous history of AF or dementia, with 14,377 (40.4%) being woman. Women had lower rates of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and prior myocardial infarction, but higher rates of prior stroke. Men had a higher incidence of 5-year and long-term AF. However, women trended toward a higher incidence of 5-year and long-term dementia and stroke compared with men. In all groups of patients with and without AF, prior stroke predicted cognitive decline. In patients without a history of or development of AF, diabetes significantly increased risk of dementia. Women have higher rates of dementia over time than men, driven by higher baseline stroke rates and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. The higher dementia rates were in the setting of lower AF rates. However, in both men and women who develop AF, dementia rates are increased and do not show gender-based differences in risk.",[],The American journal of cardiology,2018-09-10,"[{'lastname': 'Golive', 'firstname': 'Anjani', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'May', 'firstname': 'Heidi T', 'initials': 'HT', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Bair', 'firstname': 'Tami L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Jacobs', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Crandall', 'firstname': 'Brian G', 'initials': 'BG', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Cutler', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Day', 'firstname': 'John D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Mallender', 'firstname': 'Charles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Osborn', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Weiss', 'firstname': 'J Peter', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah.'}, {'lastname': 'Bunch', 'firstname': 'T Jared', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, Utah; Stanford University, Department of Internal Medicine, Palo Alto, California.

117,30029279,[Dementia in Adults with Down Syndrome: A Frequent Reason for Admission to Psychiatry].,"This study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of dementia in a clinical sample of adults with Down syndrome. Consequences for clinical practice were deduced.
Patient characteristics and prevalence rates of dementia were evaluated in adults with Down syndrome who were admitted to psychiatry from 2005 to 2012 (N = 75).
In every third patient with Down syndrome, dementia was diagnosed in a second assessment 6 to 12 months after initial hospital admission. Patients with dementia were older and more often female, while no association was found with the level of intellectual disability. Thyroid function and calcium values were often abnormal in those with and without dementia.
In persons with Down syndrome, dementia is a prevalent cause for admission to psychiatry, especially in females and those of advanced age. Services should be adapted to the increased demands.

Dementia diagnoses were based on clinical workup and national health registry linkage. Incidence rates of any dementia and AD were greater in women than men, with any dementia rates diverging after age 85 and AD rates diverging around 80. This pattern is consistent with women's survival to older ages compared to men.

120,29985474,Sex differences in Alzheimer disease - the gateway to precision medicine.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by wide heterogeneity in cognitive and behavioural syndromes, risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. Addressing this phenotypic variation will be crucial for the development of precise and effective therapeutics in AD. Sex-related differences in neural anatomy and function are starting to emerge, and sex might constitute an important factor for AD patient stratification and personalized treatment. Although the effects of sex on AD epidemiology are currently the subject of intense investigation, the notion of sex-specific clinicopathological AD phenotypes is largely unexplored. In this Review, we critically discuss the evidence for sex-related differences in AD symptomatology, progression, biomarkers, risk factor profiles and treatment. The cumulative evidence reviewed indicates sex-specific patterns of disease manifestation as well as sex differences in the rates of cognitive decline and brain atrophy, suggesting that sex is a crucial variable in disease heterogeneity. We discuss critical challenges and knowledge gaps in our current understanding. Elucidating sex differences in disease phenotypes will be instrumental in the development of a 'precision medicine' approach in AD, encompassing individual, multimodal, biomarker-driven and sex-sensitive strategies for prevention, detection, drug development and treatment.",[],Nature reviews.

121,29865052,Increased Prevalence of Obesity/Type 2 Diabetes and Lower Levels of Lithium in Rural Texas Counties May Explain Greater Alzheimer's Disease Risk.,"To compare Alzheimer's disease (AD) mortality rates and coinciding risk factors in rural and urban Texas populations.
155 Texas counties were divided into 73 rural and 82 urban areas using the U.S. Census Bureau definition of rurality. Changes in age-adjusted AD mortality across these counties were calculated using a 7-year aggregation model from 2000-2006 and 2009-2015. Data pertaining to gender, race, education, obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity, and lithium concentrations in tap water were also collected from readily available databases.
Change in age-adjusted AD mortality was higher in rural counties (9.5±1.4) versus urban (5.9±1.1) over the time period examined. Similarly, obesity (30.2±0.2% ), diabetes (11.0±0.1% ), and physical inactivity (29.4±0.2% ) levels were significantly higher in rural populations compared to urban (29.1±0.2%, 9.7±0.1%, and 26.7±0.3, respectively). In contrast, the percent of population with some college education (40.1±0.7% ) was lower compared to urban (29.4±0.2% and 44.4±0.9%, respectively). Lithium concentrations in tap water was significantly lower in rural counties compared to urban (63.3±8.2 and 33.4±4.7μg/L, respectively). No significant differences were observed among females and however, we did find significant differences in the percent of African American and Hispanics. Correlational analysis uncovered a negative association between education status and AD mortality over time (r = -0.17). Further analysis controlling for physical inactivity, education, and trace lithium concentrations results in a loss of statistical significance.
AD mortality rates are higher in rural counties when compared to urban counties, and this may be linked to greater physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes, as well as lower trace lithium levels in tap water.","['Dementia', 'insulin', 'metabolic disorders', 'physical activity']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2018-06-06,"[{'lastname': 'Baranowski', 'firstname': 'Bradley J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayward', 'firstname': 'Grant C', 'initials': 'GC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Fajardo', 'firstname': 'Val A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada.\nCentre for Bone and Muscle Health, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'MacPherson', 'firstname': 'Rebecca E K', 'initials': 'REK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada.\nCentre for Neuroscience, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada.'}]",,,"Change in age-adjusted AD mortality was higher in rural counties (9.5±1.4) versus urban (5.9±1.1) over the time period examined.

122,29573708,Determinants of hospitalization and length of stay among people with dementia - An analysis of statutory health insurance claims data.,"Dementia is a crucial challenge in acute care hospitals. Using a retrospective claims data cohort, this paper explores dementia patients' acute hospitalization rates, risk factors, and length of stay.
The study used claims data from AOK PLUS, the largest statutory health insurance service (SHI) in Saxony, a federal state of Germany. The analysis included 61,239 people with dementia and 183,477 control subjects, all 65 years and older. Control subjects were age, gender, and regionally matched in a 1:3 ratio. Negative binomial hurdle regression was used to compare differences in hospitalization for the year 2014.
People with dementia had 1.49 times higher adjusted odds of being hospitalized at least once (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-1.52). Among those individuals hospitalized at least once, dementia increased the number of readmissions by 18% (95% CI, 1.15-1.20). Dementia patients also had a 1.74 times higher odds for at least one emergency admission compared to individuals without dementia (95% CI, 1.70-1.78). Dementia patients' admission risk factors included having care dependency, being recently diagnosed with dementia and living outside a metropolitan region. The increased length of stay for people with dementia per year was mainly attributable to higher admission rates.
Dementia patients are at higher risk for hospitalization, especially if they live outside the metropolitan region. Healthcare systems need to respond to the challenges resulting from the predicted demographic developments and increasing burden of dementia in the general population.","['Acute hospital utilization', 'Claims data analysis', 'Dementia', 'Health service', 'Hospital', 'Hospitalization']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2018-03-25,"[{'lastname': 'Motzek', 'firstname': 'Tom', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Chair for Social and Health Care Buildings and Design and Junior Researchers Group, ""Architecture under Demographic Change"", Faculty of Architecture, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

23613945",HIV-associated cognitive performance and psychomotor impairment in a Thai cohort on long-term cART.,"To assess cognitive performance and psychomotor impairment in an HIV-positive cohort, well-suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), in an Asian resource-limited setting.
Cross-sectional sociodemographic and cognitive data were collected in 329 HIV-positive and 510 HIV-negative participants. Cognitive performance was assessed using the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), WAIS-III Digit Symbol, Trail Making A, and Grooved Pegboard (both hands). Psychomotor test scores in the HIV-positive participants were converted to Z-scores using scores of the HIV-negative participants as normative data. Psychomotor impairment was defined as performance on two tests more than 1 standard deviation (SD) from controls or more than 2 SD on one test. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between HIV and non-HIV-related covariates and poorer cognitive performance and psychomotor impairment.
HIV-positive participants, mean age 45 (SD 7.69) years received cART for a median of 12.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9.1-14.4). Median CD4 cell count was 563 cells/mm
In this study, in individuals with viral suppression rates >90% on long-term cART, we found that inferior cognitive performance and psychomotor impairment were primarily associated with non-HIV-related factors.","['cognitive performance, psychomotor impairment, Asia, HIV-infection, HAND']",Journal of virus eradication,2018-03-24,"[{'lastname': 'Do', 'firstname': 'Tanya C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kerr', 'firstname': 'Stephen J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Avihingsanon', 'firstname': 'Anchalee', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Suksawek', 'firstname': 'Saowaluk', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Klungkang', 'firstname': 'Supalak', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Channgam', 'firstname': 'Taweesak', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Maejo University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Odermatt', 'firstname': 'Christoph C', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Economics, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Maek-A-Nantawat', 'firstname': 'Wirach', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruxtungtham', 'firstname': 'Kiat', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Ananworanich', 'firstname': 'Jintanat', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Valcour', 'firstname': 'Victor', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Reiss', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wit', 'firstname': 'Ferdinand W', 'initials': 'FW', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"HIV-positive participants, mean age 45 (SD 7.69) years received cART for a median of 12.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9.1-14.4).

124,29550172,Time Trends and Characteristics of Prevalent Dementia among Patients Hospitalized for Stroke in the United States.,"Little is known about how prevalent dementia rates among patients with stroke have evolved over the last decade or how this relationship varies by gender, race ethnicity, stroke type, or dementia type. We assessed time trends and demographic predictors of coexisting dementia in a large cohort of patients hospitalized for stroke.
Patient admission data between 1999 and 2012 were sourced from the National Inpatient Sample. Patient admission records were included in the retrospective analysis if they were diagnosed with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke during admission. Predictors of dementia subtype were analyzed using unadjusted and adjusted multinomial logistic regression.
Of 1,170,051 patients hospitalized for stroke between 1999 and 2012, 66,703 (5.7%) had a coexisting diagnosis of dementia. Female gender was associated with increased odds of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.19) but decreased odds of both vascular dementia (VaD) (aOR .50, 95% CI .44-.58) and non-Alzheimer's-nonvascular dementia (aOR .79, 95% CI .79, 95% CI .74-.83). Relative to whites, African-Americans had higher odds of AD (aOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18-1.32) and VaD (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.40-1.64). Similarly, Hispanics had increased odds of AD (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.30-1.50).
Rates of coexisting dementia among patients hospitalized for stroke in the United States have risen over the last decade. Prevalence of dementia among these patients varies by gender and race-ethnicity. Key demographic groups may need to be targeted to reduce disparities in dementia occurrence.","['Stroke', 'dementia', 'dementia subtype', 'hospitalization', 'nationwide']",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,2018-03-20,"[{'lastname': 'Sherzai', 'firstname': 'Ayesha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Loma Linda University Health, Loma Linda, California.

23956944",Utility of Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a Screening Tool for HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) In Multi-Ethnic Malaysia.,"This study determines the optimal cut-off scores for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to detect HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in a multi-ethnic Malaysian HIV-positive cohort by developing demographically corrected normative standards among 283 HIV-negative community-based controls with overlapping demographic characteristics. The norms (corrected for age, sex, education, ethnicity) were applied to 342 HIV-positive virally suppressed individuals on cART. Impairment rates were classified using the Global Deficit Score (GDS ≥ .5) method. The MoCA was also scored according to the recommended cut-off of ≤ 26, and functional decline was applied to both impairment definitions to classify HAND per the Frascati criteria. The ≤ 26 cut-off considerably overestimated cognitive impairment in both samples (59.4% HIV-negative; 69.3% HIV-positive). In contrast, corrected scores yielded impairment rates consistent with what has been reported internationally in virally suppressed cohorts (23.4% with 83.3% mild impairment, 16.7% moderate impairment).

126,29487974,[Prevalence of dementia of insured persons with and without German citizenship : A study based on statuatory health insurance data].,"Elderly people with a non-German background are a fast growing population in Germany.
Is administrative prevalence of dementia and uptake of nursing-home care similar in the German and non-German insured?
Based on routine data, administrative prevalence rates for dementia were calculated for 2013 from a full census of data from one large sickness fund. Patients with dementia (PWD) were identified via ICD-10 codes (F00; F01; F03; F05; G30).
Administrative prevalence of dementia was 2.67% in the study population; 3.06% in Germans, and 0.96% in non-Germans (p value <0.001). Age and sex adjusted prevalence was comparable in the insured with and without German citizenship, except in women aged 80-84 (17.2 vs. 15.4) and for men in the age groups 80-84 (16.5 vs. 14.2), 85-89 years (23.4 vs. 21.5), and above 90 years of age (32.3 vs. 26.3). Standardized to the population of all investigated insured, 31.4% of all Germans with dementia had no longterm care entitlement vs. 35.5% of all patients without German citizenship. Of German patients, 55.1% were institutionalized vs. 39.5% of all patients without German citizenship.
There was a higher prevalence of dementia in the very old insured without German citizenship compared to those with German citizenship, especially in men. Non-Germans showed lower uptake of nursing home care compared to Germans. Additionally, Germans had slightly higher nursing care entitlements. It should be investigated further how much of the difference is due to underdiagnosis, cultural differences, or lack of adequate diagnostic work-up.","['Administrative prevalence', 'Dementia', 'Germany', 'Migrants', 'Statutory health insurance']","Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz",2018-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Stock', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institut für Gesundheitsökonomie und klinische Epidemiologie, Uniklinik Köln (AöR), Gleueler Straße 176-178, 50935, Köln, Deutschland.

17468119",Gender differential in social and economic predictors of incident major depressive disorder in the Ibadan Study of Ageing.,"Working on the hypothesis that the social and economic factors associated with onset of late-life depression operate differently for men and women, we investigated the impact of current social relationships and lifetime occupational attainment on incident major depressive disorder (MDD) assessed in three follow-up waves over a period of 5 years.
Participants were part of a household multistage probability sample of 2149 Nigerians who were aged 65 years and above. The presence of current and lifetime MDD was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Participants' highest occupational attainment was categorised based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations, while socio-economic positions were estimated using asset-based measures relevant to low-income settings. Current social contacts and participation were assessed using items from the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule.
We found an incidence rate of 120.9 per 1000 persons years (95% CI = 110.4-132.5) among 1394 persons who were free of lifetime MDD and dementia at baseline. Incidence rates were 94.7 (95% CI = 82.5-108.7) and 153.8 (136.3-173.6) per 1000 person years, in men and women respectively. In analyses comparing gender and adjusting for the effect of age, we found that while a lifetime of unskilled occupation (trade: HR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-2.0, and elementary occupations: HR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) was significantly associated with incident MDD in men (but not in women), living in a rural location (HR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.7) and having no regular contact with family (HR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.0-4.7) at baseline significantly predicted subsequent onset of MDD in women.
There was a gender differential in the association of social and economic factors with incident MDD in this sample.

In analyses comparing gender and adjusting for the effect of age, we found that while a lifetime of unskilled occupation (trade: HR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-2.0, and elementary occupations: HR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) was significantly associated with incident MDD in men (but not in women), living in a rural location (HR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.7) and having no regular contact with family (HR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.0-4.7) at baseline significantly predicted subsequent onset of MDD in women.",,"10.1007/s00127-018-1500-7

128,29424552,Differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms between nursing home residents with young-onset dementia and late-onset dementia.,"The aims of the current study are (1) to explore the differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) between young-onset dementia (YOD) and late-onset dementia (LOD), and (2) to investigate whether the possible differences can be attributed to differences in dementia subtype, gender, psychotropic drug use (PDU), or dementia severity.
Three hundred and eighty-six nursing home (NH) residents with YOD and 350 with LOD were included. Multilevel modeling was used to compare NPS between the groups . Furthermore, dementia subtype, gender, PDU, and dementia severity were added to the crude multilevel models to investigate whether the possible differences in NPS could be attributed to these characteristics.
Higher levels of apathy were found in NH residents with YOD. After the characteristics were added to the models, also lower levels of verbally agitated behaviors were found in YOD .
We recommend that special attention be paid to interventions targeting apathy in YOD. Although no differences in other NPS were found, the PDU rates were higher in YOD, suggesting that the threshold for the use of PDU in the management of NPS is lower. This underscores the need for appropriate attention to non-pharmacological interventions for the management of NPS in YOD.","['Trial ID NTR5018', 'Young-onset dementia', 'neuropsychiatric symptoms', 'nursing home', 'psychotropic drugs']",Aging & mental health,2018-02-10,"[{'lastname': 'Appelhof', 'firstname': 'Britt', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Primary and Community Care , Center for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care and Public Health , Radboud University Nijmegen , Medical Centre , Nijmegen , the Netherlands.\nb Archipel, Landrijt , Knowledge Center For Specialized Care , Eindhoven , the Netherlands.\nc Radboud Alzheimer Center , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakker', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Primary and Community Care , Center for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care and Public Health , Radboud University Nijmegen , Medical Centre , Nijmegen , the Netherlands.\nc Radboud Alzheimer Center , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.\nd Florence, Mariahoeve , Center for Specialized Care in Young-Onset Dementia , The Hague , the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Duinen-van Den IJssel', 'firstname': 'Jeannette C L', 'initials': 'JCL', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Primary and Community Care , Center for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care and Public Health , Radboud University Nijmegen , Medical Centre , Nijmegen , the Netherlands.\nc Radboud Alzheimer Center , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Zwijsen', 'firstname': 'Sandra A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'e Department of General Practice and Elderly Care Medicine/EMGO + Institute for Health and Care Research , VU Medical Centre , Amsterdam , the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Smalbrugge', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'e Department of General Practice and Elderly Care Medicine/EMGO + Institute for Health and Care Research , VU Medical Centre , Amsterdam , the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Verhey', 'firstname': 'Frans R J', 'initials': 'FRJ', 'affiliation': 'f School For Mental Health and Neuroscience , Alzheimer Center Limburg , Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Vugt', 'firstname': 'Marjolein E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'f School For Mental Health and Neuroscience , Alzheimer Center Limburg , Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Zuidema', 'firstname': 'Sytse U', 'initials': 'SU', 'affiliation': 'g Department of General Practice , University of Groningen , University Medical Center Groningen , Groningen , the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Koopmans', 'firstname': 'Raymond T C M', 'initials': 'RTCM', 'affiliation': ""a Department of Primary and Community Care , Center for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care and Public Health , Radboud University Nijmegen , Medical Centre , Nijmegen , the Netherlands.\nc Radboud Alzheimer Center , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.\nh De Waalboog 'Joachim en Anna' , Center for Specialized Geriatric Care , Nijmegen , the Netherlands.""}]","Three hundred and eighty-six nursing home (NH) residents with YOD and 350 with LOD were included.

11728849",No difference in the prevalence of Alzheimer-type neurodegenerative changes in the brains of suicides when compared with controls: an explorative neuropathologic study.,"Suicide ranks among the leading causes of death for individuals of all ages with highest rates in the elderly. The cause of suicide is considered a multifactorial phenomenon. A variety of neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease, or, more recently, tauopathies as frontotemporal lobar degeneration or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, has been suggested as risk factor for suicide. Accordingly, we hypothesized that neurodegenerative changes typical of these diseases should be more prevalent in the brains of suicides when compared with controls. Suicides from the German federal state of Hamburg (n = 162) were compared with age- and sex-matched controls who died of other cause. Neuropathological assessment included semiquantitative analysis of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles visualized with silver stains; in addition, quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of β-amyloid load and counts of tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads was done. Univariate analysis and multivariable conditional logistic regression models did not show an effect of any parameter associated with the odds of committing suicide. On the contrary, after stratification for age, older suicide victims (over 48 years) showed lower β-amyloid loads when compared to controls in the univariate analysis (suicides: 4.7 ± 12.9; controls: 9.9 ± 20.9; p = 0.031; r = - 0.17). In conclusion, neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease and common tauopathies associated with age seem to be of limited relevance for suicides. However, intact cognition when planning and carrying out complex acts may be of importance in the context of suicide.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'Dementia', 'Depression', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Suicide']",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2018-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Matschke', 'firstname': 'Jakob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Forensic Neuropathology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany. matschke@uke.de.\nInstitute of Neuropathology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany. matschke@uke.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Sehner', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gallinat', 'firstname': 'Jürgen', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Siegers', 'firstname': 'Julia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Murroni', 'firstname': 'Melanie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Püschel', 'firstname': 'Klaus', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Legal Medicine, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Glatzel', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s00406-018-0876-4,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddd35630>,,,,,,

A secondary data analysis of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set was conducted. We selected samples of participants with normal cognition at baseline who progressed to MCI (n = 483) and those who progressed to probable AD (n = 211) to determine if hippocampal volume or white matter hyperintensities (WMH) at baseline predicted progression to probable AD or MCI and whether the rate of progression differed between men and women. The survival analyses indicated that changes in hippocampal volumes affected the progression to probable AD (HR = 0.535, 95% CI [0.300-0.953]) only among women. White men had an increased rate of progression to AD (HR = 4.396, CI [1.012-19.08]; HR = 4.665, 95% CI [1.072-20.29]) compared to men in other race and ethnic groups. Among women, increases in hippocampal volume ratio led to decreased rates of progressing to MCI (HR = 0.386, 95% CI [0.166-0.901]). Increased WMH among men led to faster progression to MCI (HR = 1.048. 95% CI [1.011-1.086]). Women and men who were older at baseline were more likely to progress to MCI. In addition, results from longitudinal analyses showed that women with a higher CDR global score, older age at baseline, or more disinhibition symptoms experienced higher odds of MCI development. Changes in hippocampal volumes affect the progression to or odds of probable AD (and MCI) more so among women than men, while changes in WMH affected the progression to MCI only among men.","['Alzheimer disease', 'brain', 'disease progression', 'hippocampus', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'men', 'sex characteristics', 'white matter hyperintensities', 'women']",Journal of women & aging,2018-01-11,"[{'lastname': 'Burke', 'firstname': 'Shanna L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'a Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work , School of Social Work, Florida International University , Miami , Florida , USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Tianyan', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'b Department of Health Policy and Management, Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work , Florida International University , Miami , Florida , USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fava', 'firstname': 'Nicole M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': 'a Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work , School of Social Work, Florida International University , Miami , Florida , USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Tan', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'c Department of Biostatistics, Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work , Florida International University , Miami , Florida , USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodriguez', 'firstname': 'Miriam J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'd Psychology Doctoral Program , Albizu University-Miami Campus , Miami , Florida , USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schuldiner', 'firstname': 'Katie L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'e Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work , Florida International University , Miami , Florida , USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Burgess', 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'e Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work , Florida International University , Miami , Florida , USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Laird', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'f Department of Physics, Center for Imaging Science , Florida International University , Miami , Florida , USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1080/08952841.2018.1419476

24125724",Gender effect on well-being of the oldest old: a survey of nonagenarians living in Tuscany: the Mugello study.,"The population of industrialized nations is progressively aging, with Italy having one of the most elderly populations in the world. Natural aging may be associated with physical and cognitive impairments, often straining public resources. The present study aims to investigate the influence of gender on wellness of the nonagenarians. We evaluated quality of life among nonagenarians living in the Mugello area, an Italian location with a large population of individuals > 90 years, using the Health Survey Scoring SF-12. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and Basic and Instrumental Activity of Daily Living scales were also assessed. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used to evaluate the cognitive status. In the current survey, women outnumbered men 2.7:1 confirming their higher longevity. However, on the basis of SF-12 scores, nonagenarian women felt worse than men, both physically (mean: women = 41.8 vs men = 44.4, p = 0.004) and mentally (mean: women = 46.7 vs men =48.5, p = 0.034), and their depression rates were higher: considering a General Depression Scale score ≥ 5 as a possible depression status; 37.5% of men reported depression vs. 48.5% of women (p = 0.021). Significant differences were observed also in daily activities, both basic (median: woman = 3 vs men = 5, p < 0.001) and instrumental (median woman = 1 vs me = 3, p < 0.001). Despite prior reports showing that women perform better than men in aging, our study confirms data reported in most national and European surveys: women live longer than men, but with poorer quality of life. The current study confirms the phenomenon known as the ""male-female health-survival paradox.""","['Aging', 'Health', 'Nonagenarian', 'Quality of life', 'Sex']",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2018-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Padua', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Neurosciences and Orthopaedics, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy. luca.padua@unicatt.it.\nDon Carlo Gnocchi Foundation Onlus, Piazzale Morandi n.6, 20121, Milan, Italy. luca.padua@unicatt.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasqualetti', 'firstname': 'Patrizio', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Service of Medical Statistics and Information Technology (SeSMIT), Fatebenefratelli, Hospital-Isola Tiberina, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Coraci', 'firstname': 'Daniele', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation Onlus, Piazzale Morandi n.6, 20121, Milan, Italy.\nBoard of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Department of Orthopaedic Science, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Imbimbo', 'firstname': 'Isabella', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation Onlus, Piazzale Morandi n.6, 20121, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Giordani', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Service of Medical Statistics and Information Technology (SeSMIT), Fatebenefratelli, Hospital-Isola Tiberina, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Loreti', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation Onlus, Piazzale Morandi n.6, 20121, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Marra', 'firstname': 'Camillo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Center for Neuropsychological Research, Institute of Neurology of the Policlinico Gemelli, Catholic University of Rome, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Molino-Lova', 'firstname': 'Raffaello', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus Foundation, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasquini', 'firstname': 'Guido', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus Foundation, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Simonelli', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Service of Medical Statistics and Information Technology (SeSMIT), Fatebenefratelli, Hospital-Isola Tiberina, Rome, Italy.\nInstitute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, National Research Council of Italy, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Vannetti', 'firstname': 'Federica', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus Foundation, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Macchi', 'firstname': 'Claudio', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus Foundation, Florence, Italy.\nDepartment of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s10072-017-3223-z,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddd06810>,,,,,,

21865270",Underreporting of Gender and Race/Ethnicity Differences in NIH-Funded Dementia Caregiver Support Interventions.,"Women and racial/ethnic minority dementia caregivers have unique caregiving experiences and support needs. To ensure the identification of potentially important differences in outcomes within these groups, the amended National Institutes of Health (NIH) Policy on Inclusion of Women and Minorities mandates reporting by gender and race/ethnicity. The objective of this study was to determine the inclusion and reporting rates among NIH-funded dementia caregiver support interventions. A focused systematic literature review of studies published from 1994 to 2015 located 48 articles meeting inclusion criteria. The majority of studies included women and racial/ethnic minorities; however, 67% did not report results by gender or racial/ethnic group.

21896736","Cross-national gender variations of digit ratio (2D:4D) correlate with life expectancy, suicide rate, and other causes of death.","The second-to-fourth finger length ratio (2D:4D) is an indication of prenatal sex hormone exposure, and has sex-specifically been associated with several lethal illnesses including ischemic heart disease, diverse cancers, and suicide. Our primary aim was to verify that 2D:4D sex-specifically relates to life expectancy and suicide numbers on a national level (23 countries). We also used a hypothesis-free approach to investigate associations with other causes of death [p value adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate procedure (FDR)]. All parameters were normalized to the national mean (of males and females) and analyzed across nations. Normalized male 2D:4D correlated positively with normalized male life expectancy (at birth, r = 0.46, p = 0.029; at the age of 60, r = 0.44, p = 0.038) and negatively with normalized male suicide rates (r = - 0.49, p = 0.017). In the exploratory analyses, the normalized male 2D:4D values were negatively associated with the normalized male deaths rates from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions [r = - 0.65, p(FDR) = 0.011], respiratory infections [r = - 0.69, p(FDR) = 0.008], asthma [r = - 0.65, p(FDR) = 0.011], neurological conditions [r = - 0.56, p(FDR) = 0.046], and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias [r = - 0.59, p(FDR) = 0.036]. The normalized female parameters showed the same cross-national correlations. In line with the previous individual level findings, the results suggest that prenatal sex hormone effects are sex-specifically involved in suicide and neurological conditions. Moreover, we provide novel national level evidence that prenatal sex hormone priming may sex-specifically influence life expectancy and death risk from respiratory diseases.","['Asthma', 'Causes of death', 'Digit ratio', 'Life expectancy', 'Respiratory infections', 'Suicide']","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2017-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Lenz', 'firstname': 'Bernd', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, Erlangen, Germany. bernd.lenz@uk-erlangen.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Kornhuber', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.'}]",,,,,"10.1007/s00702-017-1815-7

134,29100858,The Incidence and Characteristics of Stroke in Urban-Dwelling Iranian Women.,"Population-based data regarding stroke among women are scarce in developing countries. This study was designed to determine whether sex differences exist in stroke incidence, mortality, and recurrence.
The Mashhad Stroke Incidence Study is a population-based cohort study in Iran. For a period of 1 year, all patients with stroke in 3 geographical regions in Mashhad were recruited and then followed up for 5 years. Age- and sex-specific crude incidence rates were standardized to the World Health Organization New World Population. Male-to-female incidence rate ratios were assessed for all age groups and all subtypes of first-ever stroke (FES).
The annual crude incidence rate of FES (per 100,000 population) was similar in men (144; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 129-160) and women (133; 95% CI: 119-149). Standardized FES annual incidence rates were 239 (95% CI: 213-267) for men and 225 (95% CI 200-253) for women, both greater than in most western countries. There were no significant differences in stroke recurrence or case-fatality between women and men during early and long-term follow-up.
The similar incidence of stroke between men and women highlights the importance of equally prioritizing adequate preventive strategies for both sexes. The greater relative incidence of stroke in women in Mashhad compared with other countries warrants improvement of primary and secondary stroke prevention.","['Women', 'incidence', 'mortality', 'recurrence', 'stroke']",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,2017-11-05,"[{'lastname': 'Amiri', 'firstname': 'Amin', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Kapral', 'firstname': 'Moira K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and Toronto General Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Thrift', 'firstname': 'Amanda G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Stroke and Ageing Research, School of Clinical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia; Stroke Division, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sposato', 'firstname': 'Luciano A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurological Science, University Hospital, London Health Science Center, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada; Stroke, Dementia & Heart Disease Laboratory, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Saber', 'firstname': 'Hamidreza', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Behrouz', 'firstname': 'Reza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Texas, Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Erfanian', 'firstname': 'Mahdiyeh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.'}, {'lastname': 'Farzadfard', 'firstname': 'Mohammad Taghi', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mokhber', 'firstname': 'Naghmeh', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Azarpazhooh', 'firstname': 'Mahmoud Reza', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Department of Clinical Neurological Science, University Hospital, London Health Science Center, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.

135,29064737,Effects of APOE haplotypes and measures of cardiovascular risk over gender-dependent cognitive and functional changes in one year in Alzheimer's disease.,"Illiteracy, high cerebrovascular risk and copies of APOE-ϵ4 are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD). We aimed to investigate the impacts of gender, education, coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and creatinine clearance variations, body mass index (BMI) and APOE haplotypes over the rates of cognitive and functional decline of AD in one year.
Consecutive outpatients with late-onset AD were assessed for gender, schooling, BMI and APOE haplotypes, variations in one year of creatinine clearance and Framingham projections of the 10-year absolute CHD risk, and prospective scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SOB), the Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Lawton's Scale for Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL).
For 191 patients, mean age at AD onset was 73.26 ± 6.4 years-old, earlier for APOE-ϵ4/ϵ4 carriers (p = 0.0039). For women, higher BMI led to improvements in CDR-SOB (β = -0.091; p = 0.037) and MMSE (β = 0.126; p = 0.017) scores, while increased creatinine clearance was associated with improvements in ADL (β = 0.028; p = 0.012) and MMSE (β = 0.043; p = 0.039) scores and higher schooling led to faster worsening of IADL (β = -0.195; p = 0.022) scores. No variables impacted cognitive or functional decline for men, whereas copies of APOE-ϵ4 and the CHD risk had no significant effects whatsoever.
Higher BMI and creatinine clearance are protective regarding cognitive and functional decline for women, whereas higher cognitive reserve may lead to faster decline in instrumental functionality. APOE haplotypes affected the age at AD onset, but not cognitive or functional decline.","['Activities of daily living', 'Alzheimer disease', 'cognition', 'educational status', 'risk factors']",The International journal of neuroscience,2017-10-25,"[{'lastname': 'de Oliveira', 'firstname': 'Fabricio Ferreira', 'initials': 'FF', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery , Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) , São Paulo , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Fernando Vieira', 'initials': 'FV', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery , Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) , São Paulo , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Pivi', 'firstname': 'Glaucia Akiko Kamikado', 'initials': 'GAK', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery , Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) , São Paulo , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Marilia Cardoso', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'b Department of Morphology and Genetics, Escola Paulista de Medicina , Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) , São Paulo , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bertolucci', 'firstname': 'Paulo Henrique Ferreira', 'initials': 'PHF', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery , Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) , São Paulo , Brazil.'}]",,,"For 191 patients, mean age at AD onset was 73.26 ± 6.4 years-old, earlier for APOE-ϵ4/ϵ4 carriers (p = 0.0039).

136,28958040,Physical Health Problems as a Late-Life Suicide Precipitant: Examination of Coroner/Medical Examiner and Law Enforcement Reports.,"In light of high late-life suicide rates, we compared older suicide decedents with and without physical health problems as a suicide precipitant with respect to their clinical characteristics and suicide means. We also examined health-related concerns noted in summary coroner/medical examiner or law enforcement (CME/LE) reports.
The National Violent Death Reporting System, 2005-2014, provided data (N = 16,924 aged 65 or older). Quantitative data were analyzed using logistic regression models with physical health problems as a suicide precipitant as the dependent variable and depressive symptoms, other precipitating/risk factors, and suicide means as the independent variables. CME/LE reports were analyzed using content analysis and descriptive statistics.
Physical health problems were recorded as a suicide precipitant for 50% of the older decedents. Compared to those without, those with physical health problems as a precipitant were older and more likely to have had depressed mood (adjusted odds ratios [AOR] = 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.21-2.59 for men and AOR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.50-2.14 for women), disclosed suicide intent, left a suicide note, and used a firearm as suicide means. In CME/LE reports, pain and cancer were mentioned most frequently (29% and 28%, respectively). Dementia-related functional decline, fear of becoming a burden to loved ones, refusal of nursing homes, and loss of independence were also mentioned.
Study findings call for more targeted, intensive suicide prevention strategies for older adults suffering from debilitating and painful health conditions. Training health care providers and informal support systems to assess suicide risk and in evidence-based intervention plans/guidelines is needed.","['Burden', 'Cancer', 'Depression', 'Firearms', 'Nursing home', 'Pain']",The Gerontologist,2017-09-29,"[{'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Namkee G', 'initials': 'NG', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work.'}, {'lastname': 'DiNitto', 'firstname': 'Diana M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work.'}, {'lastname': 'Marti', 'firstname': 'C Nathan', 'initials': 'CN', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work.'}, {'lastname': 'Conwell', 'firstname': 'Yeates', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center, New York.'}]",,,"Physical health problems were recorded as a suicide precipitant for 50% of the older decedents.

25640203",Survival analysis of increases in care needs associated with dementia and living alone among older long-term care service users in Japan.,"Japan is known for its long life expectancy and rapidly aging society that there are various demands of older adults need to be fulfilled with, and one of them is long-term care needs. Therefore, Japan implemented the Long-Term Care Insurance in year 2000 for citizens who are above 65-year old and citizens who are above 40-year old in needs of long-term care services. This study was undertaken to longitudinally examine the influence of dementia and living alone on care needs increases among older long-term care insurance service users in Japan.
Long-term care insurance claims data were used to identify enrollees who applied for long-term care services between October 2010 and September 2011, and subjects were tracked until March 2015. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to examine increases in care needs over time in months. Cox regression models were used to examine the effects of dementia and living alone on care needs increases.
The cumulative survival rates before care needs increased over the 4.5-year observation period were 17.6% in the dementia group and 31.9% in the non-dementia group. After adjusting for age, sex, care needs level, and status of living alone, the risk of care needs increases was found to be 1.5 times higher in the dementia group. Living alone was not a significant risk factor of care needs increases, but people with dementia who lived alone had a higher risk of care needs increases than those without dementia.
Dementia, older age, the female sex, and lower care needs levels were associated with a higher risk of care needs increases over the study period. Among these variables, dementia had the strongest impact on care needs increases, especially in persons who lived alone.","['Care needs certification', 'Dementia', 'Living alone', 'Long-term care', 'Survival analysis']",BMC geriatrics,2017-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Huei-Ru', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': 'The Japan Foundation for Aging and Health, 4F, 1-1 Aza Gengoyama, Oaza Morioka, Higashiura-cho, Chita-gun, Aichi, 470-2101, Japan.\nDepartment of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Otsubo', 'firstname': 'Tetsuya', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Imanaka', 'firstname': 'Yuichi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan. imanaka-y@umin.net.'}]",,"Dementia, older age, the female sex, and lower care needs levels were associated with a higher risk of care needs increases over the study period.

16020772","Observational study of vascular dementia in the Spanish elderly population according to type 2 diabetes status: trends in incidence, characteristics and outcomes (2004-2013).","To examine trends overtime in the incidence and in-hospital outcomes of vascular dementia (VaD) hospitalisations in patients aged 70 years or over suffering and not suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between 2004 and 2013 in Spain.
Retrospective study.
Spain.
National hospital discharge data were used; patients aged ≥70, discharged from a hospital with VaD as a primary diagnosis, were selected.
Overall incidence, therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, comorbidities, infectious complications, duration of hospital stays and in-hospital mortality (IHM).
In total, 170 607 admissions for VaD (34.3% with T2DM) were identified. We found a significant upward linear trend in the incidence of VaD for men and women with and without diabetes between 2004 and 2013. The adjusted incidence was higher among people with T2DM over the study period. We found a higher incidence in men than women in all years under study. A positive association between T2DM and VaD hospitalisation was found among both men (IRR 2.14, 95% CI 2.11 to 2.16) and women (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.22; 95% CI 2.19 to 2.25). Pneumonia was significantly associated with a higher mortality (OR 2.59, 95% CI 2.52 to 2.67). We found that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was associated with lower IHM (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.45), while parenteral nutrition had the opposite effect (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41). There was no association between diabetes and higher IHM (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06). The time-trend analyses of the entire sample showed a significant reduction in mortality in patients with VaD (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99).
Incidence rates for VaD hospitalisations were twice as high in patients with diabetes compared with those without. Men had significantly higher incidence rates than women, regardless of diabetes status. In both groups studied, pneumonia and parenteral nutrition were associated with mortality while percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was associated with survival. Having diabetes was not associated with higher IHM after hospitalisation with VaD.","['hospitalization', 'in-hospital mortality', 'type 2 diabetes', 'vascular dementia']",BMJ open,2017-08-07,"[{'lastname': 'Muñoz-Rivas', 'firstname': 'Nuria', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Méndez-Bailón', 'firstname': 'Manuel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Miguel-Yanes', 'firstname': 'José M de', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Hernández-Barrera', 'firstname': 'Valentín', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Preventive Medicine and Public Health Teaching and Research Unit, Health Sciences Faculty, Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Miguel-Díez', 'firstname': 'Javier de', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Care, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Jimenez-Garcia', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Preventive Medicine and Public Health Teaching and Research Unit, Health Sciences Faculty, Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'López-de-Andrés', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Preventive Medicine and Public Health Teaching and Research Unit, Health Sciences Faculty, Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid, Spain.'}]",,,"In total, 170 607 admissions for VaD (34.3% with T2DM) were identified.

139,28747024,Clinical profile and outcomes in octogenarians with atrial fibrillation: A community-based study in a specific European health care area.,"Age increases risk of stroke and bleeding. Clinical trial data have had relatively low proportions of elderly subjects. We sought to study a Spanish population of octogenarians with atrial fibrillation (AF) by combining different sources of electronic clinical records from an area where all medical centres utilized electronic health record systems.
Data was derived from the Galician Healthcare Service information system.
From 383,000 subjects, AF was coded in 7990 (2.08%), 3640 (45.6%) of whom were ≥80 and 4350 (54.4%)<80. All CHA2DS2-VASc's components were more prevalent in the elderly except for diabetes. Of those ≥80, 2178 (59.8%) were women. Mean CHA
Octogenarians with AF had very different characteristics and outcomes from their younger counterparts. These results also provide reassurance about the effectiveness of OA in preventing TE events and maintaining a reasonable haemorrhagic event rate in the extremely elderly.","['Atrial fibrillation', 'Dementia', 'Octogenarian', 'Stroke']",International journal of cardiology,2017-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Mañero', 'firstname': 'Moisés', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cardiology Department, Complejo Hospital Universitario de Santiago, Santiago de Compostela, IDIS (Instituto para el Desarrollo e Integración de la Salud), CIBERCV (Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Cardiovasculares), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

22000269",Sex-dependent difference in the relationship between adipose-tissue cholesterol efflux and estradiol concentrations in young healthy humans.,"Impaired adipose tissue function and lower levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been implicated in the development of vascular dementia, and metabolic diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome. Interestingly, both the substrate fluxes in adipose tissue and HDL-C concentration differ between men and women. Moreover, adipose tissue cholesterol efflux has been implicated in modulation of HDL-C levels. Thus, we aimed to determine if the association between serum estradiol levels and adipose tissue cholesterol efflux is sex-dependent.
We evaluated the serum estradiol levels and adipose tissue cholesterol efflux in young healthy men (n=5) and women (n=3). Adipose tissue cholesterol efflux was determined using subcutaneous microdialysis probes. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between the parameters, p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Our data demonstrated that serum estradiol levels directly associated with adipose tissue cholesterol efflux; however, the relationships may be sex-dependent. We discussed our results in the context of currently available data regarding sex-dependent variability in adipose tissue function and HDL-C metabolism as a potential contributor to higher rates of vascular dementia in men.

141,28673434,Sexual Activity and Physical Tenderness in Older Adults: Cross-Sectional Prevalence and Associated Characteristics.,"Despite a common misconception, older adults engage in sexual behavior. However, there is limited sexual behavior research in older adults, which is often restricted to small samples, to cohorts recruiting adults from 45 years old, and to questions regarding only sexual intercourse.
To assess the cross-sectional prevalence of and characteristics associated with sexual activity and physical tenderness in community-dwelling older adults.
From the Rotterdam Study, sexual activity and physical tenderness were assessed in 2,374 dementia-free, community-dwelling men and women at least 65 years old from 2009 through 2012 in the Netherlands. Analyses were stratified by sex and partner status.
Sexual activity and physical tenderness (eg, fondling or kissing) in the last 6 months. Potential associated characteristics included measurements of demographics, socioeconomic position, health behavior, and health status.
The vast majority of partnered participants (men, n = 858; women, n = 724) had experienced physical tenderness in the previous 6 months (83.7% of men and 82.9% of women) and nearly half had engaged in sexual activity (49.5% and 40.4% respectively). Very few unpartnered women (n = 675) had engaged in sexual activity (1.3%) or physical tenderness (5.2%), whereas prevalence rates were slightly higher for unpartnered men (n = 117; 13.7% or 17.1%). Engaging in sexual behavior was generally associated with younger age, greater social support, healthier behaviors, and better physical and psychological health.
Findings show that older adults engage in sexual activity. It is important not to assume that an older person is not interested in sexual pleasure or that an older person is unhappy with not having a sexual partner. Offering an opportunity for open discussion of sexuality and medical assistance without imposing is a difficult balance. We encourage health care professionals to proactively address sexuality and extend knowledge about safe sex and sexual function to older adults.
Thus far, this is one of the largest samples of sexual behavior assessment in adults older than 60 years. Limitations of this study are common in sexual behavior research, including low sexual behavior engagement among unpartnered older adults and a small sample of unpartnered men, which restricted sex- and age-specific implications.
Almost half of partnered older adults engaged in sexual activity and more than two thirds engaged in physical tenderness, but very few unpartnered older adults engaged in these behaviors. The greatest barrier to being sexually active at an older age is lack of a partner, which particularly affects women. Sexuality is an important aspect of active aging.

142,28636895,Neurocognitive characteristics of youth with noncomorbid and comorbid forms of conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Studies investigating neurocognitive deficits in youth with conduct disorder (CD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often confounded by the high rates of comorbidity between the two.
Neurocognitive functioning was examined in three diagnostic groups (ADHD only, CD only, comorbid ADHD and CD) matched by age, sex, IQ, and medication status (n=28-32 per group).
No significant differences emerged between the diagnostic groups on measures of risk-taking or response inhibition.

143,28558375,The Determinants of Quality of Life of Nursing Home Residents with Young-Onset Dementia and the Differences between Dementia Subtypes.,"The aims of this study are to (1) explore the determinants of quality of life (QoL) in nursing home residents with young-onset dementia (YOD), (2) investigate whether there are differences between dementia subtypes (Alzheimer dementia, vascular/mixed dementia, frontotemporal dementia, other) regarding these determinants, and (3) compare QoL profiles of YOD nursing home residents across dementia subtypes.
This cross-sectional study included 207 nursing home residents. Multilevel modeling was used to determine the relationships between QoL and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), dementia severity, psychotropic drug use (PDU), dementia subtype, age, and gender. Additional multilevel models were used to compare aspects of QoL between dementia subtypes.
Residents' QoL was negatively associated with advanced dementia, PDU, and NPS. In general, the relationships between the determinants and QoL were similar across the dementia subtypes. Aspects of QoL differed by dementia subtype. Residents with frontotemporal dementia showed less negative emotions, accepted more help and experienced better quality of relationships with professional caregivers, had a more positive self-image, felt more comfortable in the nursing home environment, and experienced lower quality of social relationships.
Considering the high rates of NPS and PDU in YOD residents and their negative associations with QoL, we recommend emphasizing services to manage and reduce NPS and PDU in nursing home residents with YOD. Furthermore, our findings suggest accounting for differences in aspects of QoL by dementia subtype to address specific needs and thereby improve QoL.","['Neuropsychiatric symptoms', 'Nursing home', 'Psychotropic drugs', 'Quality of life', 'Young-onset dementia']",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,2017-05-31,"[{'lastname': 'Appelhof', 'firstname': 'Britt', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care and Public Health, Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen, Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakker', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Van Duinen-van den Ijssel', 'firstname': 'Jeannette C L', 'initials': 'JCL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zwijsen', 'firstname': 'Sandra A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Smalbrugge', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Verhey', 'firstname': 'Frans R J', 'initials': 'FRJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de Vugt', 'firstname': 'Marjolein E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zuidema', 'firstname': 'Sytse U', 'initials': 'SU', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koopmans', 'firstname': 'Raymond T C M', 'initials': 'RTCM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Residents' QoL was negatively associated with advanced dementia, PDU, and NPS.

1885862",Age of Migration Differentials in Life Expectancy With Cognitive Impairment: 20-Year Findings From the Hispanic-EPESE.,"To examine differences in life expectancy with cognitive impairment among older Mexican adults according to nativity (U.S.-born/foreign-born) and among immigrants, age of migration to the United States.
This study employs 20 years of data from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly to estimate the proportion of life spent cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired prior to death among older Mexican adults residing in the southwestern United States. We combine age-specific mortality rates with age-specific prevalence of cognitive impairment, defined as a Mini-Mental Status Exam score of less than 21 points to calculate Sullivan-based life table models with and without cognitive impairment in later life.
Foreign-born Mexican immigrants have longer total life expectancy and comparable cognitive healthy life expectancy regardless of gender compared to U.S.-born Mexican-Americans. However, the foreign-born spend a greater number of years after age 65 with cognitive impairment relative to their U.S.-born counterparts. Furthermore, we document an advantage in life expectancy with cognitive impairment and proportion of years after age 65 cognitively healthy among mid-life immigrant men and women relative to early- and late-life migrants.
The relationship between nativity, age of migration, and life expectancy with cognitive impairment means that the foreign-born are in more need of support and time-intensive care in late life. This issue merits special attention to develop appropriate and targeted screening efforts that reduce cognitive decline for diverse subgroups of older Mexican-origin adults as they age.",[],The Gerontologist,2017-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Garcia', 'firstname': 'Marc A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston.'}, {'lastname': 'Saenz', 'firstname': 'Joseph L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'University of Southern California, Davis School of Gerontology, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Downer', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston.'}, {'lastname': 'Chiu', 'firstname': 'Chi-Tsun', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': 'Institute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Rote', 'firstname': 'Sunshine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Louisville, Kent School of Social Work, Kentucky.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Rebeca', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Sealy Center of Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston.'}]",,,"Foreign-born Mexican immigrants have longer total life expectancy and comparable cognitive healthy life expectancy regardless of gender compared to U.S.-born Mexican-Americans.

Retrospective cohort study.
National Health and Aging Trends Study, 2011-2015.
U.S. adults aged 65 and older with ADL disability and a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 kg/m
Obese with disabilities had lower rates of receiving assistance with walking inside (odds ratio (OR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.81), walking outside (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.97), toileting (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.52-0.89), and getting in and out of bed (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.50-0.87) than normal-weight older adults after adjustment for respondent demographic characteristics. Level of need and cognitive status partially explained the associations. In fully adjusted models, older adults with obesity still had significantly lower odds of receiving assistance in getting in and out of bed than normal weight adults (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.49-0.98).
Older adults with obesity are less likely to receive assistance for ADL disabilities than their normal-weight counterparts-an important concern because of ongoing demographic changes in the United States.","['aging', 'caregiving', 'disability', 'obesity']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2017-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Ankuda', 'firstname': 'Claire K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nDepartment of Family Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.'}, {'lastname': 'Ornstein', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Brookdale Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Levine', 'firstname': 'Deborah A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nVeterans Affairs Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nInstitute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Langa', 'firstname': 'Kenneth M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nVeterans Affairs Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nInstitute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nInstitute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelley', 'firstname': 'Amy S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Brookdale Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, New York.'}]",,Older adults with obesity are less likely to receive assistance for ADL disabilities than their normal-weight counterparts-an important concern because of ongoing demographic changes in the United States.,"Obese with disabilities had lower rates of receiving assistance with walking inside (odds ratio (OR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.81), walking outside (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.97), toileting (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.52-0.89), and getting in and out of bed (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.50-0.87) than normal-weight older adults after adjustment for respondent demographic characteristics.

146,28416129,Increase in Parkinson's disease-related mortality among males in Northern Italy.,"According to standard mortality statistics based on the underlying cause of death (UCOD), mortality from Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing in most European countries. However, mortality trends are better investigated taking into account all the diseases reported in the death certificate (multiple causes of death approach, MCOD).
All deaths of residents in the Veneto Region (Northern Italy) aged≥45 years with any mention of PD were extracted from 2008 to 2015. The Annual Percent Change (APC) in age-standardized mortality rates was computed both for PD as the UCOD, and by MCOD. The association with common chronic comorbidities and acute complications was investigated by log-binomial regression. The frequency of the mention of PD in death certificates was investigated through linkage with an archive of patients with a previous clinical diagnosis of the disease.
PD was reported in 2.1% of all deaths, rising from 1.9% in 2008 to 2.4% in 2015. Among males, age-standardized rates increased over time both in analyses based on the UCOD (APC +4.1%; Confidence Interval +1.5%,+6.7%), and on MCOD (APC +2.2%; +0.2,+4.2%). Among females time trends were not significant. Mention of PD was associated with that of dementia/Alzheimer and acute infectious diseases. Among known PD patients, the disease was reported only in 60.2% of death certificates.
Mortality associated to PD is steeply increasing among males in Northern Italy; further investigations on time trends for PD, both through all available electronic health archives and clinical studies, should be set as a priority for epidemiological research.","['Epidemiology', 'Mortality', ""Parkinon's disease""]",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2017-04-19,"[{'lastname': 'Fedeli', 'firstname': 'Ugo', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiological Department, Veneto Region, Italy.

12861916",Characteristics and Incidence of Traumatic Brain Injury in Older Adults Using Home Care in Ontario from 2003-2013.,"Describe the characteristics and determine the annual cumulative incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older adults receiving home care in Ontario from 2003 to 2013.
A retrospective cohort study of longitudinal data from the Ontario Association of Community Care Access Centers (N = 554,313). TBI, demographic variables, depression, neurological conditions, and recent falls were measured from the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care. Comparisons were made between service users with and without TBI using odds ratios. Standardized incidence rates were calculated and the 10-year trend of annual cumulative incidence rates was examined.
Characteristics associated with TBI: male sex (OR: 1.54), aboriginal origin (OR: 1.98), increasing age (low of OR: 1.22, in 70-74 years; high of OR: 2.31, in 90 years and older; comparison 65-69 years), being widowed (OR: 1.59), having one or more falls (OR: 2.31), the use of antidepressants (OR: 1.49) and the presence of depression (OR: 1.57), dementia (OR: 1.65), hemiplegia (OR: 4.34), multiple sclerosis (OR: 3.19) or parkinsonism (OR: 1.22). TBI incidence was significantly higher than rates previously reported in the literature. There was no change in the overall annual cumulative incidence over the 10-year period (
Certain demographic characteristics, neurological diseases, antidepressant use, and a recent fall are associated with TBI. Incidence of TBI is higher than previous estimates and the overall incidence is not changing over time. These results can be used to improve care of the elderly and to generate hypotheses for future research regarding TBI in the home care setting.","['TBI', 'aged', 'cohort']",Canadian geriatrics journal : CGJ,2017-04-12,"[{'lastname': 'McGuire', 'firstname': 'Connor', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kristman', 'firstname': 'Vicki L', 'initials': 'VL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Health Sciences, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada; Institute for Work & Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Division of Epidemiology, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada; Centre for Applied Health Research, St. Joseph's Care Group, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Lynn', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bédard', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Health Sciences, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada; Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada; Centre for Applied Health Research, St. Joseph's Care Group, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada, Canada; Centre for Research on Safe Driving, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.""}]",,,"Characteristics associated with TBI: male sex (OR: 1.54), aboriginal origin (OR: 1.98), increasing age (low of OR: 1.22, in 70-74 years; high of OR: 2.31, in 90 years and older; comparison 65-69 years), being widowed (OR: 1.59), having one or more falls (OR: 2.31), the use of antidepressants (OR: 1.49) and the presence of depression (OR: 1.57), dementia (OR: 1.65), hemiplegia (OR: 4.34), multiple sclerosis (OR: 3.19) or parkinsonism (OR: 1.22).

17690596",Drug Utilization of Japanese Patients Diagnosed with Schizophrenia: An Administrative Database Analysis.,"Patient characteristics require consideration for optimal treatment in order to achieve clinical remission for an improved quality of life and social functioning. Prior evidence supports long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) in the relapse prevention of schizophrenia. This study aimed to characterize Japanese patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and to compare the outcomes of LAIs and oral antipsychotics (AP) in re-hospitalization or emergency room visit rates.
Diagnostic Procedure Combination (DPC) designated hospital data in Japan with ICD-10 code F20x between July 2013 and June 2015 were obtained from the Medical Data Vision Co. Ltd. Patients were divided into sub-groups in order to filter co-diagnostic conditions. Differences across sub-groups were assessed using a Chi square test or ANOVA. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was calculated to compare the re-hospitalization (30 days post discharge) or emergency room visit rates between pharmacotherapy groups of oral versus LAI or typical versus atypical within LAI patients. Adjusted estimates were provided by propensity scores that were assigned for age, gender, and Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) scores.
A quarter of the data sourced were attributed to co-diagnosis with dementia/delirium with antipsychotic prescriptions despite reported risks of antipsychotic use. After adjusting for age, gender, and co-morbidity, LAI reduced re-hospitalization and emergency (ER) visit rates more than oral APs (LAI vs. oral IRR = 0.38 (95% CI 0.17-0.74), IRR = 0.56 (95% CI 0.34-0.91), respectively).
The study findings demonstrate usage of DPC hospital data in schizophrenia pharmacotherapy based on classification of co-diagnoses. In comparison with oral APs only, LAI utilization can provide an opportunity for reduced re-hospitalization and ER visit rates among patients with schizophrenia.",[],Clinical drug investigation,2017-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cheung', 'firstname': 'Stephane', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Kwansei Gakuin University, Nishinomiya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamuro', 'firstname': 'Yukinobu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Kwansei Gakuin University, Nishinomiya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahlich', 'firstname': 'Jörg', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics (DICE), University of Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany. joerg.mahlich@gmail.com.\nHealth Economics, Janssen Pharmaceutical KK, Tokyo, Japan. joerg.mahlich@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakahara', 'firstname': 'Takanobu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Senshu University, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sruamsiri', 'firstname': 'Rosarin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Health Economics, Janssen Pharmaceutical KK, Tokyo, Japan.\nCenter of Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsukazawa', 'firstname': 'Sunny', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Health Economics, Janssen Pharmaceutical KK, Tokyo, Japan.'}]",,"The study findings demonstrate usage of DPC hospital data in schizophrenia pharmacotherapy based on classification of co-diagnoses.

149,28334939,Association between tau deposition and antecedent amyloid-β accumulation rates in normal and early symptomatic individuals.,"See Vandenberghe and Schaeverbeke (doi:10.1093/awx065) for a scientific commentary on this article. A long-term goal of our field is to determine the sequence of pathological events, which ultimately lead to cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we first assessed the patterns of brain tau tangle accumulation (measured with the positron emission tomography tracer 18F-AV-1451) associated with well-established Alzheimer's disease factors in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. We then explored highly associated patterns of greater 18F-AV-1451 binding and increased annualized change in cortical amyloid-β plaques measured as florbetapir positron emission tomography binding antecedent to 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, and to what extent these multimodal pattern associations explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independently and jointly. We found that: (i) 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention was differentially associated with age, and cross-sectional florbetapir positron emission tomography retention, but not with years of education, gender, or APOE genotype; (ii) increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, in the parieto-temporal and precuneus brain regions was associated with greater 18F-AV-1451 PET retention most prominently in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the full cohort, with florbetapir positive/negative-associated variability; and (iii) this 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention pattern significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independent of the associated antecedent increased annualized change in florbetapir positron emission tomography retention. These findings are in agreement with the pathology literature, which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloid-β plaques correlate with cognition and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, non-local associations linking increased amyloid-β accumulation rates with increased tau deposition are of great interest and support the idea that the amyloid-β pathology might have remote effects in disease pathology spread potentially via the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'amyloid-β', 'positron emission tomography', 'tau']",Brain : a journal of neurology,2017-03-24,"[{'lastname': 'Tosun', 'firstname': 'Duygu', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California - San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Landau', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aisen', 'firstname': 'Paul S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California-San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersen', 'firstname': 'Ronald C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mintun', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jagust', 'firstname': 'William', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Weiner', 'firstname': 'Michael W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California - San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"© The Author (2017).

25968174","Potentially modifiable lifestyle factors, cognitive reserve, and cognitive function in later life: A cross-sectional study.","Potentially modifiable lifestyle factors may influence cognitive health in later life and offer potential to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The concept of cognitive reserve has been proposed as a mechanism to explain individual differences in rates of cognitive decline, but its potential role as a mediating pathway has seldom been explored using data from large epidemiological studies. We explored the mediating effect of cognitive reserve on the cross-sectional association between lifestyle factors and cognitive function in later life using data from a population-based cohort of healthy older people.
We analysed data from 2,315 cognitively healthy participants aged 65 y and over in the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study Wales (CFAS-Wales) cohort collected in 2011-2013. Linear regression modelling was used to investigate the overall associations between five lifestyle factors-cognitive and social activity, physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking-and cognition, adjusting for demographic factors and chronic conditions. Mediation analysis tested for indirect effects of the lifestyle factors on cognition via cognitive reserve. After controlling for age, gender, and the presence of chronic conditions, cognitive and social activity, physical activity, healthy diet, and light-to-moderate alcohol consumption were positively associated with cognitive function, together accounting for 20% (95% CI 17%-23%) of variance in cognitive test scores. Cognitive reserve was an important mediator of this association, with indirect effects via cognitive reserve contributing 21% (95% CI 15%-27%) of the overall effect on cognition. The main limitations of the study derive from the cross-sectional nature of the data and the challenges of accurately measuring the latent construct of cognitive reserve.
Cross-sectional associations support the view that enhancing cognitive reserve may benefit cognition, and maintenance of cognitive health may be supported by a healthy and active lifestyle, in later life.",[],PLoS medicine,2017-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Clare', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health (REACH), School of Psychology, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nPenCLAHRC, Institute of Health Research, University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nCentre for Research Excellence in Promoting Cognitive Health, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yu-Tzu', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health (REACH), School of Psychology, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nPenCLAHRC, Institute of Health Research, University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Teale', 'firstname': 'Julia C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health (REACH), School of Psychology, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nPenCLAHRC, Institute of Health Research, University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'MacLeod', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Dementia Services Development Centre Wales, School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Matthews', 'firstname': 'Fiona', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Health and Society, Faculty of Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom.\nMRC Biostatistics Unit, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Brayne', 'firstname': 'Carol', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Woods', 'firstname': 'Bob', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Dementia Services Development Centre Wales, School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pmed.1002259

151,28295599,Gender difference in the association and presentation of visual hallucinations in dementia with Lewy bodies: a cross-sectional study.,"Visual hallucinations (VHs) are among the most striking features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We investigated gender differences in the association and presentation of VHs in DLB.
A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a prospective, longitudinal study on dementia was performed. Cumulative frequency, 1-month frequency, and phenomenology of VHs were summarized and compared between female and male patients with DLB. Gender differences in the factors associated with VHs were investigated in patients with and without hallucinations.
A total of 152 patients including 65 (42.8%) women and 87 (57.2%) men were analyzed. The cumulative and 1-month frequencies of VHs were 60% and 55.4%, respectively, in women and 44.8% and 41.4%, respectively, in men. Adjusting for age and disease severity resulted in the inclusion of more women in the VH group [odds ratio (OR) = 2.33, p = 0.028)] than in the non-VH group. In female participants, older age (OR = 9.16, p = 0.003) and higher neuropsychiatric inventory score (OR = 4.89, p = 0.009) were associated with VHs, whereas in male participants, more severe dementia stage (clinical dementia rating 2-3 versus clinical dementia rating 0.5, OR = 6.22, p = 0.008) and higher rates of using antipsychotics (OR = 9.64, p = 0.047) were associated with VHs.
The frequencies of 1-month and cumulative VHs were high in DLB, which indicated a high prevalence as well as a high persistency of VHs in DLB. The patterns of factors associated with VHs differed between female and male patients.

29090168",Association of comorbidity and health service usage among patients with dementia in the UK: a population-based study.,"The majority of people with dementia have other long-term diseases, the presence of which may affect the progression and management of dementia. This study aimed to identify subgroups with higher healthcare needs, by analysing how primary care consultations, number of prescriptions and hospital admissions by people with dementia varies with having additional long-term diseases (comorbidity).
A retrospective cohort study based on health data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) was conducted. Incident cases of dementia diagnosed in the year starting 1/3/2008 were selected and followed for up to 5 years. The number of comorbidities was obtained from a set of 34 chronic health conditions. Service usage (primary care consultations, hospitalisations and prescriptions) and time-to-death were determined during follow-up. Multilevel negative binomial regression and Cox regression, adjusted for age and gender, were used to model differences in service usage and death between differing numbers of comorbidities.
Data from 4999 people (14 866 person-years of follow-up) were analysed. Overall, 91.7% of people had 1 or more additional comorbidities. Compared with those with 2 or 3 comorbidities, people with ≥6 comorbidities had higher rates of primary care consultations (rate ratio (RR) 1.31, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.36), prescriptions (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.81), and hospitalisation (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.83), and higher risk of death (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.78).
In the UK, people with dementia with higher numbers of comorbidities die earlier and have considerably higher health service usage in terms of primary care consultations, hospital admissions and prescribing. This study provides strong evidence that comorbidity is a key factor that should be considered when allocating resources and planning care for people with dementia.","['HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION & MANAGEMENT', 'PRIMARY CARE', 'Service Use', 'comorbidity', 'multimorbidity']",BMJ open,2017-03-11,"[{'lastname': 'Browne', 'firstname': 'Jorge', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\nPrimary Care Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Edwards', 'firstname': 'Duncan A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Primary Care Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\nGrove Lane Surgery, Thetford and National Institute for Health Research Doctoral Research Fellow at Primary Care Unit, University of Cambridge, Worts Causeway Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rhodes', 'firstname': 'Kirsty M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Grove Lane Surgery, Thetford and National Institute for Health Research Doctoral Research Fellow at Primary Care Unit, University of Cambridge, Worts Causeway Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Brimicombe', 'firstname': 'D James', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Primary Care Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\nPrimary Care Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Payne', 'firstname': 'Rupert A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Primary Care Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\nCentre for Academic Primary Care, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}]",,,"Data from 4999 people (14 866 person-years of follow-up) were analysed.

153,28276861,Screening for dementia in Arabic: normative data from an elderly Lebanese sample.,"Prevention and treatment of dementia is a global concern that requires involvement of international samples. The purpose of this study is to develop culturally sensitive norms based on normal older Lebanese adults using multiple cognitive screening measures translated into Arabic for regional use.
Participants were 164 community dwelling older Lebanese adults without cognitive complaints. They were administered the following cognitive measures in Arabic: Alzheimer's Disease 8-item questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini Mental Status Exam, Modified Mini Mental Status, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised, Lebanese Digit Span, Cross-Linguistic Naming Test, and phonemic and semantic fluency tests.
Sample characteristics and descriptive statistics for the demographically unadjusted raw scores are first presented (N = 164). Same-form test-retest reliability for each test were computed for 24 participants retested over 2-5 weeks, with reliabilities ranging from .55 to .90; Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged from .34 to .93. Two sets of normative data were constructed. First, base-rates for demographically unadjusted raw scores for the 5th, 10th and 15th percentiles are presented to identify relatively rare occurring performances. Second, using standardized regression-based procedures demographically corrected normative information adjusted for age, education and sex were generated for normative interpretation.
Adapting cognitive tests for use in culturally and linguistically diverse regions of the world not only requires careful translation of test instructions and materials, but construction of culturally sensitive local norms. Our normative data should allow for more accurate identification of cognitive impairment and dementia in Arabic-speaking patients, especially those living in Lebanon.","['Arabic', 'Cross-cultural', 'Lebanon', 'cognitive screening', 'dementia', 'normative data', 'regression-based norms']",The Clinical neuropsychologist,2017-03-10,"[{'lastname': 'Abou-Mrad', 'firstname': 'Fadi', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'a Faculty of Medical Sciences , Lebanese University , Hadath , Lebanon.\nb Memory Clinic, Division of Neurology , Saint Charles Hospital , Fayadieh , Lebanon.'}, {'lastname': 'Chelune', 'firstname': 'Gordon', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""c Center for Alzheimer's Care, Imaging, and Research , University of Utah , USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Zamrini', 'firstname': 'Edward', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""c Center for Alzheimer's Care, Imaging, and Research , University of Utah , USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Tarabey', 'firstname': 'Lubna', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'a Faculty of Medical Sciences , Lebanese University , Hadath , Lebanon.\nb Memory Clinic, Division of Neurology , Saint Charles Hospital , Fayadieh , Lebanon.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayek', 'firstname': 'Maryse', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'd Faculty of Medicine , St Joseph University (USJ) , Beirut , Lebanon.\ne Lebanon Memory Group for Clinical Research , GMRC-Liban , Beirut , Lebanon.'}, {'lastname': 'Fadel', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'd Faculty of Medicine , St Joseph University (USJ) , Beirut , Lebanon.\ne Lebanon Memory Group for Clinical Research , GMRC-Liban , Beirut , Lebanon.'}]",,,"Sample characteristics and descriptive statistics for the demographically unadjusted raw scores are first presented (N = 164).

154,28181629,"Comorbidity and polypharmacy in people with dementia: insights from a large, population-based cross-sectional analysis of primary care data.","The care of older people with dementia is often complicated by physical comorbidity and polypharmacy, but the extent and patterns of these have not been well described. This paper reports analysis of these factors within a large, cross-sectional primary care data set.
Data were extracted for 291,169 people aged 65 years or older registered with 314 general practices in the UK, of whom 10,258 had an electronically recorded dementia diagnosis. Differences in the number and type of 32 physical conditions and the number of repeat prescriptions in those with and without dementia were examined. Age–gender standardised rates were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) of physical comorbidity and polypharmacy.
People with dementia, after controlling for age and sex, had on average more physical conditions than controls (mean number of conditions 2.9 versus 2.4; P < 0.001) and were on more repeat medication (mean number of repeats 5.4 versus 4.2; P < 0.001). Those with dementia were more likely to have 5 or more physical conditions (age–sex standardised OR [sOR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35–1.50; P < 0.001) and were also more likely to be on 5 or more (sOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.40–1.52; P < 0.001) or 10 or more repeat prescriptions (sOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.90–2.12; P < 0.001).
People with dementia have a higher burden of comorbid physical disease and polypharmacy than those without dementia, even after accounting for age and sex differences.

27134606",Sex and Race Differences in the Association Between Statin Use and the Incidence of Alzheimer Disease.,"To our knowledge, no effective treatments exist for Alzheimer disease, and new molecules are years away. However, several drugs prescribed for other conditions have been associated with reducing its risk.
To analyze the association between statin exposure and Alzheimer disease incidence among Medicare beneficiaries.
We examined the medical and pharmacy claims of a 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 to 2013 and compared rates of Alzheimer disease diagnosis for 399 979 statin users 65 years of age or older with high or low exposure to statins and with drug molecules for black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white people, and men and women of Asian, Native American, or unkown race/ethnicity who are referred to as ""other.""
The main outcome was incident diagnosis of Alzheimer disease based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. We used Cox proportional hazard models to analyze the association between statin exposure and Alzheimer disease diagnosis for different sexes, races and ethnicities, and statin molecules.
The 399 979 study participants included 7794 (1.95%) black men, 24 484 (6.12%) black women, 11 200 (2.80%) Hispanic men, 21 458 (5.36%) Hispanic women, 115 059 (28.77%) white men, and 195 181 (48.80%) white women. High exposure to statins was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer disease diagnosis for women (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.89; P<.001) and men (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.93; P<.001). Simvastatin was associated with lower Alzheimer disease risk for white women (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.92; P<.001), white men (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99; P=.02), Hispanic women (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.99; P=.04), Hispanic men (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91; P=.01), and black women (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.93; P=.005). Atorvastatin was associated with a reduced risk of incident Alzheimer disease diagnosis for white women (HR, 0.84, 95% CI, 0.78-0.89), black women (HR, 0.81, 95% CI, 0.67-0.98), and Hispanic men (HR, 0.61, 95% CI, 0.42-0.89) and women (HR, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.60-0.97). Pravastatin and rosuvastatin were associated with reduced Alzheimer disease risk for white women only (HR, 0.82, 95% CI, 0.70-0.95 and HR, 0.81, 95% CI, 0.67-0.98, respectively). High statin exposure was not associated with a statistically significant lower Alzheimer disease risk among black men.
The reduction in Alzheimer disease risk varied across statin molecules, sex, and race/ethnicity. Clinical trials that include racial and ethnic groups need to confirm these findings. Because statins may affect Alzheimer disease risk, physicians should consider which statin is prescribed to each patient.",[],JAMA neurology,2016-12-13,"[{'lastname': 'Zissimopoulos', 'firstname': 'Julie M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Leonard D.

157,27883994,Monitoring Huntington's Disease Mortality across a 30-Year Period: Geographic and Temporal Patterns.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by chorea, dystonia, behavioral disturbances and cognitive decline. The aim of this study is to assess temporal and spatial changes on mortality attributable to HD over 30 years in Spain.
HD data were extracted from the nationwide mortality registry for the period 1984-2013. Annual and 5-year gender- and age-specific rates adjusted for the standard European population were calculated. Geographic analysis was performed by districts from 1999 through 2013, and then estimated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and smoothed SMRs.
There were 1,556 HD-related deaths across the study period. An increasing trend in age-adjusted HD mortality was in evidence, specifically from 1994 through 1998. On a year-by-year basis, age-adjusted mortality rates increased from 0.076 per 100,000 population in 1984 to 0.157 in 2013. Geographical differences among districts were evident in specific areas and in the southwest of Spain with a significantly higher HD mortality risk.
HD mortality rising trends in Spain might be attributable to improvements in diagnosis leading to a rise in prevalence. Geographical variability in HD mortality could be related to regional differences in disease prevalence, health-care disparities, or other factors which call for in-depth assessment in future studies.",[],Neuroepidemiology,2016-11-25,"[{'lastname': 'Sánchez-Díaz', 'firstname': 'Germán', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Rare Diseases Research, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Arias-Merino', 'firstname': 'Greta', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Villaverde-Hueso', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morales-Piga', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Abaitua-Borda', 'firstname': 'Ignacio', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hens', 'firstname': 'Manuel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bermejo-Sánchez', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Posada de la Paz', 'firstname': 'Manuel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Alonso-Ferreira', 'firstname': 'Verónica', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}]",,"HD mortality rising trends in Spain might be attributable to improvements in diagnosis leading to a rise in prevalence.

22810410",Cause-Specific Mortality Trends Following Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty.,"While studies have demonstrated that mortality after total hip (THA) and total knee (TKA) arthroplasty is better than the general population, the causes of death are not well established. We evaluated cause-specific mortality after THA and TKA.
The study included population-based cohorts of patients who underwent THA (N = 2019) and TKA (N = 2259) between 1969 and 2008. Causes of death were classified using the International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th editions. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by comparing observed and expected mortality. Expected mortality was derived from mortality rates in the United States white population of similar calendar year, age, and sex characteristics.
All-cause mortality was lower than expected following both THA and TKA. However, there was excess mortality due to mental diseases such as dementia following both THA (SMR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08, 1.80) and TKA (SMR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19, 1.85). There was also excess mortality from inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases in THA (SMR 3.50, 95% CI 2.11, 5.46) and TKA (SMR 4.85, 95% CI 3.29, 6.88). When the cohorts were restricted to patients with osteoarthritis as the surgical indication, the excess risk of death from mental diseases still persisted in THA (SMR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02, 1.78) and TKA (SMR 1.52, 95% CI 1.20, 1.91).
THA and TKA patients experience a higher risk of death from mental and inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases.

Observational data extracted from clinical records using natural language processing and Hospital Episode Statistics. Statistical analyses examined effects of cognition, physical health, mental health, sociodemographic factors and living circumstances on risk of admission to care home or hospital over 6 months and associated costs, adjusting for repeated observations.
Catchment area for South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, provider for 1.2 million people in Southeast London.
Every individual with diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease seen and treated by mental health services in the catchment area, with at least one rating of cognition, not resident in care home at time of assessment (n=3075).
Usual treatment.
Risk of admission to, and days spent in three settings during 6-month period following routine clinical assessment: care home, mental health inpatient care and general hospital inpatient care.
Predictors of probability of care home or hospital admission and/or associated costs over 6 months include cognition, functional problems, agitation, depression, physical illness, previous hospitalisations, age, gender, ethnicity, living alone and having a partner. Patterns of association differed considerably by destination.
Most people with dementia prefer to remain in their own homes, and funding bodies see this as cheaper than institutionalisation. Better treatment in the community that reduces health and social care needs of Alzheimer's patients would reduce admission rates. Living alone, poor living circumstances and functional problems all raise admission rates, and so major cuts in social care budgets increase the risk of high-cost admissions which older people do not want.

12482085",Female advantage in verbal memory: Evidence of sex-specific cognitive reserve.,"We investigated sex differences in verbal memory across different levels of neural dysfunction, measured by temporal lobe glucose metabolic rates (TLGluMR).
Three hundred ninety controls and 672 participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 254 with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and [
Across groups, female sex and higher TLGluMR and their interaction were associated with better verbal memory (p values ≤ 0.005). The female advantage in verbal memory varied by TLGluMR such that the advantage was greatest among individuals with moderate to high TLGluMR and minimal or absent among individuals with lower TLGluMR. Diagnosis-stratified analyses revealed that this interaction was driven by the aMCI group (p values = 0.009). The interaction was not significant in control and AD dementia groups.
Women show better verbal memory than men in aMCI despite similar levels of brain hypometabolism. The lifelong advantage that females show over males in verbal memory might represent a form of cognitive reserve that delays verbal memory decline until more advanced pathology, as indexed by TLGluMR. This issue is clinically important because verbal memory scores are used in diagnosing aMCI and AD dementia.",[],Neurology,2016-11-02,"[{'lastname': 'Sundermann', 'firstname': 'Erin E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'From the Einstein Aging Study and the Department of Neurology (E.E.S., R.B.L.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; Department of Psychiatry (P.M.M., L.H.R.), University of Illinois at Chicago; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (S.L.), University of California, Berkeley; and Department of Neurology (A.B.), State University of New York, Stony Brook. erin.sundermann@einstein.yu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Maki', 'firstname': 'Pauline M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'From the Einstein Aging Study and the Department of Neurology (E.E.S., R.B.L.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; Department of Psychiatry (P.M.M., L.H.R.), University of Illinois at Chicago; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (S.L.), University of California, Berkeley; and Department of Neurology (A.B.), State University of New York, Stony Brook.'}, {'lastname': 'Rubin', 'firstname': 'Leah H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'From the Einstein Aging Study and the Department of Neurology (E.E.S., R.B.L.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; Department of Psychiatry (P.M.M., L.H.R.), University of Illinois at Chicago; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (S.L.), University of California, Berkeley; and Department of Neurology (A.B.), State University of New York, Stony Brook.'}, {'lastname': 'Lipton', 'firstname': 'Richard B', 'initials': 'RB', 'affiliation': 'From the Einstein Aging Study and the Department of Neurology (E.E.S., R.B.L.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; Department of Psychiatry (P.M.M., L.H.R.), University of Illinois at Chicago; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (S.L.), University of California, Berkeley; and Department of Neurology (A.B.), State University of New York, Stony Brook.'}, {'lastname': 'Landau', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'From the Einstein Aging Study and the Department of Neurology (E.E.S., R.B.L.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; Department of Psychiatry (P.M.M., L.H.R.), University of Illinois at Chicago; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (S.L.), University of California, Berkeley; and Department of Neurology (A.B.), State University of New York, Stony Brook.'}, {'lastname': 'Biegon', 'firstname': 'Anat', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'From the Einstein Aging Study and the Department of Neurology (E.E.S., R.B.L.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; Department of Psychiatry (P.M.M., L.H.R.), University of Illinois at Chicago; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (S.L.), University of California, Berkeley; and Department of Neurology (A.B.), State University of New York, Stony Brook.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Across groups, female sex and higher TLGluMR and their interaction were associated with better verbal memory (p values ≤ 0.005).

15316673",What Are the Risk Factors for Dislocation of Hip Bipolar Hemiarthroplasty Through the Anterolateral Approach? A Nested Case-control Study.,"Hip dislocation after treatment of a femoral neck fracture with a hemiarthroplasty remains an important problem in the treatment of hip fractures, but the associations between patient factors and surgical factors, and how these factors contribute to dislocation in patients who have undergone bipolar hemiarthroplasty through an anterolateral approach for femoral neck fracture currently are only poorly characterized.
We evaluated patients with bipolar hemiarthroplasty dislocation after surgery for femoral neck fracture treated through an anterolateral approach and asked: (1) What are the frequency, characteristics, and risk factors of bipolar hemiarthroplasty dislocations? (2) What are the frequency, characteristics, and risk factors of bipolar hemiarthroplasty dissociations?
A review of hospital records for patients who underwent bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture at one hospital between July 2004 and August 2014 was conducted. During that time, 1428 patients were admitted with a diagnosis of femoral neck fracture; 508 of these patients underwent bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty, of whom 61 died and 23 were lost to followup during the first year, leaving 424 (83%) available for analysis. The remainder of the patients during that time were treated with internal fixation (512), unipoloar hip arthroplasty (17), or THA (391). For each patient with dislocation, we selected five control patients from the cohort according to sex, age (± 3 years), and year of entry in the study to eliminate some confounding factors. We recorded patient characteristics regarding demographics, medical comorbidities, Katz score, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and anesthesia type. Medical comorbidities included diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, heart disease, neuromuscular diseases, and dementia. Univariate analyses were used to search for possible risk factors. Conditional logistic regression analyses on dislocation or dissociation were performed to estimate hazard rates (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs with covariates of a probability less than 0.1 in univariate analysis.
In this cohort, there were 26 dislocations including four that were also dissociations. The proportion of patients experiencing a dislocation was 6% (26 of 424). The mean interval from surgery to dislocation was 56 weeks (range, 0-433 weeks), and 18 dislocations (69%) occurred within 3 months after surgery. Three variables were independently associated with an increased risk of hip dislocation: dementia (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.19-10.38; p = 0.02), discrepancy of offset (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.15-2.58; p = 0.008), and lower MMSE score (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98; p = 0.007). The proportion of patients experiencing a dissociation was 0.9% (four of 424). The result of conditional logistic regression for dissociation showed that cup size smaller than 43 mm was the risk factor (HR = 513.05). However, there was no statistical difference with the probability equaling 0.47.
After the anterolateral approach for treatment of femoral neck fracture using bipolar hemiarthroplasty, 6% of hips dislocated and 0.9% experienced dissociation. Cognitive dysfunction and discrepancy of offset were independent risk factors associated with an increased risk of prosthetic dislocation. The small cup without a safety ring may be the risk factor of dissociation. Discrepancy of offset should be avoided during the operation by performing an accurate femoral osteotomy and choosing an adequate femoral stem neck length. For patients with cognitive dysfunction and a small cup, suturing the joint capsule during the operation and reinforcing protective measures after surgery might reduce the occurrence of dislocation and dissociation, however a study addressing this is necessary to confirm this.

19101585",Traditional Chinese medicine therapy decreases the pneumonia risk in patients with dementia.,"Pneumonia is a frequent complication in dementia patients and is associated with high mortality rates. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine whether traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy can decrease pneumonia risk in dementia patients. The cohort dataset was obtained from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005, a sublibrary of the National Health Insurance Research Database, containing all medical data of 1 million beneficiaries, randomly selected from the all Insurers in year 2005.Newly diagnosed dementia patients (n = 9712) without pneumonia were analyzed from January 1997 to December 2003. After matching by sex, age, urban level, Charlson comorbidity index, insured amount, and comorbidities, 1376 pairs (1:1) of TCM and non-TCM users were acquired. Every dementia patient was individually recorded from 1997 to 2012 to identify pneumonia incidence (onset after 3 months of dementia diagnosis).Demographic characteristics, Charlson comorbidity index, comorbidities, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and psychotropic drugs were also investigated. Cox proportional regression was used to compute hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjustment for the above-mentioned variables.There were 419 (30.5%) and 762 (55.4%) pneumonia cases in the TCM and non-TCM cohorts during a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for pneumonia admission was 0.62 (0.55-0.70) for the TCM group.Patients who received TCM therapy at higher cumulative doses or for longer periods experienced increased protection from pneumonia admission. Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang, Yin-Qiao-San, and Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang might represent possible formulae reducing the incidence of pneumonia. TCM might be associated with a lower risk of pneumonia in dementia patients.",[],Medicine,2016-09-16,"[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Shun-Ku', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chinese Medicine, Taipei City Hospital, Renai Branch Institute of Traditional Medicine, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei School of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Departments of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsai', 'firstname': 'Yueh-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lo', 'firstname': 'Pei-Chia', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Jung-Nien', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/MD.0000000000004917,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dda86c20>,,,,,,

25854867",Progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment in a diverse clinic-based and community-based elderly cohort.,"Investigation of the conversion rates from normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is important, as effective early intervention could potentially prevent or substantially delay the onset of dementia. However, reported conversion rates differ across studies and recruitment source. Our study examined predictors of conversion from NC to MCI in a racially and ethnically diverse sample drawn both from community and clinic recruitment sources.
Rates and predictors of conversion were assessed in an ongoing prospective longitudinal study at University of California, Davis, Alzheimer's Disease Center from 2000 to 2015. Participants (n = 254) were recruited through a clinic (5%) and community sample (95%). They were clinically confirmed as cognitively normal at baseline and followed up to seven years. Recruitment source, demographic factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, year of education, APOE ε4 positive), cognitive measures (SENAS test scores), functional assessments (CDR sum of boxes), and neuroimaging measures (total brain volume, total hippocampal volume, white hyperintensity volume) were assessed as predictors of conversion from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment using proportional hazards models.
Of 254 participants, 62 (11 clinic, 51 community) progressed to MCI. The clinic-based sample showed an annual conversion rate of 30% (95% CI 17%-54%) per person-year, whereas the community-based sample showed a conversion rate of 5% (95% CI 3%-6%) per person-year. Risk factors for conversion include clinic-based recruitment, being older, lower executive function and worse functional assessment at baseline, and smaller total brain volume.
Older adults who sought out a clinical evaluation, even when they are found to have normal cognition, have increased risk of subsequent development of MCI. Results are consistent with other studies showing subjective cognitive complaints are a risk for future cognitive impairment, but extend such findings to show that those who seek evaluation for their complaints are at particularly high risk. Moreover, these individuals have subtle, but significant differences in functional and cognitive abilities that, in the presence of concerns and evidence of atrophy on by brain imaging, warrant continued clinical follow-up.

164,27421787,Differential Linguistic Recall Effects in the California Verbal Learning Test in Healthy Aging and Alzheimer's Dementia: Analysis of Routine Diagnostic Data.,"Psycholinguistic evidence suggests that certain word characteristics might influence recall rates in word-list learning tests. These effects were investigated in the German California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-G) in a clinical setting.
Subjects were memory clinic patients without cognitive diagnosis (N = 45) and with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) (N = 48) matched for age, sex, depressive symptoms, and education. The CVLT-G's words were analyzed with regard to length, frequency, and neighborhood size and dichotomized into low and high value groups. For each linguistic variable, a 2 (diagnosis: control vs. DAT) × 3 (time: Trial 1 vs. Trial 5 vs. Long Delay Free Recall) × 2 (linguistic: low vs. high) repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was conducted.
RM-ANOVAs revealed a main effect for frequency, F(1,91) = 21.03, p < 0.001, and interactions between time and frequency, F(1.97,179.09) = 5.18, p = 0.007, and diagnosis and neighborhood, F(1.77,161.23) = 13.60, p < 0.001. High-frequency words were better recalled at Trial 5 (Cohen's d = 0.37) and long delayed free recall (d = 0.16) and learning from Trials 1 to 5 was better for high-frequency words (d = 0.39). Controls recalled large neighborhood words better whereas the opposite was true for persons with DAT (d = 0.76).
Frequency and neighborhood size seem to influence learning and retention in the CVLT-G with neighborhood size producing opposed effects for persons with and without DAT. These results are in line with international experimental studies and likely not specific to the German language. Potential diagnostic implications and possibilities for test construction and interpretation are discussed.","['CVLT', 'Neighborhood Size', 'Verbal Memory', 'Word Frequency', 'Word Length']",Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,2016-07-17,"[{'lastname': 'Hessler', 'firstname': 'Johannes Baltasar', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fischer', 'firstname': 'Alina Maria', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jahn', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]","Subjects were memory clinic patients without cognitive diagnosis (N = 45) and with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) (N = 48) matched for age, sex, depressive symptoms, and education.

165,27380760,Socioeconomic Disparities and Mortality After a Diagnosis of Dementia: Results From a Nationwide Registry Linkage Study.,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to a higher incidence of dementia. Less is known about the association between SES and mortality in persons with dementia. We studied this association in a prospective cohort of 15,558 patients in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2010. SES was measured using disposable household income and divided in tertiles. Overall, there was a negative relationship between SES and mortality in both sexes and both settings of care. For men who visited a day clinic, the 5-year mortality rate was 74% among those in the lowest tertile of SES and 57% among those in the highest; for women, the rates were 60% and 50%, respectively. The differences in median survival times between persons in the lower and upper tertiles of SES were 260 days for men and 300 days for women. For men who were admitted to the hospital, the 5-year mortality rate was 89% among those in the lowest tertile of SES and 86% among those in the highest; for women, the rates were 83% and 77%, respectively. The differences in median survival times between persons in the lower and upper tertiles of SES were 80 days for men and 130 days for women. Among patients who visited a day clinic, for patients in the lowest tertile of SES versus those in the highest, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.26, 1.57); for those admitted to the hospital, it was 1.14 (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.20). In summary, lower SES was associated with a higher mortality risk in both men and women with dementia. The results of the present study should raise awareness in clinicians and caregivers about the unfavorable prognosis in the most deprived patients.","['cohort', 'dementia', 'income', 'mortality', 'prognosis', 'socioeconomic status']",American journal of epidemiology,2016-07-07,"[{'lastname': 'van de Vorst', 'firstname': 'Irene E', 'initials': 'IE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koek', 'firstname': 'Huiberdina L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Charlotte E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bots', 'firstname': 'Michiel L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vaartjes', 'firstname': 'Ilonca', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"© The Author 2016.

166,26952697,Dementia in Parkinson's disease: Is male gender a risk factor?,"The rates of cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are higher than in the general population. Age and disease duration have been associated with increasing rates of dementia in PD. However, the role of other factors including gender has been poorly investigated. We investigated the relationship between dementia and gender along with other established risk factors, such as age and disease duration.
We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study including all consecutive patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD attending a single out-patient tertiary clinic over an 18-year period (1995-2013). Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria.
Prevalence of dementia was 11.5% (95%CI, 10.8-12.3) and 13.5% (95%CI, 12.7-14.5) in the whole population (N = 6599) and in those aged ≥60 years (N = 5373), respectively. Age and disease duration were independently associated with dementia, and the latter was associated with dementia up to 84 years of age. Male gender was an independent risk factor. In addition, while the rate of dementia increased in males over all age strata, we found that in females prevalence began to increase steadily after the age of 65 years, reaching male estimates only after 80 years of age. Higher rates in male gender were observed between 60 and 80 years of age.
Age and PD duration are confirmed risk factors for dementia. However, disease duration appeared to be a less important factor in cognitive decline in patients aged ≥85 years. As opposed to gender-specific estimates in the general population, male gender is likely associated with higher rates of dementia in PD patients.","['Dementia', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', ""Parkinson's disease"", 'Prevalence']",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2016-03-10,"[{'lastname': 'Cereda', 'firstname': 'Emanuele', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition and Dietetics Service, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.

167,26935787,Characteristics of Pediatric Exposures to Antidementia Drugs Reported to a Poison Control System.,"To characterize pediatric exposures to the antidementia drugs donepezil, memantine, rivastigmine, and galantamine by reviewing a poison control system's database.
A retrospective review of a statewide poison control system's database identified cases of pediatric (less than 19 years of age) exposures to antidementia drugs over an 11-year period. Data collected included age, sex, drug(s) involved, route of exposure, reason for exposure, symptoms, and interventions.
There were 189 cases identified (53% male, median age: 2.3 years, 99% unintentional exposures). Donepezil was the most commonly reported exposure (106 cases), followed by memantine (57), galantamine (18), oral rivastigmine (16), and transdermal rivastigmine (3). Coingestants were reported in 68 (36%) cases. Symptoms were reported in 38 (20%) cases. Gastrointestinal symptoms were most common (n = 21) followed by central nervous system depression (n = 15). Oral rivastigmine was associated with higher rates of symptoms. No bradycardia, seizures, or fasciculations were reported. Eighty-nine cases (47%) were evaluated at a health care facility, and 13 (7%) were admitted to a hospital. Oral rivastigmine exposures were associated with increased rate of health care facility evaluation. Activated charcoal was administered in 28 cases. Atropine was given only once, for drooling. There were no serious outcomes or deaths in this series.

24567611",Health characteristics and consultation patterns of people with intellectual disability: a cross-sectional database study in English general practice.,"People with intellectual disability (ID) are a group with high levels of healthcare needs; however, comprehensive information on these needs and service use is very limited.
To describe chronic disease, comorbidity, disability, and general practice use among people with ID compared with the general population.
This study is a cross-sectional analysis of a primary care database including 408 English general practices in 2012.
A total of 14 751 adults with ID, aged 18-84 years, were compared with 86 221 age-, sex- and practice-matched controls. Depending on the outcome, prevalence (PR), risk (RR), or odds (OR) ratios comparing patients with ID with matched controls are shown.
Patients with ID had a markedly higher prevalence of recorded epilepsy (18.5%, PR 25.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.29 to 27.57), severe mental illness (8.6%, PR 9.10, 95% CI = 8.34 to 9.92), and dementia (1.1%, PR 7.52, 95% CI = 5.95 to 9.49), as well as moderately increased rates of hypothyroidism and heart failure (PR>2.0). However, recorded prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and cancer was approximately 30% lower than the general population. The average annual number of primary care consultations was 6.29 for patients with ID, compared with 3.89 for matched controls. Patients with ID were less likely to have longer doctor consultations (OR 0.73, 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.77), and had lower continuity of care with the same doctor (OR 0.77, 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.82).
Compared with the general population, people with ID have generally higher overall levels of chronic disease and greater primary care use. Ensuring access to high-quality chronic disease management, especially for epilepsy and mental illness, will help address these greater healthcare needs. Continuity of care and longer appointment times are important potential improvements in primary care.","['chronic disease', 'continuity of care', 'intellectual disability', 'learning disabilities', 'primary care']",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,2016-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Carey', 'firstname': 'Iain M', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': ""Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, London.""}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Sunil M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': ""Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, London.""}, {'lastname': 'Hosking', 'firstname': 'Fay J', 'initials': 'FJ', 'affiliation': ""Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, London.""}, {'lastname': 'DeWilde', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, London.""}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Tess', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, London.""}, {'lastname': 'Beighton', 'firstname': 'Carole', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Heath Social Care and Education, Kingston and St George's, University of London, London.""}, {'lastname': 'Cook', 'firstname': 'Derek G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': ""Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, London.""}]","A total of 14 751 adults with ID, aged 18-84 years, were compared with 86 221 age-, sex- and practice-matched controls.

Retrospective cohort study.
Academic medical center.
Individuals aged 18 and older hospitalized from August 2012 to August 2013, excluding those admitted to obstetrics and gynecology or psychiatry or with a psychotic disorder.
Use was ascertained from pharmacy charges. Potentially excessive dosing was defined using guidelines for long-term care facilities. A review of 100 records was performed to determine reasons for use.
The cohort included 17,775 admissions with a median age 64; individuals could have been admitted more than once during the study period. Antipsychotics were used in 9%, 55% of which were initiations. The most common reasons for initiation were delirium (53%) and probable delirium (12%). Potentially excessive dosing occurred in 16% of admissions exposed to an antipsychotic. Of admissions with antipsychotic initiation, 26% were discharged on these medications. Characteristics associated with initiation included age 75 and older (relative risk (RR) = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-1.7), male sex (RR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.4), black race (RR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6-0.96), delirium (RR = 4.8, 95% CI = 4.2-5.7), dementia (RR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.7-2.6), admission to a medical service (RR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.4), intensive care unit stay (RR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.8-2.4), and mechanical ventilation (RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.7-2.4). In individuals who were initiated on an antipsychotic, characteristics associated with discharge on antipsychotics were age 75 and older (RR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-0.7), discharge to any location other than home (RR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.8-3.3), and class of in-hospital antipsychotic exposure (RR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.3 for atypical vs typical; RR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.9-3.8 for both vs typical).

170,26787126,Dementia: A risk factor for burns in the elderly.,"Older people are disproportionately at risk of burn and have a high risk of dementia; however the impact of dementia on risk of burn is unknown.
Linked hospitalisation and death records for individuals aged 65 years and older admitted to a NSW hospital for a burn over the ten year period 2003-2012 were analysed. Demographic and burn characteristics and health outcomes were compared for people with and without dementia. Incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 population and negative binomial regression was used to examine temporal trends.
Of the 1535 older people hospitalised for a burn, 11.0% had a record of dementia. The age-standardised incidence rate for people with dementia was 22.7 per 100,000, and for people without dementia was 14.2 per 100,000 population, an incident rate ratio (IRR) of 1.6 (95%CI 1.3-2.0, p<0.0001). There was no significant change in rates over time. People with dementia were more likely to be admitted with burns to the trunk and have greater than 20% total body surface area (TBSA) burn. Mean length of stay (LOS) was more than double (24 vs 12 days) and 30-day mortality three times higher (15.4% vs 5.1%) for people with dementia. Adjusting for differences in age, sex, TBSA, inhalation injury, comorbidities and complications eliminated the increased mortality but not the difference in LOS. People with dementia were more likely to have been burnt by hot tap water (RR 2.3; 95%CI 1.8-2.8, p<0.0001) and ignition of clothing/nightwear (RR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.4, p=0.0149) and to have sustained the burn in residential aged care (20.0%).
Burns in people with dementia are significant injuries, which have not decreased over the past ten years despite prevention efforts to reduce burns in older people. Targeted prevention education in the home and residential aged care facilities is warranted.","['Burns', 'Burns prevention', 'Death', 'Dementia', 'Elderly', 'Hospitalisations']",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,2016-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Harvey', 'firstname': 'Lara', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Falls and Injury Prevention Group, Neuroscience Research Australia, UNSW, Barker Street, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.

24681664",Heterogeneity of Regional Brain Atrophy Patterns Associated with Distinct Progression Rates in Alzheimer's Disease.,"We aimed to identify and characterize subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibiting different patterns of regional brain atrophy on MRI using age- and gender-specific norms of regional brain volumes. AD subjects included in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study were classified into subtypes based on standardized values (Z-scores) of hippocampal and regional cortical volumes on MRI with reference to age- and gender-specific norms obtained from 222 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Baseline and longitudinal changes of clinical characteristics over 2 years were compared across subtypes. Whole-brain-level gray matter (GM) atrophy pattern using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of the subtypes were also investigated. Of 163 AD subjects, 58.9% were classified as the ""both impaired"" subtype with the typical hippocampal and cortical atrophy pattern, whereas 41.1% were classified as the subtypes with atypical atrophy patterns: ""hippocampal atrophy only"" (19.0%), ""cortical atrophy only"" (11.7%), and ""both spared"" (10.4%). Voxel-based morphometric analysis demonstrated whole-brain-level differences in overall GM atrophy across the subtypes. These subtypes showed different progression rates over 2 years; and all subtypes had significantly lower CSF amyloid-β 1-42 levels compared to CN. In conclusion, we identified four AD subtypes exhibiting heterogeneous atrophy patterns on MRI with different progression rates after controlling the effects of aging and gender on atrophy with normative information. CSF biomarker analysis suggests the presence of Aβ neuropathology irrespective of subtypes. Such heterogeneity of MRI-based neuronal injury biomarker and related heterogeneous progression patterns should be considered in clinical trials and practice with AD patients.",[],PloS one,2015-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Byun', 'firstname': 'Min Soo', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Song E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Jinsick', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'Dahyun', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choe', 'firstname': 'Young Min', 'initials': 'YM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Ulsan University Hospital, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Sohn', 'firstname': 'Bo Kyung', 'initials': 'BK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul Metropolitan Government-Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Hyo Jung', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Baek', 'firstname': 'Hyewon', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Ji Young', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Woo', 'firstname': 'Jong Inn', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Research Institute, Medical Research Center Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Dong Young', 'initials': 'DY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0142756

172,26524236,"The Association in Elderly Hospitalized Patients, Between Psychotropic Drugs and Hip Fractures Resulting from Falls.","Psychotropic drug treatment has been associated with increased risk for falls and hip fractures in elderly patients. The authors examined the association between drug treatment and hip fractures resulting from falls in elderly hospitalized patients, focusing on the medications' anticholinergic properties.
This retrospective case-control study was conducted in an acute geriatric ward in a general medical center. Medical records, including demographic, clinical, biochemical, and pharmacological variables, of elderly patients with hip fractures from falls (N = 185), admitted during a 2-year period, were reviewed and compared with a control group (N = 187) of patients matched for age and gender and without hip fractures.
The usage rates of antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and various nonpsychiatric medications were similar in the two groups, except for hypnotics-anxiolytics (higher rates in hip-fracture patients). The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) and diastolic blood pressure constituted very modest predictors of falls (R(2) = .038, p = .004). There were no significant differences in the anticholinergic burden values, clinical dementia ratings, and comorbidity burden between the two groups.
The rate of psychotropic drug use in general and their anticholinergic burden are similar in acutely admitted elderly patients with or without hip fractures. However, higher usage rate of anxiolytics found in the patients with hip fractures may indicate that this is a risk factor for hip fractures related to falls in elderly patients living in the community.",[],Experimental aging research,2015-11-03,"[{'lastname': 'Aizenberg', 'firstname': 'Dov', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'a Psychogeriatric Department , Geha Mental Health Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.\nb Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Weizman', 'firstname': 'Abraham', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.\nc Research Unit , Geha Mental Health Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.\nd The Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Weiss', 'firstname': 'Avraham', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.\ne Department of Geriatrics , Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Akopian', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.\ne Department of Geriatrics , Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Amitai', 'firstname': 'Maya', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'a Psychogeriatric Department , Geha Mental Health Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.\nb Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Beloosesky', 'firstname': 'Yichayaou', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.\ne Department of Geriatrics , Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.'}]",,"The rate of psychotropic drug use in general and their anticholinergic burden are similar in acutely admitted elderly patients with or without hip fractures.

11522808",Effects of education and race on cognitive decline: An integrative study of generalizability versus study-specific results.,"The objective of the study was to examine variability across multiple prospective cohort studies in level and rate of cognitive decline by race/ethnicity and years of education. We compare data across studies, we harmonized estimates of common latent factors representing overall or general cognitive performance, memory, and executive function derived from the: (a) Washington Heights, Hamilton Heights, Inwood Columbia Aging Project (N = 4,115), (b) Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (N = 525), (c) Duke Memory, Health, and Aging study (N = 578), and (d) Neurocognitive Outcomes of Depression in the Elderly (N = 585). We modeled cognitive change over age for cognitive outcomes by race, education, and study. We adjusted models for sex, dementia status, and study-specific characteristics. The results found that for baseline levels of overall cognitive performance, memory, and executive function, differences in race and education tended to be larger than between-study differences and consistent across studies. This pattern did not hold for rate of cognitive decline: effects of education and race/ethnicity on cognitive change were not consistently observed across studies, and when present were small, with racial/ethnic minorities and those with lower education declining at faster rates. In this diverse set of datasets, non-Hispanic Whites and those with higher education had substantially higher baseline cognitive test scores.

174,26476703,Pharmacotherapy of dementia in Germany: Results from a nationwide claims database.,"In 2011, about 1.1-1.4 million patients with dementia were living in Germany, a number expected to rise to three million by 2050. Dementia poses a major challenge to the healthcare system and neuropharmacological service provision. The aim of this study was to determine prescription rates for anti-dementia drugs as well as for neuroleptics, sedative-hypnotics and antidepressants in dementia using the complete nationwide outpatient claims data pertaining to the services of statutory health insurance. We controlled for gender, age, dementia diagnosis, physician specialty (general practitioner GP versus neuropsychiatry specialist physician NPSP), and rural and urban living area. In about one million prevalent dementia patients (N=1,014,710) in 2011, the prescription prevalence rate of anti-dementia drugs was 24.6%; it varied with gender, age, and diagnosis (highest in Alzheimer's disease; 42%), and was higher in patients treated by NPSPs (48% vs. 25% in GPs). At the same time, we found an alarmingly high rate of treatment with neuroleptics in dementia patients (35%), with an only slightly decreased risk in patients treated exclusively by NPSPs (OR=0.86). We found marginal differences between rural and urban areas. Our results show that the majority of anti-dementia drug prescriptions appear guideline-oriented, yet prescription rates are overall comparatively low. On the other hand, neuroleptic drugs, which are associated with excess morbidity and mortality in dementia, were prescribed very frequently, suggesting excess use given current guidelines. We therefore suggest that guideline implementation measures and increasing quality control procedures are needed with respect to the pharmacotherapy of this vulnerable population.","['Alzheimer׳s disease', 'Antidementia drugs', 'Dementia', 'Drug prescription', 'Germany', 'Prevalence', 'Psychotropics']",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2015-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Bohlken', 'firstname': 'Jens', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Praxis Bohlken, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulz', 'firstname': 'Mandy', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi), Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rapp', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Potsdam, Am Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.

This study aims to compare the characteristics of poisoning resulting in hospitalization in older people with and without dementia and their clinical outcomes.
A retrospective cohort study involving an examination of poisoning by intent involving individuals aged 50+ years with and without dementia using linked hospitalization and mortality records during 2003-2012. Individuals who had dementia were identified from hospital diagnoses and unintentional and intentional poisoning was identified using external cause classifications. The epidemiological profile (i.e. individual and incident characteristics) of poisoning by intent and dementia status was compared, along with clinical outcomes of hospital length of stay (LOS), 28-day readmission and 30-day mortality.
The hospitalization rate for unintentional and intentional poisoning for individuals with dementia was double and 1.5 times higher than the rates for individuals without dementia (69.5 and 31.6 per 100,000) and (56.4 and 32.5 per 100,000).

176,26011093,Caregiving for patients with Alzheimer's disease or dementia and its association with psychiatric and clinical comorbidities and other health outcomes in Brazil.,"Individuals with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease often receive care from family members who experience associated burden. This study provides the first broad, population-based account of caregiving-related health outcome burden in Brazil.
Data were analyzed from the 2012 National Health and Wellness Survey in Brazil (n = 12,000), an Internet-based survey of adults (aged 18+ years), using stratified sampling by sex and age to ensure demographic representation of Brazil's adult population. Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or dementia were compared with non-caregivers on comorbidities, productivity impairment, health-related quality of life, resource utilization, sociodemographic/health characteristics and behaviors, and Charlson comorbidity index scores. Regression models assessed outcomes associated with caregiving, adjusting for potential confounds.
Among 10,853 respondents, caregivers' (n = 209) average age was 42.1 years, 53% were female, and 52% were married/living with a partner. Caregivers versus non-caregivers (n = 10,644) were more frequently obese, smokers, insured, employed, college-educated, and wealthier and had higher Charlson comorbidity index, all p < 0.05. Adjusting for covariates, caregiving was associated with significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 2.008), major depressive disorder (OR = 1.483), anxiety (OR = 1.714), insomnia (OR = 1.644), hypertension (OR = 1.584), pain (OR = 1.704), and diabetes (OR = 2.103), all p < 0.015. Caregiving was also associated with lower health utilities (-0.024 points) and mental health status (-1.70 points), higher rates of presenteeism-related impairment (32.7% greater) and overall work impairment (35.9% greater), and higher traditional provider visit rates (28.7% greater), all p < 0.035.

Within the framework of demographic change the incidence as well as the direct and indirect consequences of injuries will rise. The analysis of an optimal treatment should include functional parameters as well as global health parameters, e.g. quality of life.
The aim of this study was the evaluation of functional outcome, institutionalization (necessity of placement in a residential care home for the elderly, even if temporary), the influence of cognitive deficits, quality of life and the pattern of complications after primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty.
The study included a total of 34 patients (mean age 79.8 ± 6.7 years, 29 female) after implantation of a reversed modular fracture arthroplasty. The mean follow-up was 23 ± 10.6 months). The functional Constant-Murley score (CS), radiology results as well as the extent of institutionalization and quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire were collated.
The clinical examination showed good results in the CS (54 points, SD ± 9). In comparison to the age and gender-related CS according to Gerber the patient scores amounted to 78.9 %. The comparison of patients with and without cognitive deficits did not show any differences (53 vs. 54 points, p = 0.6525). The rate of institutionalization after treatment of humeral head fractures by reversed fracture arthroplasty was 2.94 %. The quality of life measured with EQ-5D showed a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of 0.801. The rate of complications was 2.94 % involving an incomplete lesion of the radial nerve which was in regression.
The results of this study showed good to moderate functional results, very low rates of complications and institutionalization and very good results according to the HRQoL. In comparison to conservative treatment or plate osteosynthesis, better results were achieved in this study with respect to HRQoL.","['Dementia', 'Geriatric trauma', 'Institutionalization', 'Quality of life', 'Reverse shoulder arthroplasty']",Der Unfallchirurg,2015-05-20,"[{'lastname': 'Merschin', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Unfall-, Schulter- und Wiederherstellungschirurgie, Sportmedizin und Sporttraumatologie, Krankenhaus Rummelsberg, ein Haus der Sana Kliniken AG, Rummelsberg 71, 90592, Schwarzenbruck, Deutschland. david.merschin@gmx.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Stangl', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Unfall-, Schulter- und Wiederherstellungschirurgie, Sportmedizin und Sporttraumatologie, Krankenhaus Rummelsberg, ein Haus der Sana Kliniken AG, Rummelsberg 71, 90592, Schwarzenbruck, Deutschland.'}]",,"The results of this study showed good to moderate functional results, very low rates of complications and institutionalization and very good results according to the HRQoL.

The Florida Department of Health received funding from the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to implement a state-wide ALS Surveillance Project. The objectives of the project were to describe the demographic characteristics of ALS cases and to calculate the incidence and prevalence of ALS in Florida.
All neurologists were asked to submit case reports for persons with ALS diagnosed and/or under their care during 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2011. A medical record verification form and an electromyogram (EMG) report were requested for a sample of cases and reviewed by an independent consulting neurologist to confirm ALS diagnosis. Death data were used to aid with case report collection.
Demographics, relevant history and clinical characteristics, El Escorial classifications, time from symptom onset to diagnosis, crude annual incidence rates and 2009 period prevalence are presented.
The 1450 reported ALS cases were more likely to be older, male, white and non-Hispanic. Slightly more than 4% of cases were reported as also having dementia, and 4.8% were reported to have an immediate family member diagnosed with ALS. Incidence rates ranged from 1.7 to 1.9 per 100,000 person-years during the project period and the 2009 period prevalence was 4.0 per 100,000 persons.
Project findings are generally consistent with findings of population-based studies in Europe, as well as geographically limited studies in the USA. Our findings add to the growing body of epidemiological literature about ALS in the USA. Future epidemiological studies in the USA should focus on identifying cases from minority groups and those that may have limited access to healthcare, and should consider conducting capture-recapture analysis to assess case ascertainment.","['EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'PUBLIC HEALTH']",BMJ open,2015-04-23,"[{'lastname': 'Freer', 'firstname': 'Cecilia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hylton', 'firstname': 'Tara', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Florida Department of Health, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jordan', 'firstname': 'Heather M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'McKing Consulting Corporation, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaye', 'firstname': 'Wendy E', 'initials': 'WE', 'affiliation': 'McKing Consulting Corporation, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Sabrina', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Florida Department of Health, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Youjie', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Florida Department of Health, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.'}]",,,"The 1450 reported ALS cases were more likely to be older, male, white and non-Hispanic.

To characterise TB patients requiring acute hospital care and identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality.
Using a Japanese national database of acute-care hospitals, we identified patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB who were discharged (both deceased and alive) between July 2010 and March 2013. Demographic characteristics, comorbidity, procedures and treatments were examined. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality.
Of 877 treated patients (566 males, mean age 74.5 years) identified, 152 (17.3%) died. A standard four-drug regimen of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide was given to 279 (31.8%) patients, and INH, RMP and EMB to 335 (38.2%) patients. Multivariable analysis showed that the three-drug regimen was significantly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.87, 95%CI 1.07-3.27, P = 0.028).

We tested the following null hypotheses: (1) there are no differences between the NHDS and NIS in patient characteristics, comorbidities, and adverse events in patients with hip osteoarthritis treated with THA, and (2) there are no differences between databases in factors associated with inpatient mortality, adverse events, and length of hospital stay after THA.
The NHDS and NIS databases use different methods of data collection and weighting to provide data representative of all nonfederal hospital discharges in the United States. In 2006 the NHDS database contained 203,149 patients with hip arthritis treated with hip arthroplasty, and the NIS database included 193,879 patients. Multivariable analyses for factors associated with inpatient mortality, adverse events, and days of care were constructed for each database.
We found that 26 of 42 of the factors in demographics, comorbidities, and adverse events after THA in the NIS and NHDS databases differed more than 10%. Age and days of care were associated with inpatient mortality with the NHDS and the NIS although the effect rates differ more than 10%. The NIS identified seven other factors not identified by the NHDS: wound complications, congestive heart failure, new mental disorder, chronic pulmonary disease, dementia, geographic region Northeast, acute postoperative anemia, and sex, that were associated with inpatient mortality even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. For inpatient adverse events, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and female sex were associated with the NHDS and the NIS although the effect rates differ more than 10%. There were different directions for sources of payment, dementia, congestive heart failure, and geographic region. For longer length of stay, common factors differing more than 10% in effect rate included chronic pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, complication not elsewhere classified, congestive heart failure, transfusion, discharge nonroutine compared with routine, acute postoperative anemia, hypertension, wound adverse events, and diabetes mellitus, whereas discrepant factors included geographic region, payment method, dementia, sex, and iatrogenic hypotension.
Studies that use large databases intended to be representative of the entire United States population can produce different results, likely related to differences in the databases, such as the number of comorbidities and procedures that can be entered in the database. In other words, analyses of large databases can have limited reliability and should be interpreted with caution.

182,25048626,Psychosocial interventions in Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment: evidence for gender bias in clinical trials.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects twice as many women as men. Gender differences in symptom profile, living conditions, coping style and response might affect the outcome of psychosocial interventions (PSIs).
Our aim was to review gender differences in the available high-quality phase III trials on PSI in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) by considering the gender ratio in the investigated samples.
Randomized controlled trials published in 2000-2012 were stepwise analyzed by statistically testing the representativeness of the gender ratio and examining reported gender differences.
Forty-five studies (62% of 73 studies) reported gender ratios for each subsample and were included. In these studies, females were underrepresented in the control groups. In the 14 studies (19%) reporting analyses of gender differences, women were underrepresented in both intervention and control groups. However, in the six studies (8%) reporting significant gender differences in outcome, gender distribution was in accordance with prevalence rates.
Current evidence is insufficient for reliable conclusions on gender differences in PSI outcome in AD and aMCI, as 81% of the available clinical trials either not reported the gender ratio of their samples, or underrepresent females. Further research is needed addressing gender differences, and clinical trials should routinely control for gender bias.","['Alzheimer`s disease', 'dementia', 'gender differences', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'psychosocial interventions']",Aging & mental health,2014-07-23,"[{'lastname': 'Baron', 'firstname': 'Stefanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Psychology , Humboldt University Berlin , Berlin , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ulstein', 'firstname': 'Ingun', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Werheid', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Current evidence is insufficient for reliable conclusions on gender differences in PSI outcome in AD and aMCI, as 81% of the available clinical trials either not reported the gender ratio of their samples, or underrepresent females.

20519575",Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba?,"Francophones may experience poorer health due to social status, cultural differences in lifestyle and attitudes, and language barriers to health care. Our study sought to compare mental health indicators between Francophones and non-Francophones living in the province of Manitoba.
Two populations were used: one from administrative datasets housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy and the other from representative survey samples. The administrative datasets contained data from physician billings, hospitalizations, prescription drug use, education, and social services use, and surveys included indicators on language variables and on self-rated health.
Outside urban areas, Francophones had lower rates of diagnosed substance use disorder (rate ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and of suicide and suicide attempts (RR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79), compared with non-Francophones, but no differences were found between the groups across the province in rates of diagnosed mood disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, or any mental disorders after adjusting for age, sex, and geographic area. When surveyed, Francophones were less likely than non-Francophones to report that their mental health was excellent, very good, or good (66.9%, compared with 74.2%).
The discrepancy in how Francophones view their mental health and their rates of diagnosed mental disorders may be related to health seeking behaviours in the Francophone population. Community and government agencies should try to improve the mental health of this population through mental health promotion and by addressing language and cultural barriers to health services.
Les francophones peuvent avoir une moins bonne santé en raison du statut social, des différences culturelles de style de vie et de mentalité, et des obstacles linguistiques aux soins de santé. Notre étude cherchait à comparer les indicateurs de santé mentale entre francophones et non-francophones habitant dans la province du Manitoba.
Deux populations ont été utilisées : l’une tirée des bases de données administratives du Centre des politiques de santé du Manitoba et l’autre, issue d’échantillons d’enquête représentatifs. Les bases de données administratives contenaient des données de facturation des médecins, d’hospitalisations, d’utilisation de médicaments sur ordonnance, d’éducation, et d’utilisation des services sociaux, alors que les enquêtes incluaient des indicateurs des variables linguistiques et de la santé autoévaluée.
Hors des régions urbaines, les francophones avaient des taux plus faibles de trouble lié à une substance diagnostiqué (rapport de taux [RT] = 0,80; IC à 95 % 0,68 à 0,95) et de suicide ou de tentatives de suicide (RT = 0,59; IC à 95 % 0,43 à 0,79), comparativement aux non-francophones, mais aucune différence n’a été observée entre les groupes à l’échelle de la province en ce qui concerne les taux de troubles de l’humeur, de troubles anxieux, et de démence diagnostiqués, ou de tout trouble mental après correction pour l’âge, le sexe, et la région géographique. Lorsqu’interrogés, les francophones étaient moins susceptibles que les non-francophones de déclarer que leur santé mentale était excellente, très bonne, ou bonne (66,9 %, comparé à 74,2 %).
L’écart entre la façon dont les francophones voient leur santé mentale et leurs taux de troubles mentaux diagnostiqués peut être lié aux comportements favorisant la santé dans la population francophone. Les organismes communautaires et gouvernementaux devraient tenter d’améliorer la santé mentale de cette population en faisant la promotion de la santé mentale et en réduisant les obstacles linguistiques et culturels aux services de santé.",[],Canadian journal of psychiatry.

10476003","Associations between sleep duration, sleep quality, and cognitive test performance among older adults from six middle income countries: results from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE).","Alterations in sleep architecture are common among older adults. Previous studies have documented associations between sleep duration, sleep quality, and cognitive performance in older individuals, yet few studies have examined these trends using population-based samples from non-Western societies. The present cross-sectional study uses nationally representative datasets from six countries to test several hypotheses related to sleep patterns and cognitive function.
Data were drawn from the first wave of the World Health Organization's study on global ageing and adult health (SAGE), a longitudinal study using samples of older adults (≥ 50 years old) in 6 middle-income countries (China, Ghana, India, Russian Federation, South Africa, and Mexico). Self-report data provided information on sleep quality and sleep duration over the previous 2 nights, and 5 cognitive tests (immediate and delayed verbal recall, forward and backward digit span, and verbal fluency) were used to create a composite z-score of cognitive performance.
Individuals with intermediate sleep durations (> 6-9 h/night) exhibited significantly higher cognitive scores than individuals with short sleep (0-6 h/night; p < 0.001) or long sleep duration (> 9 h/night; p < 0.001). Self-reported sleep quality was positively correlated with cognitive z-score (p < 0.05). Significant sex differences were observed; men generally had higher sleep quality and cognitive scores, while women reported longer sleep durations.
This study documented positive correlations between cognitive scores and sleep quality, and between cognitive z-scores and intermediate sleep duration. These findings are clinically important given the growing rates of dementia and aging populations globally.","['aging', 'cognitive function', 'dementia', 'sleep duration', 'sleep quality']",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,2014-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Gildner', 'firstname': 'Theresa E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR.'}, {'lastname': 'Liebert', 'firstname': 'Melissa A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR.'}, {'lastname': 'Kowal', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland ; University of Newcastle Research Centre on Gender, Health, and Ageing, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chatterji', 'firstname': 'Somnath', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Snodgrass', 'firstname': 'J Josh', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR.'}]",,,"Individuals with intermediate sleep durations (> 6-9 h/night) exhibited significantly higher cognitive scores than individuals with short sleep (0-6 h/night; p < 0.001) or long sleep duration (> 9 h/night; p < 0.001).

18558895",The impact of chronic conditions of care recipients on the labour force participation of informal carers in Australia: which conditions are associated with higher rates of non-participation in the labour force?,"Little is known about the effects of personal and other characteristics of care recipients on the behaviour of carers. The aim of this study is to examine the association between the main chronic (disabling) condition of care recipients and the likelihood of their (matched) primary carers aged 15-64 years being out of the labour force.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2009 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) for people aged 15-64 years. We estimated the rates of exit from the labour force for primary carers and non-carers; rates of chronic disease occurrence for care recipients living with their main carers; odds ratios of primary carers being out of the labour force associated with the main chronic condition of their care recipient who lives with them.
From the 2009 SDAC, we identified 1,268 out of 37,186 eligible participants who were primary carers of a care recipient who lived with them. Of these, 628 (49.5%) were out of the labour force. Most common diseases of care recipients were: back problems (12%); arthritis and related disorders (10%); diseases of the nervous system (such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, cerebral palsy) (7.4%); and conditions originating in the perinatal period or congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities (5.1%). When adjusted for age, sex, education and whether have a long term chronic condition of informal carers, the five conditions of care recipients associated with the highest odds of their carers being out of the labour force were: head injury/acquired brain damage; neoplasms, blood diseases, disorders of the immune system; leg/knee/foot/hip damage from injury/accident; dementia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease; and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (osteoporosis).
This study identifies the type of conditions that have the greatest impact on the labour force participation of informal carers - previously unavailable information for Australia. Australia, like most developed countries, is facing several skills shortages and an ageing population.

7468115",Comparative outcomes of peripheral nerve blocks versus general anesthesia for hip fractures in geriatric Chinese patients.,"Geriatric patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty for hip fractures have unacceptably high rates of postoperative complications and mortality. Whether anesthesia type can affect the outcomes has still been inconclusive.
We compared general anesthesia (GA) and peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) on postoperative complications and mortality in elderly patients with femoral neck fractures (FNF) undergoing hemiarthroplasty.
This retrospective study involved data collection from an electronic database. Two hundred and seventeen patients underwent hemiarthroplasty for FNF between January 2008 and December 2012 at the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Data on mortality within in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year, complications, comorbidities, blood loss and transfusion, operative time, postoperative hospital length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and hospital charge were collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses of all variables were used for 30-day and 1-year mortality.
Seventy-two patients receiving GA and 145 receiving PNBs were eventually submitted and analyzed. Mortality was 6.9%, 14.7%, and 23.5% at in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year, respectively postoperatively, while mortality and cardiovascular complications did not differ between the two anesthetic techniques. Preoperative comorbidities and intraoperative parameters were not statistically different except that patients receiving GA were more likely to have dementia (χ (2)=10.45, P=0.001). The most common complications were acute cardiovascular events, electrolyte disturbances, and delirium. Postoperative acute respiratory events and hypoxemia both were also common, but no differences were found between groups (χ (2)=0.68, P=0.410; χ (2)=3.42, P=0.065, respectively). Key factors negatively influencing mortality included: age, male gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, dementia, perioperative cardiovascular events and respiratory events, postoperative stroke, myocardial infarction, and hypoxia.

188,24819713,Dental caries in Victorian nursing homes.,"The poor oral health of nursing home residents is the cause of substantial morbidity and has major implications relating to health care policy. The aim of this study was to measure dental caries experience in Australians living in nursing homes, and investigate associations with resident characteristics.
Clinical dental examinations were conducted on 243 residents from 19 nursing homes in Melbourne. Resident characteristics were obtained from nursing home records and interviews with residents, family and nursing home staff. Two dental examiners assessed coronal and root dental caries using standard ICDAS-II criteria.
Residents were elderly, medically compromised and functionally impaired. Most required assistance with oral hygiene and professional dental care was rarely utilized. Residents had high rates of coronal and root caries, with a mean 2.8 teeth with untreated coronal caries and 5.0 root surfaces with untreated root caries. Functional impairment and irregular professional dental care were associated with higher rates of untreated tooth decay. There were no significant associations with medical conditions or the number of medications taken.
Nursing home residents have high levels of untreated coronal and root caries, particularly those with high needs due to functional impairment but poor access to professional services.","['Dementia', 'dental caries', 'elderly', 'nursing home', 'root caries']",Australian dental journal,2014-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Silva', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Melbourne Dental School, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Victoria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hopcraft', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morgan', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Residents were elderly, medically compromised and functionally impaired.

189,24506695,Antipsychotic drug prescription rates among Dutch nursing homes: the influence of patient characteristics and the dementia special care unit.,"To assess the differences in antipsychotic drug prescription rates in residents with dementia in dementia special care units (SCUs) of Dutch nursing homes, considering the differences in patient characteristics.
As part of the Waalbed-II study, the data on antipsychotic drug use in 290 patients were collected and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) stage, type of dementia and behaviour (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)) were measured in 14 SCUs in nine nursing homes. A multilevel logistic regression model was used to assess the difference in antipsychotic drug prescription rates between dementia SCUs adjusted for age, gender, GDS stage, type of dementia and CMAI factor scores.
Two hundred and ninety residents met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-two per cent were prescribed an antipsychotic drug. Antipsychotic drugs were more often prescribed in patients with physically aggressive and non-aggressive behaviour and in patients with mixed dementia (vascular/Alzheimer's) than in patients with other types of dementia. Antipsychotic drug prescriptions significantly differed among the dementia SCUs. The odds of antipsychotic drug use for patients in the SCU with the highest prevalence of drug use were 2.76 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-6.69) times as high as for the SCU with the lowest prevalence of drug use, taking the patient characteristics into account.
Antipsychotic drug use in nursing home residents with dementia is not only predicted by the type of dementia and patient behaviour, but it is independently associated with the dementia SCU at which the patient resides. This result indicates that antipsychotic drugs are not only prescribed for their clinical indications (agitation/aggression) but are associated with environmental factors that may reflect a specific nursing home prescribing culture.","['antipsychotics', 'dementia', 'nursing homes']",Aging & mental health,2014-02-11,"[{'lastname': 'van der Putten', 'firstname': 'M J G', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Primary and Community Care, Centre for Family Medicine, Elderly Care Medicine and Public Health , Medical Centre, Radboud University Nijmegen , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wetzels', 'firstname': 'R B', 'initials': 'RB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bor', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zuidema', 'firstname': 'S U', 'initials': 'SU', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koopmans', 'firstname': 'R T C M', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': None}]","As part of the Waalbed-II study, the data on antipsychotic drug use in 290 patients were collected and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) stage, type of dementia and behaviour (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)) were measured in 14 SCUs in nine nursing homes.

21755492",A claims data-based comparison of comorbidity in individuals with and without dementia.,"Multimorbidity is common in advanced age, and is usually associated with negative - yet to some extent preventable - health outcomes. Detecting comorbid conditions is especially difficult in individuals with dementia, as they might not always be able to sufficiently express discomfort. This study compares relevant comorbidity complexes in elderly people with and without dementia, with a particular look at gender- and living environment-specific differences. Moreover, associations between selected comorbid conditions and dementia are reviewed more closely.
Using 2006 claims data from a large German Statutory Health Insurance fund, 9,139 individuals with dementia and 28,614 age- and gender-matched control subjects aged 65 years and older were identified. A total of 30 comorbidity complexes were defined based on ICD-10 codes. Corresponding prevalence rates were calculated, and the association between a distinct condition and dementia was evaluated via logistic regression in the overall sample as well as in analyses stratified by gender and living environment.
Individuals with dementia were more likely to be diagnosed with 15 comorbidity complexes, including Parkinson's, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis (supposed dementia risk factors) or fluids and electrolyte disorders, insomnia, incontinence, pneumonia, fractures and injuries (supposed sequelae). In contrast, they were less likely to be diagnosed with 11 other conditions, which included vision and hearing problems, diseases of the musculoskeletal system, lipoprotein disorders and hypertension. In a gender-stratified analysis, the patterns remained largely the same, but a bigger comorbidity gap between cases and control subjects emerged in the male population. Restricting the analysis to community-living individuals did not lead to any substantial changes.
Besides strengthening the evidence on accepted dementia risk factors and sequelae, the analyses point to particular conditions that are likely to remain untreated or even undiagnosed. This issue seems to affect male and female individuals with dementia to varying degrees. Raising awareness of these conditions is important to possibly preventing comorbidity-associated complications and disease progression in dementia patients. To more comprehensively understand the mutual interactions between dementia and comorbidity, further research on diagnostic and treatment attitudes regarding comorbidity in dementia patients and on their gender-specific health-seeking behaviour seems to be required.",[],BMC geriatrics,2014-01-30,"[{'lastname': 'Bauer', 'firstname': 'Kathrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schwarzkopf', 'firstname': 'Larissa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Health Economics and Health Care Management, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Ingolstaedter Landstrasse 1, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany. l.schwarzkopf@helmholtz-muenchen.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Graessel', 'firstname': 'Elmar', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Holle', 'firstname': 'Rolf', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Besides strengthening the evidence on accepted dementia risk factors and sequelae, the analyses point to particular conditions that are likely to remain untreated or even undiagnosed.

191,24405774,Impulse control disorders in elderly patients.,"There is no epidemiological study on the prevalence of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in the elderly population. The studies on ICDs in elderly patients are limited and some of them are case reports about pathological gambling and kleptomania. The comorbidity of other psychiatric disorders makes diagnosis difficult and has negative effects on both treatment and the prognosis of ICDs. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of ICDs among elderly patients and to evaluate the related sociodemographic and clinical features.
A total of 76 patients aged 60 and over who have been referred to our outpatient clinics in a one-year period were included in the study. A demographic data form was completed. The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) was used to determine axis I psychiatric disorders. The prevalence of ICDs was investigated by using the modified version of the Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview (MIDI). Impulsivity was measured with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test was performed to evaluate the cognitive status of patients and to exclude the diagnosis of dementia. In addition, all patients completed Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90).
The prevalence rate of at least one comorbid ICD in our sample was 17%. When patients with a diagnosis of ICDs not otherwise specified (ICD-NOS) were included, the prevalence rate increased to 22.4%. The most common ICD was intermittent explosive disorder (15.8%), followed by pathological gambling (9.2%). The majority of the sample was men (54%), married (80%), had a high school education (51%), and mid-level socioeconomic status (79%). The only statistically significant difference between the sociodemographic characteristics of patients with or without ICDs was gender. The lifetime prevalence of ICDs was 34.1% in men and 8.6% in women. The prevalence of childhood conduct disorder was significantly higher in the group with ICD. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of suicide attempts, history of physical illness and family history of psychiatric disorders between the groups with or without ICDs. Comorbidity of alcohol/substance abuse was found to be 17.6% in patients with ICD whereas no cases were found in the group without ICD.

We conducted a cross sectional, multicenter study that included six nursing homes. Demographic, clinical characteristics, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), the number and classes of chronic medications, rate of polypharmacy >5 drugs (per day) and polypharmacy >7 drugs (per day) were recorded.
Nine hundred and ninety-three residents were included; 750 (75.5%) fully dependent residents and 243 (24.5%) mobile demented residents requiring institutional care. The mean age was 85.04±7.55 (65-108) years. The mean rates of polypharmacy >5 drugs and polypharmacy >7 drugs were 42.6% and 18.6%, respectively. Differences in polypharmacy >5 drugs and polypharmacy >7 drugs were observed in NHs 24.7%-56% and 4.9%-30.4%, respectively (P<0.001). Mean number of chronic drugs per resident was 5.14±2.60 from 3.81±2.24 to 5.95±2.73 (P<0.001). No differences in polypharmacy were found between sex and fully dependent versus mobile demented residents.

12393082",Sleep apnea and the risk of dementia: a population-based 5-year follow-up study in Taiwan.,"Sleep apnea (SA) has been associated with cognitive impairment. However, no data regarding the risk of dementia in patients with SA has been reported in the general population. This retrospective matched-control cohort study was designed to estimate and compare the risk of dementia in SA and non-SA patients among persons aged 40 and above over a 5-year period follow-up.
We conducted a nationwide 5-year population-based study using data retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005) in Taiwan. The study cohort comprised 1414 patients with SA aged 40 years who had at least 1 inpatient service claim or 1 ambulatory care claim. The comparison cohort comprised 7070 randomly selected patients who were matched with the study group according to sex, age, and index year. We performed Cox proportional-hazards regressions to compute the 5-year dementia-free survival rates after adjusting for potentially confounding factors.
The SA patients in this study had a 1.70-times greater risk of developing dementia within 5 years of diagnosis compared to non-SA age- and sex-matched patients, after adjusting for other risk factors (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-2.31; P < .01). For the gender-dependent effect, only females with SA were more likely to develop dementia (adjust HR: 2.38, 95% CI =1.51-3.74; P < .001). For the age-dependent effect of different genders, males with SA aged 50-59 years had a 6.08 times greater risk for developing dementia (95% CI = 1.96-18.90), and females with SA aged ≥ 70 years had a 3.20 times greater risk of developing dementia (95% CI =1.71-6.00). For the time-dependent effect, dementia may be most likely to occur in the first 2.5 years of follow-up (adjusted HR:2.04, 95% CI =1.35-3.07).

20150730",Does study partner type impact the rate of Alzheimer's disease progression?,"Most patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) do not have a spouse. Despite this, the majority of AD research participants enroll with a spouse study partner. It remains unclear if differences between AD patients who do and do not have a spouse may bias study results. In this study, we examined whether AD patients with different study partner types (spouse versus adult child) demonstrate different rates of disease progression over two years on three outcome measures commonly used in AD research, including clinical trials. We used data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to examine disease progression in participants age 55-90 with probable AD dementia. We examined disease progression as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of the Boxes score, the Mini Mental Status Examination, and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire. Analyses were performed on data for all available eligible participants from the NACC UDS and after performing a propensity-matching model to better account for inherent differences between the populations of interest. Propensity matching was successful only when models did not include age and gender. For both propensity-matched analyses and those of all available data, we did not observe any differences between the study partner populations for any outcome measure. These results suggest that if investigators can improve in recruiting AD patients with adult child caregivers to research, the implications to study results may be minimal.","['Adult children', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'caregivers', 'clinical trial', 'disease progression', 'spouses']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2013-08-30,"[{'lastname': 'Grill', 'firstname': 'Joshua D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': ""Mary S.

11599641",Temporal Discounting Is Associated with an Increased Risk of Mortality among Community-Based Older Persons without Dementia.,"Temporal discounting is an important determinant of many health and financial outcomes, but we are not aware of studies that have examined the association of temporal discounting with mortality.
Participants were 406 older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal cohort study of aging. Temporal discounting was measured using standard preference elicitation questions. Individual discount rates were estimated using a well-established hyperbolic function and used to predict the risk of mortality during up to 5 years of follow-up.
The mean estimate of discounting was 0.45 (SD = 0.33, range: 0.08-0.90), with higher scores indicating a greater propensity to prefer smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed ones. During up to 5 years of follow-up (mean = 3.6 years), 62 (15% of 406) persons died. In a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and education, temporal discounting was associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.103, 95% CI 1.024, 1.190, p = 0.010). Thus, a person with the highest discount rate (score = 0.90) was about twice more likely to die over the study period compared to a person with the lowest discount rate (score = 0.08). Further, the association of discounting with mortality persisted after adjustment for the level of global cognitive function, the burden of vascular risk factors and diseases, and an indicator of psychological well being (i.e., purpose in life).

196,23746948,Treatment of pain in European nursing homes: results from the Services and Health for Elderly in Long TERm Care (SHELTER) study.,"To identify pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management approaches and associated factors in nursing home residents across Europe.
Cross-sectional study with 4156 residents who were assessed using the interRAI instrument for Long Term Care Facilities (interRAI LTCF), including pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management modalities. Those reporting pain were included in the analyses (n = 1900). A deeper analysis was performed for the subsample of residents who reported ""current pain,"" defined as pain at least 1 day within the past 3 days (n = 838), and those who reported ""current pain of moderate to severe intensity"" (n = 590).
Up to 24% of residents who reported pain did not receive any pain medication and up to 11% received it only PRN (as-needed basis), independent of current pain-intensity levels; 61% did not receive any nonpharmacological treatment and 21% received neither pharmacological nor nonpharmacological pain modalities. Considerable differences could be demonstrated across European countries. Factors positively associated with pharmacological pain management were being of female gender, reporting cancer, and having moderate or severe pain. High turnover rates of regular staff and low-to-moderate physicians' availability were negatively associated. Factors positively associated with nonpharmacological treatment were fractures and need of assistance in activities of daily living. Dementia, large nursing home facilities, above-average and high turnover rates of nursing staff, a low physicians' availability, and severe pain intensity were negatively associated.
Despite some advances in recent years, pain treatment in European nursing home residents remains to be suboptimal and requires further improvement.","['European', 'Pain', 'analgesic', 'long term care facilities', 'nursing home residents', 'occupational therapy', 'pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment', 'physical therapy', 'therapy']",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2013-06-12,"[{'lastname': 'Lukas', 'firstname': 'Albert', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Agaplesion Bethesda Clinic, Competence Center of Geriatrics and Aging Research, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

20599669","Changes in frailty-related characteristics of the hip fracture population and their implications for healthcare services: evidence from Quebec, Canada.","This study provides evidence that a number of frailty-related characteristics (older age, de novo admission to long-term care (LTC), comorbidities [Charlson Index, osteoporosis, osteoporosis risk factors, sarcopenia risk factors, and dementia]) have increased in the hip fracture population from 2001-2008. This will have significant impact on community resources, as the number of people discharged to the community is also increasing.
The aim of this study is to estimate secular changes in the prevalence of selected frailty-related characteristics among the hip fracture population in the Canadian province of Quebec (2001-2008) and the potential impact of these changes on healthcare services.
The Quebec hospitalization database was used to identify nontraumatic hip fractures for the purposes of calculating age- and sex-specific rates. Also estimated were time trends for selected frailty-related characteristics and discharge destinations.
A significant decline in fracture rates was evident for all age groups except for those <65; sex differences were also observed. Almost all frailty-related characteristics increased over time, ranging from 2 to 14 % per year, which translates to an estimated increase from 16 to 112 %, over the study period. For those whose prior living arrangement was LTC, rates of hip fractures declined significantly (women OR = 0.93, 0.91-0.95; men OR = 0.97, 0.94-0.99). In-hospital mortality and discharge to inpatient rehabilitation decreased, while discharges back to community and to LTC increased.
Although hip fracture rates decreased for older hip fracture patients, the absolute number and prevalence of specific frailty-related characteristics increased. Policy makers should review care models to ensure that adequate resources are provided to the community to offset the expected increase in demand arising from ongoing changes in patients' characteristics.",[],Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2013-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Auais', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'International Centre for Health Innovation, Ivey Business School, Western University, London, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Morin', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nadeau', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Finch', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mayo', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"A significant decline in fracture rates was evident for all age groups except for those <65; sex differences were also observed.

17462081",Responders versus nonresponders in a dementia study of the oldest old: the 90+ study.,"Because of difficulties in finding, recruiting, and diagnosing dementia in the oldest old (ages ≥90 years), most incidence studies include few very elderly persons, and little is known about the characteristics of those who refuse participation. In a California longitudinal study of dementia and aging (The 90+ Study, 2003-2011), we compared nonresponders with responders with regard to information collected 20 years earlier and the impression of dementia as determined during telephone recruitment. Of 1,815 eligible subjects, 1,514 (83%) joined the study, 182 refused, and 119 could not be contacted. Responders did not differ from nonresponders by sex or previously collected medical history or lifestyle behaviors. Recruiters' impressions of dementia were similar in responders and nonresponders who refused (35% and 38%), and among responders, impressions of dementia showed high positive predictive value (95%) but low sensitivity (51%) for a diagnosis of dementia made during the study. Although epidemiologic studies among the very old have the potential for significant nonresponse bias due to a high proportion of frail, ill, and cognitively impaired persons, strategies can improve response rates to over 80%. Classifying nonresponders on cognitive ability at recruitment, though crude, will give some idea of the selective bias in dementia prevalence and incidence estimates introduced by nonresponse due to cognitive status.","['aged', 'bias', 'cohort studies', 'dementia', 'epidemiologic methods', 'refusal to participate']",American journal of epidemiology,2013-04-10,"[{'lastname': 'Paganini-Hill', 'firstname': 'Annlia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA. annliahi@usc.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Ducey', 'firstname': 'Beverly', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hawk', 'firstname': 'Marian', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1093/aje/kws424,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc0a8900>,,,,,,

15883317",Atrophy rates in asymptomatic amyloidosis: implications for Alzheimer prevention trials.,"There is considerable interest in designing therapeutic studies of individuals at risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) to prevent the onset of symptoms. Cortical β-amyloid plaques, the first stage of AD pathology, can be detected in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET), and several studies have shown that ~1/3 of healthy elderly have significant β-amyloid deposition. Here we assessed whether asymptomatic amyloid-PET-positive controls have increased rates of brain atrophy, which could be harnessed as an outcome measure for AD prevention trials. We assessed 66 control subjects (age = 73.5±7.3 yrs; MMSE = 29±1.3) from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers & Lifestyle study who had a baseline Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET scan and two 3T MRI scans ~18-months apart. We calculated PET standard uptake value ratios (SUVR), and classified individuals as amyloid-positive/negative. Baseline and 18-month MRI scans were registered, and brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes and annualized volume changes calculated. Increasing baseline PiB-PET measures of β-amyloid load correlated with hippocampal atrophy rate independent of age (p = 0.014). Twenty-two (1/3) were PiB-positive (SUVR>1.40), the remaining 44 PiB-negative (SUVR≤1.31). Compared to PiB-negatives, PiB-positive individuals were older (76.8±7.5 vs. 71.7±7.5, p<0.05) and more were APOE4 positive (63.6% vs. 19.2%, p<0.01) but there were no differences in baseline brain, ventricle or hippocampal volumes, either with or without correction for total intracranial volume, once age and gender were accounted for. The PiB-positive group had greater total hippocampal loss (0.06±0.08 vs. 0.02±0.05 ml/yr, p = 0.02), independent of age and gender, with non-significantly higher rates of whole brain (7.1±9.4 vs. 4.7±5.5 ml/yr) and ventricular (2.0±3.0 vs. 1.1±1.0 ml/yr) change. Based on the observed effect size, recruiting 384 (95%CI 195-1080) amyloid-positive subjects/arm will provide 80% power to detect 25% absolute slowing of hippocampal atrophy rate in an 18-month treatment trial.

200,23115781,Predictors of emergency commitment for nursing home residents: the role of resident and facility characteristics.,"The ability of nursing homes to manage the mental health needs of their residents is crucial to providing high quality care. An important element is preventing exacerbations of psychiatric conditions that trigger discharge from the nursing home (NH) because of an emergency commitment (EC) for an involuntary psychiatric examination. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between resident and facility characteristics and the risk of EC for involuntary psychiatric examination among Medicaid-enrolled NH residents in Florida.
This retrospective cohort study employed 2.5 years (31 December 2002 through 30 June 2005) of Medicaid enrollment and fee-for-service, pharmacy, and involuntary commitment data to examine resident characteristics. NH characteristics were obtained from the Online Survey Certification and Reporting database.
Medicaid-certified NHs in Florida (N= 584).
Medicaid-enrolled NH residents (N= 32,604).
Younger age, male gender, having dementia, having a serious mental illness (SMI), and residing in a for-profit facility were all independently associated with the greater risk of EC. Although most residents with EC were prescribed psychotropic medication, less than half received non-pharmacological behavioral health outpatient services before or after their involuntary psychiatric examination.

201,23110866,Mild cognitive impairment in a community sample: the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with an increased dementia risk. This study reports incidence of MCI subtypes, rates of progression to dementia, and stability of MCI classification.
We examined 873 community-dwelling adults aged 70 to 90 years over 2 years as part of an ongoing population-based longitudinal study, the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. Neuropsychological testing assessed five cognitive domains, and a diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, MCI, or dementia (follow-up only) was made according to published criteria.
The incidence of MCI was 104.6 (95% confidence interval: 81.6-127.7) per 1000 person-years, with higher incidence in men (men, 156.8; women, 70.3). Incidence rates for single-domain amnestic, multiple-domain amnestic, single-domain nonamnestic, and multiple-domain nonamnestic MCI were 47.7, 7.9, 45.0, and 3.9 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The 2-year rate of progression from MCI at baseline to dementia was 4.8%, being highest for multidomain amnestic MCI (9.1%). Of those with MCI at baseline, 28.2% reverted to no cognitive impairment at follow-up. Sensitivity analyses by redefining criteria for cognitive impairment did not affect stability of diagnosis, although changing the threshold of domain impairment reduced baseline MCI prevalence from 36.7% to 5.7% and incidence to 23.5, and increased 2-year progression rate from MCI to dementia to 14.3%.
Incidence rates for MCI are higher than previously reported, particularly in men and for single-domain MCI; rates for amnestic and nonamnestic MCI were comparable. Multidomain amnestic MCI was the most likely subtype to progress to dementia, but overall, the diagnosis of MCI, particularly single-domain MCI, shows considerable instability.",[],Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2012-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Brodaty', 'firstname': 'Henry', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Primary Dementia Collaborative Research Centre, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, New South Wales, Australia. h.brodaty@unsw.edu.au'}, {'lastname': 'Heffernan', 'firstname': 'Megan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kochan', 'firstname': 'Nicole A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Draper', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Trollor', 'firstname': 'Julian N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Reppermund', 'firstname': 'Simone', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Slavin', 'firstname': 'Melissa J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sachdev', 'firstname': 'Perminder S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The incidence of MCI was 104.6 (95% confidence interval: 81.6-127.7) per 1000 person-years, with higher incidence in men (men, 156.8; women, 70.3).

202,23041090,Gender-related differences in patients with acute heart failure: management and predictors of in-hospital mortality.,"Gender-related differences in clinical phenotype, in-hospital management and prognosis of acute heart failure (AHF) patients have been previously reported in European and US registries. The ALARM-HF survey is the first to include a cohort of 4953 patients hospitalized for AHF in 666 hospitals in 6 European countries, Mexico and Australia.
Women accounted for 37% of the study population, were older and had higher rates of de novo heart failure (45% vs 36%, p<0.001) than men. An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was the predominant precipitating factor in both genders, but to a lesser extent in females (30% vs 42%, p<0.001). Between genders comparison showed higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, diabetes, obesity, anemia and depression in women (p<0.05). Similarly, women had higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on admission (42 ± 15% vs 36 ± 13%, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (135 ± 40 mm Hg vs 131 ± 39 mm Hg, p=0.001) than men. On the other hand, men had more often coronary artery disease, renal failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p<0.05). Importantly, in-hospital mortality was similar in both genders (11.1% in females vs 10.5% in males, p=0.475), and its common predictors were: systolic blood pressure at admission, creatinine>1.5mg/dL and diabetes. Furthermore, recent ACS, valvular heart disease and dementia contributed to prognosis in women, while LVEF, hypertension and anemia were independent predictors in men.
Among patients with AHF, there are significant differences in co-morbidities, precipitating factors and predictors of in-hospital mortality between genders. Nevertheless, in-hospital mortality remains similar between genders.","['Acute heart failure', 'Co-morbidities', 'Gender', 'Mortality', 'Surveys']",International journal of cardiology,2012-10-09,"[{'lastname': 'Parissis', 'firstname': 'John T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Second Cardiology Department, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece. jparissis@yahoo.com'}, {'lastname': 'Mantziari', 'firstname': 'Lilian', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kaldoglou', 'firstname': 'Nikolaos', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ikonomidis', 'firstname': 'Ignatios', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nikolaou', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mebazaa', 'firstname': 'Alexandre', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Altenberger', 'firstname': 'Johann', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Delgado', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vilas-Boas', 'firstname': 'Fabio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Paraskevaidis', 'firstname': 'Ioannis', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Anastasiou-Nana', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Follath', 'firstname': 'Ferenc', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Among patients with AHF, there are significant differences in co-morbidities, precipitating factors and predictors of in-hospital mortality between genders.

Trend and comparative analyses of the U.S. multiple-cause-of-death records for 1999 to 2008.
United States.
Participants were decedents with Alzheimer's disease (AD) coded as underlying or associated cause of death; decedents with other forms of dementia or cognitive disorder were excluded.
Case frequency, age-specific death rates, and crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were estimated for all AD decedents from the sampled period. Measures of AD mortality burden were compared with those of other leading causes of death (e.g., diabetes mellitus, stroke).
From 1999 to 2008, 879,281 AD-related deaths were identified. The age-adjusted mortality rate for AD increased from 45.3 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval (CI) = 45.0-45.7) in 1999 to 50.0 per 100,000 population (95% CI = 49.7-50.3) in 2008.

A small proportion of PD patients survive and are ambulatory for ≥ 20 years. We sought to identify features associated with long-duration PD (dPD).
This five-center, case-control study compared 136 PD patients with ≥ 20 years of duration and H&Y stage ≤ 4 (dPD) to 134 H&Y-, age- and gender-matched PD patients between 10 and 15 years of disease (cPD).
By study design, there were no between-group differences in age, gender and H&Y. dPD subjects were younger at onset (p < 0.0001), had more psychosis (p: 0.038), were receiving higher levodopa equivalent daily doses (p: 0.02), were predominantly left-handed (p: 0.048), and had greater frequency of left-sided onset (p: 0.015) compared to cPD subjects. Both groups had similar rates of resting tremor, dementia and REM sleep behavior disorder.

205,22261551,Can mild cognitive impairment be accurately diagnosed in english speakers from linguistic minorities? Results from the Sydney Memory and Ageing study.,": The aim of this article was to examine the prevalence and incidence over 2 years of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in English speakers from linguistic minorities.
: Cross-sectional and longitudinal with 2-year follow-up.
: Eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
: Eight hundred twenty-seven community-dwelling participants from English-speaking backgrounds (ESB) and 160 participants from non-English-speaking backgrounds (NESB) recruited through the electoral roll.
: Participants were assessed using 11 neuropsychological tests measuring memory, language, attention/processing speed, and executive function. Questionnaires measuring functional impairment and subjective cognitive complaints were completed by participants or informants.
: We found a two- to threefold higher prevalence of MCI in NESB participants than ESB participants depending on the impairment criterion applied. This difference was because of higher rates of objective cognitive impairment in NESB participants; rates of functional impairment and subjective cognitive complaints did not differ between the groups. This association between MCI prevalence and NESB status was accounted for by the proportion of time the participant spoke English and the proportion of life they had lived in Australia, but not by age, gender, and education. There were no differences between NESB and ESB groups in MCI incidence, dementia incidence, or rates of conversion from MCI to dementia. NESB participants had lower rates of reversion from MCI to normal.
: It is difficult to accurately diagnose MCI in persons from linguistic minority groups, even when proficient in English as neuropsychological test scores may not be valid for these groups.

19091445","Age-specific and sex-specific prevalence and incidence of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer dementia in blacks and whites: a report from the Einstein Aging Study.","As the population ages, the need to characterize rates of cognitive impairment and dementia within demographic groups defined by age, sex, and race becomes increasingly important. There are limited data available on the prevalence and incidence of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI) from population-based studies. The Einstein Aging Study, a systematically recruited community-based cohort of 1944 adults aged 70 or older (1168 dementia free at baseline; mean age, 78.8 y; average follow-up, 3.9 y), provides the opportunity to examine the prevalence and incidence rates for dementia, Alzheimer dementia (AD), aMCI, and naMCI by demographic characteristics. Dementia prevalence was 6.5% (4.9% AD). Overall dementia incidence was 2.9/100 person-years (2.3/100 person-years for AD). Dementia and AD rates increased with age but did not differ by sex. Prevalence of aMCI was 11.6%, and naMCI prevalence was 9.9%. aMCI incidence was 3.8 and naMCI incidence was 3.9/100 person-years. Rates of aMCI increased significantly with age in men and in blacks; sex, education, and race were not significant risk factors. In contrast, naMCI incidence did not increase with age; however, blacks were at higher risk compared with whites, even when controlling for sex and education. Results highlight the public health significance of preclinical cognitive disease.",[],Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,2011-12-14,"[{'lastname': 'Katz', 'firstname': 'Mindy J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Saul B.

 Eight time points across 6.5 years from a subsample of adults aged 70 years and older who were participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) were analyzed using latent growth modeling. Baseline attitudes toward planning for future care and demographic variables functioned as predictors in the conditional analyses. 
 Awareness, Gathering Information, Decision Making, and Concrete Planning increased across time, but Avoidance did not. Covariates were more often associated with the initial levels of planning behavior than with change across time. Women engaged in more initial Decision Making than men. Education was associated with more initial Gathering Information, Decision Making, and less Avoidance. Favorable attitudes toward planning were more predictive of baseline Awareness, Gathering Information, Avoidance, and less so for Decision Making or Concrete Planning.

Most estimates derive from convenience samples from dementia clinics or research centers where there is substantial potential for survival bias and other distortions. In a population-based sample of incident AD cases, we examined progression of impairment in cognition, function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the influence of selected variables on these domains.
Longitudinal, prospective cohort study.
Cache County (Utah).
Three hundred twenty-eight persons with a diagnosis of possible/probable AD.
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-sb), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).
Over a mean follow-up of 3.80 (range: 0.07-12.90) years, the mean (SD) annual rates of change were -1.53 (2.69) scale points on the MMSE, 1.44 (1.82) on the CDR-sb, and 2.55 (5.37) on the NPI. Among surviving participants, 30% to 58% progressed less than 1 point per year on these measures, even 5 to 7 years after dementia onset. Rates of change were correlated between MMSE and CDR-sb (r = -0.62, df = 201, p < 0.001) and between the CDR-sb and NPI (r = 0.20, df = 206, p < 0.004). Female subjects (LR χ = 8.7, df = 2, p = 0.013) and those with younger onset (likelihood ratio [LR] χ = 5.7, df = 2, p = 0.058) declined faster on the MMSE. Although one or more apolipoprotein E ε 4 alleles and ever use of FDA-approved antidementia medications were associated with initial MMSE scores, neither was related to the rate of progression in any domain.

210,21593564,Effect of environmental enrichment on the immunoendocrine aging of male and female triple-transgenic 3xTg-AD mice for Alzheimer's disease.,"We have previously shown that 3xTgAD mice (triple-transgenic mice for Alzheimer's disease, harboring PS1(M146V), AβPP(Swe), tau(P301L) transgenes) suffer detrimental changes in some key lymphocyte functions, described as health and longevity markers, with males being more affected than females and showing higher mortality rates. In the present work, 3xTgAD and wild type 129/C57BL6 male and female non- and environmentally enriched mice were used. The enriched environment (EE) began in the adulthood (6 months) and lasted for 5.5 months. The animals were sacrificed at advanced stages of the disease (15 month-old), and spleen, thymus, and plasma were obtained. The results indicate that 3xTg-AD males are especially benefitted from EE exposure, as shown by the improvement in lymphocyte functional activities such as chemotaxis and natural killer cytotoxicity, as well as in plasma corticosterone levels. By contrast, wild type females seem to be highly sensitive to EE removal, as regards the proliferation capacity of lymphocytes and their intracellular glutathione content. These results support the relevance of gender differences in AD when screening for new strategies for the control of the disease, and suggest that active life, by means of EE, should be maintained until natural death in order to preserve all the positive effects that this strategy exerts on the immune system.",[],Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2011-05-20,"[{'lastname': 'Arranz', 'firstname': 'Lorena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology (Animal Physiology II), Faculty of Biology, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'De Castro', 'firstname': 'Nuria M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Baeza', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Giménez-Llort', 'firstname': 'Lydia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'De la Fuente', 'firstname': 'Mónica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-2011-110236,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc01cf90>,,,,,,

In this community-based, observational, cross-sectional study, participants assisted by the health family program in São Paulo, Brazil, were sampled and interviewed face to face by questionnaire. Participants (n=388) were selected from the collaborative program developed by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group, an International Network of investigators. Demographics, health history and a detailed assessment of UI and urinary symptoms were obtained. Prevalence of UI was calculated. Other variables included age, body mass index (BMI), duration of incontinence and characteristics of the symptoms. The association between UI and the variables was estimated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-squared test and Fisher test (depending on normality of the distribution and expected frequencies). Prevalence of UI was 38.4%. UI was more common in women than in men (50% vs. 18.3%, p<0.001). Diabetes, obesity and hypertension were associated with UI. Almost 36.2% of the cases were of mixed incontinence, 26.8% of urge incontinence and 24.2% of stress incontinence. Men were more likely to have urge-incontinence, while women were more likely to have mixed incontinence (p=0.001).

212,21549645,Prevalence of psychotropic medication use among German and Austrian nursing home residents: a comparison of 3 cohorts.,"Despite increasing knowledge about the limited effectiveness and severe adverse effects, the prescription rate of psychotropic medications in frail elderly persons remains high. Prescriptions are mainly made to control behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, although factors associated with prescriptions are rarely reported. However, such information is a prerequisite to develop intervention programs aiming to safely reduce psychotropic medication in nursing home residents.
We report the comparison of cross-sectional data of psychotropic medication prescription rates from 3 large studies including nursing home residents in Germany and Austria. We aimed to compare the prevalence of (1) psychotropic medication, (2) different classes of psychotropic medication, (3) psychotropic medication administered for bedtime use, and (4) associations between prescription of psychotropics and institutional and residents' characteristics. Confidence intervals of prevalences and multiple logistic regression analyses were adjusted for cluster correlation.
Data from 5336 residents in 136 long term care facilities were included. In Austria, 74.6% (95% CI 72.0-77.2%) of all residents had a prescription of at least one psychotropic medication compared to Germany with about 51.8% (95% CI 48.3-55.2%) and 52.4% (95% CI 48.7-56.1%). Of all antipsychotics, 66% (Austria) and 47% (Germany) were prescribed for bedtime use. Most prescriptions were conventional, low-potency antipsychotics. In all 3 studies, there was no statistically significant association between psychotropic medication prescription and nursing home characteristics. On the level of residents, consistent positive associations were found for higher level of care dependency and permanent restlessness. Consistent negative associations were found for older age and male gender.

12405546",Prediction of preclinical Alzheimer's disease: longitudinal rates of change in cognition.,"Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (pAD) reflects neuropathological findings of AD in cognitively normal subjects. The present study represents an effort to determine if differences could be identified in the longitudinal patterns of cognitive performance in persons classified as pAD compared to those who did not meet criteria for AD at autopsy. We included 121 subjects who were cognitively normal from baseline through their last assessment before death and who underwent autopsy. Participants were classified into two groups: pathologically normal (PN; NIA-Reagan low or no-likelihood of AD, n = 89) and preclinical AD (pAD; NIA-Reagan criteria of intermediate or high-likelihood of AD in the absence of clinical dementia symptoms, n = 32) followed for a mean 7.5 years prior to death. Longitudinal rates and patterns of change in scores on a standard cognitive battery were compared between these two groups. While cognitive results at baseline and last evaluations revealed no clear cross sectional group differences after adjustment for age, ApoE status, education, and gender, statistically significant differences between the pAD and PN groups in slope of decline were seen on a composite score of cognitive function. Further analyses showed three components of this score reached significance: constructional praxis, delayed recall of a word list, and category verbal fluency.

214,21348283,[Actual situation and characteristics of clients judged to need home-visiting nurse services by certified care managers and comparison of users and non-users of such services].,"To investigate the actual situation and characteristics of clients judged to need home-visit nurse services (HN) by certified care managers and to compare the characteristics of users of HN to those of non-users of HN, so that appropriate use of HN can be encouraged.
The participants were all certified care managers working at 57 care management offices in 4 cities in prefecture A. They were asked to fill out questionnaires for each of their clients whose degree of care was 2 or greater between November 2005 and February 2006. The items in the questionnaire included client's age, sex, degree of care, level of activity of daily living (ADL), dementia level, presence of a caregiver, necessity of HN, the actual use of HN. The dependent variables for analysis (univariate analysis and logistic regression) were the necessity of HN, and the actual use of HN among the clients needing HN.
Forty care management offices (70.2%) responded to our survey and the number of filled questionnaires was 1,288, providing a final sample of 1,224 clients. Care managers judged 537 clients as needing HN, and 328 actually used HN. The clients who needed HN were younger and more dependent for ADL, and had more severe care degree, higher rates of medical treatment, neurological disease, hospitalization during the previous 6 months, no cohabiter, no caregiver, and a caregiver aged 75 years or more, than the clients who did not need HN. Among the clients who were judged as needing HN by the care managers, the actual users were only 59.0% and these had higher rates of medical treatment and a dementia level of 1 or no dementia than non-users.
Of the clients who were judged as needing HN by the care managers, only 59.0% used HN. The necessity of HN was related to many variables such as medical condition and status of the caregiver. The actual users tended to be dependent for ADL and to need medical treatment, and moderately or severely demented clients were not likely to use HN. The reasons why some clients did not use HN despite necessity might be the lack of knowledge or cognition, and competition with other services. Strategies for encouraging use of HN should be developed.",[],[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health,2011-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Nagata', 'firstname': 'Satoko', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Health Nursing, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.'}, {'lastname': 'Taguchi', 'firstname': 'Atsuko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Naruse', 'firstname': 'Takashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kuwahara', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Murashima', 'firstname': 'Sachiyo', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Of the clients who were judged as needing HN by the care managers, only 59.0% used HN.

215,21194100,Over- and under-diagnosis of dementia in ethnic minorities: a nationwide register-based study.,"Among dementia professionals in several European countries, it is believed that dementia is under-diagnosed and under-treated to a greater extent among ethnic minorities than in the native population. It is unknown whether this belief holds true. The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of register-based dementia diagnoses in the largest ethnic minority groups in Denmark with the prevalence of register-based dementia diagnoses in the general Danish population.
By linking the Danish hospital registers with the Danish Civil Registration System, nationwide dementia cases for three main ethnic minorities were identified. Age- and gender-specific prevalence rates for dementia were calculated and compared to previously published data for the general population.
The study population consisted of 68 219 persons aged 20 and older. A total of 174 dementia cases were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 57.7 years (SD = 16.2). Compared to the general population, there was a higher prevalence of dementia among those younger than 60 years, and a markedly lower prevalence of dementia among those 60 years and older.
Dementia is under-diagnosed to a greater extent among ethnic minorities in the age group 60 years and older but is over-diagnosed in the age group younger than 60 years. Several factors may contribute to this pattern, including cultural differences in help-seeking behaviour, and problems in navigating the health-care system. Furthermore, cross-cultural assessment of dementia can be difficult because of language barriers and cultural differences.",[],International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2011-01-05,"[{'lastname': 'Nielsen', 'firstname': 'T R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Memory Disorders Research Group, Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. rune.nielsen@rh.regionh.dk'}, {'lastname': 'Vogel', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Phung', 'firstname': 'T K T', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gade', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Waldemar', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The study population consisted of 68 219 persons aged 20 and older.

216,21181717,Increased brain atrophy rates in cognitively normal older adults with low cerebrospinal fluid Aβ1-42.,"To identify cognitively normal individuals at risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42, and to determine rates of cerebral atrophy.
Control subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with CSF and serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were dichotomized on CSF Aβ1-42 (normal control [NC]-high > 192 pg/ml; NC-low ≤ 192 pg/ml). Baseline and 1-year MRIs were registered, and brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes and annualized volume changes were calculated. Baseline characteristics, CSF profiles, neuropsychology, brain volumes and atrophy rates, and APOE, PICALM, CLU, and TOMM40 genotypes were compared. Sample sizes to power presymptomatic clinical trials based on rate of atrophy were calculated.
Forty of 105 (38%) were classified as NC-low, and 65 (62%) as NC-high. There were no differences in age (76.3 ± 5.1 vs 74.9 ± 5.1 years), gender, brain volumes, and all but 1 cognitive score (Trails B; p = 0.015). The NC-low group had higher tau (p = 0.005) and p-tau (p < 0.001), and was more likely to be APOE4 positive (48% vs 11%, p < 0.001). The NC-low group had significantly higher whole brain loss (9.3 vs 4.4 ml/yr, p < 0.001), ventricular expansion (2.04 vs 0.95 ml/yr, p = 0.002), and hippocampal atrophy rate (0.07 vs 0.03 ml/yr, p = 0.029). Baseline Aβ1-42 level was strongly correlated with rate of brain atrophy only in the NC-low group (p < 0.001). Using 141 (95% confidence interval, 86-287) patients per arm provides 80% power in a 1-year treatment trial to show 25% slowing of brain atrophy in the NC-low group.
A significant percentage of healthy older adults have CSF profiles consistent with AD and increased rates of brain atrophy, suggesting that they may be in the earliest stages of neurodegeneration.

10668686","Utilization of antihypertensives, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hormones in Alzheimer disease.","This study explores the longitudinal relationship between patient characteristics and use of 4 drug classes (antihypertensives, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hormones) that showed significant changes in use rates over time in patients with Alzheimer disease. Patient/caregiver-reported prescription medication usage was categorized by drug class for 201 patients from the Predictors Study. Patient characteristics included use of cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine, function, cognition, living situation, baseline age, and sex. Assessment interval, year of study entry, and site were controlled for. Before adjusting for covariates, useage increased for antihypertensives (47.8% to 62.2%), antipsychotics (3.5% to 27.0%), and antidepressants (32.3% to 40.5%); use of hormones decreased (19.4% to 5.4%). After controlling for patient characteristics, effects of time on the use of antidepressants were no longer significant. Antihypertensive use was associated with poorer functioning, concurrent use of memantine, and older age. Antipsychotic use was associated with poorer functioning and poorer cognition. Antidepressant use was associated with younger age, poorer functioning, and concurrent use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Hormone use was associated with being female and younger age. Findings suggest accurate modeling of the Alzheimer disease treatment paradigm for certain subgroups of patients should include antihypertensives and antipsychotics in addition to cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.",[],Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,2010-10-27,"[{'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Carolyn W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC) and Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Center for Study of Health Care across Systems and Sites of Care, James J.

218,20710011,Systemic energy homeostasis in Huntington's disease patients.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an increased number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. Apart from neurological impairment, the disease is also accompanied by progressive weight loss, abnormalities in fat and glucose homeostasis and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, the causes of which are unknown. Therefore, a detailed analysis of systemic energy homeostasis in HD patients in relation to disease characteristics was performed.
Indirect calorimetry combined with a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp with stable isotopes ([6,6-2H2]-glucose and [2H5]- glycerol) was performed to assess energy expenditure and glucose and fat metabolism in nine early stage, medication free HD patients and nine age, sex and body mass index matched controls.
Compared with controls, fasting energy expenditure was higher in HD patients (1616 ± 72 vs 1883 ± 93 kcal/24 h, p=0.037) and increased even further after insulin stimulation (1667 ± 87 vs 2068 ± 122 kcal/24 h, p=0.016). During both basal and hyperinsulinaemic conditions, glucose and glycerol disposal rates, endogenous glucose production and hepatic insulin sensitivity were similar between HD patients and controls. In HD patients, energy expenditure increased with disease duration but not with a greater degree of motor or functional impairment. Moreover, a higher mutant CAG repeat size was associated with lower insulin sensitivity (r=-0.84, p=0.018).
These findings suggest sympathetic hyperactivity as an underlying mechanism of increased energy expenditure in HD, as well as peripheral polyglutamine length dependent interference of mutant huntingtin with insulin signalling that may become clinically relevant in carriers of mutations with large CAG repeat sizes.",[],"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2010-08-17,"[{'lastname': 'Aziz', 'firstname': 'N Ahmad', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre, K-05-Q 110, PO Box 9600, Albinusdreef 2, Leiden 2300 RC, The Netherlands. n.a.aziz@lumc.nl'}, {'lastname': 'Pijl', 'firstname': 'Hanno', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Frölich', 'firstname': 'Marijke', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Snel', 'firstname': 'Marieke', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Streefland', 'firstname': 'Trea C M', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roelfsema', 'firstname': 'Ferdinand', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roos', 'firstname': 'Raymund A C', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': None}]",,"These findings suggest sympathetic hyperactivity as an underlying mechanism of increased energy expenditure in HD, as well as peripheral polyglutamine length dependent interference of mutant huntingtin with insulin signalling that may become clinically relevant in carriers of mutations with large CAG repeat sizes.","Compared with controls, fasting energy expenditure was higher in HD patients (1616 ± 72 vs 1883 ± 93 kcal/24 h, p=0.037) and increased even further after insulin stimulation (1667 ± 87 vs 2068 ± 122 kcal/24 h, p=0.016).

219,20666661,Long and short hospice stays among nursing home residents at the end of life.,"To identify characteristics of nursing homes and residents associated with particularly long or short hospice stays.
Observational study using administrative data on resident characteristics and hospice utilization from a large regional hospice linked with publicly available data on nursing home characteristics.
A total of 13,479 residents who enrolled in hospice during 2001-2008.
Logistic regression models of the probability of a long (>180 days) or very short (<or=3 days) stay, adjusting for nursing home characteristics, a measure of nursing home quality developed using Minimum Data Set Quality Indicator/Quality Measures data, and resident characteristics.
Nursing home characteristics were not statistically significant predictors of long stays. The probability of a short stay increased with the facility's nurse staffing ratio and decreased with the share of residents covered by Medicaid. Men (relative to women) and blacks (relative to whites) were less likely to have a long stay and more likely to have a short stay, while those 70 years or younger (relative to those 81-90) and residents with Alzheimer's disease/dementia were more likely to have long stays and less likely to have short stays. Fourteen percent of hospice users were discharged before death because they failed to meet Medicare hospice eligibility criteria, and these residents had longer lengths of stay, on average.
Few facility characteristics were associated with very long or very short hospice stays.

19631572",Sex and age differences in atrophic rates: an ADNI study with n=1368 MRI scans.,"We set out to determine factors that influence the rate of brain atrophy in 1-year longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. With tensor-based morphometry (TBM), we mapped the 3-dimensional profile of progressive atrophy in 144 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) (age: 76.5 +/- 7.4 years), 338 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 76.0 +/- 7.2), and 202 healthy controls (77.0 +/- 5.1), scanned twice, 1 year apart. Statistical maps revealed significant age and sex differences in atrophic rates. Brain atrophic rates were about 1%-1.5% faster in women than men. Atrophy was faster in younger than older subjects, most prominently in mild cognitive impairment, with a 1% increase in the rates of atrophy and 2% in ventricular expansion, for every 10-year decrease in age. TBM-derived atrophic rates correlated with reduced beta-amyloid and elevated tau levels (n = 363) at baseline, baseline and progressive deterioration in clinical measures, and increasing numbers of risk alleles for the ApoE4 gene.

221,20307170,Patterns of antipsychotic medication use in Australia 2002-2007.,"Atypical antipsychotic medications that are primarily used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder cost the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) AUD$334.4m in 2007. There are indications that they have also been used outside the approved indications to treat behavioural disturbances in the elderly. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine (i) trends in prescribing of subsidized atypical antipsychotic drugs in the Australian population from 2002 to 2007; and (ii) gender and age differences in the utilization of these drugs.
Government (Medicare Australia) data on numbers of prescriptions, quantity and doses for atypical and typical antipsychotics from 2002 to 2007 were analysed. Defined daily dose per 1000 population per day were estimated for age and sex groups using Australian Bureau of Statistics population data.
The proportion of prescribed antipsychotics that were atypical increased from 61% in 2002 to 77% in 2007. In male subjects, olanzapine was most often prescribed between the ages of 25 and 55 years. In female subjects, in contrast, the highest rates of prescribing were in those > or = 75 years. Lower doses of these drugs were prescribed in older adults.
Atypical antipsychotic drugs were most commonly used to treat schizophrenia in younger men and behavioural disturbances in older women with dementia.

11446903",Geographic variation in one-year recurrent ischemic stroke rates for elderly Medicare beneficiaries in the USA.,"While geographic disparities in stroke mortality are well documented, there are no data describing geographic variation in recurrent stroke. Accordingly, we evaluated geographic variations in 1-year recurrent ischemic stroke rates in the USA with adjustment for patient characteristics.
One-year recurrent stroke rates for ischemic stroke (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes 433, 434 and 436) following hospital discharge were calculated by county for all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from 2000 to 2002. The rates were standardized and smoothed using a bayesian conditional autoregressive model that was risk-standardized for patients' age, gender, race/ethnicity, prior hospitalizations, Deyo comorbidity score, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, dementia, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity.
The overall 1-year recurrent stroke rate was 9.4% among 895,916 ischemic stroke patients (mean age: 78 years; 56.6% women; 86.6% White, 9.7% Black and 1.2% Latino/Hispanic). The rates varied by geographic region and were highest in the South and in parts of the West and Midwest. Regional variation was present for all racial/ethnic subgroups and persisted after adjustment for individual patient characteristics.
Almost 1 in 10 hospitalized ischemic stroke patients was readmitted for an ischemic stroke within 1 year. There was heterogeneity in recurrence patterns by geographic region. Further work is needed to understand the reasons for this regional variability.",[],Neuroepidemiology,2010-01-14,"[{'lastname': 'Allen', 'firstname': 'Norrina B', 'initials': 'NB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,CT 06520-8034, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Holford', 'firstname': 'Theodore R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bracken', 'firstname': 'Michael B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Goldstein', 'firstname': 'Larry B', 'initials': 'LB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Howard', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lichtman', 'firstname': 'Judith H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The overall 1-year recurrent stroke rate was 9.4% among 895,916 ischemic stroke patients (mean age: 78 years; 56.6% women; 86.6% White, 9.7% Black and 1.2% Latino/Hispanic).

223,20042544,Occurrence risk and structure of depression in Parkinson disease with and without dementia: results from the GEPAD Study.,"This study examined the age- and gender-specific risk of depression in demented and non-demented participants, its symptom structure, and associated clinical factors in a nationwide random sample of n = 1449 outpatients with Parkinson disease (PD).
Depression ratings were based on a cross-sectional clinical assessment including the clinical Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS > or = 14). Parkinson disease severity was rated according to Hoehn and Yahr (HY) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Diagnosis of dementia was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition; DSM-IV) criteria.
25.2% (CI: 22.8-27.5) of all patients met study criteria for depression. Additionally, 8.4% of patients did not exceed the MADRS cut-off but were currently being treated with antidepressants, possibly suggesting a corrected (upper limit) total prevalence of 33.6%. Females were more likely depressive than males (29.3% vs 22.4%). In both genders, depression risk was elevated 2- to 4-fold depending on HY stage. Overall, highest rates in non-demented patients were found in females at stages IV to V (53.7%, CI: 37.7-69.6). Demented patients were more likely to meet depression criteria than non-demented (up to 76.2%, 95% CI: 60.5-87.9). Depression symptom profiles for demented PD patients (as compared to non-demented) revealed no structural differences but consistently higher symptom scores. Neither age at onset of PD nor duration of disease were significantly linked with depression.
Depression rates are already substantially elevated at early PD stages, emphasizing the need for a thorough examination of mood disorders in all patients with PD. Depression is associated with PD severity and dementia but not with age, age at onset of PD, or disease duration. The differential associations with dementia and the statistical independence of dementia and depression also suggest that depression could not be regarded as a mere demoralisation syndrome.",[],Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,2010-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Riedel', 'firstname': 'Oliver', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Dresden, Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heuser', 'firstname': 'Isabella', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klotsche', 'firstname': 'Jens', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dodel', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wittchen', 'firstname': 'Hans-Ulrich', 'initials': 'HU', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,"25.2% (CI: 22.8-27.5) of all patients met study criteria for depression.

225,19845749,Growth hormone and ghrelin secretion are associated with clinical severity in Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an increased CAG repeat size in the huntingtin gene. Apart from neurological impairment, the disease is also accompanied by progressive weight loss, abnormalities in glucose homeostasis and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, which may partly be caused by disturbed growth hormone (GH) and ghrelin secretion. Therefore, we aimed to perform a detailed analysis of GH and ghrelin secretion in HD patients in relation to clinical signs and symptoms.
In nine early-stage, medication-free HD patients and nine age-, gender- and body mass index-matched controls, we measured serum GH levels every 10 min for 24 h and assessed ghrelin response to food intake. Multi-parameter auto-deconvolution and approximate entropy analysis were applied to quantify basal, pulsatile, and total GH secretion rates as well as the regularity of GH secretion.
We found no significant differences in GH and ghrelin secretion characteristics between HD patients and controls (total GH secretion: 137 +/- 36 vs. 181 +/- 43 mU/l/24 h, respectively; P = 0.439). However, in HD patients, both GH secretion and its irregularity as well as the degree of postprandial ghrelin suppression significantly increased with worsening motor and functional impairment (all P < 0.05). Moreover, postprandial ghrelin suppression also increased with decreasing body weight and higher CAG repeat number (both P < 0.05).

226,19818568,"Stroke-related dementia: rates, risk factors and implications for future research.","Stroke is a risk factor for dementia and dementia predisposes to stroke. Dementia prevalence in subjects with stroke is comparable to that seen in stroke-free subjects who are 10 years older. However, until recently the prevalence, time course and risk factors for dementia in relation to the occurrence of stroke was unclear owing to conflicting reports from individual studies. Data now available from a meta-analysis of studies of pre- and post-stroke dementia, show that heterogeneity between individual studies is largely explained by study methods and case-mix. Pooled dementia estimates are consistent with 1-in-10 patients being demented prior to first stroke, 1-in-10 developing new dementia soon after first stroke, and over 1-in-3 being demented after a recurrent stroke. After the first year, cumulative incidence of dementia is little greater than expected on the basis of recurrent stroke alone. Medial temporal lobe atrophy, female sex and family history, are more strongly associated with pre-stroke dementia, whereas the characteristics and complications of the stroke and the presence of multiple lesions in time and place are more strongly associated with post-stroke dementia, indicating the likely impact of optimal acute stroke care and secondary prevention in reducing the burden of dementia.

227,19782001,"Prevalence, incidence, and factors associated with pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Reliable data on the prevalence and predictors of post-stroke dementia are needed to inform patients and carers, plan services and clinical trials, ascertain the overall burden of stroke, and understand its causes. However, published data on the prevalence and risk factors for pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia are conflicting. We undertook this systematic review to assess the heterogeneity in the reported rates and to identify risk factors for pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia.
Studies published between 1950 and May 1, 2009, were identified from bibliographic databases, reference lists, and journal contents pages. Studies were included if they were on patients with symptomatic stroke, were published in English, reported on a series of consecutive eligible patients or volunteers in prospective cohort studies, included all stroke or all ischaemic stroke, measured dementia by standard criteria, and followed up patients for at least 3 months after stroke. Pooled rates of dementia were stratified by study setting, inclusion or exclusion of pre-stroke dementia, and by first, any, or recurrent stroke. Pooled odds ratios were calculated for factors associated with pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia.
We identified 22 hospital-based and eight population-based eligible cohorts (7511 patients) described in 73 papers. The pooled prevalence of pre-stroke dementia was higher (14.4%, 95% CI 12.0-16.8) in hospital-based studies than in population-based studies (9.1%, 6.9-11.3). Although post-stroke (<or=1 year) dementia rates were heterogeneous overall, 93% of the variance was explained by study methods and case mix; the rates ranged from 7.4% (4.8-10.0) in population-based studies of first-ever stroke in which pre-stroke dementia was excluded to 41.3% (29.6-53.1) in hospital-based studies of recurrent stroke in which pre-stroke dementia was included. The cumulative incidence of dementia after the first year was little greater (3.0%, 1.3-4.7) per year in hospital-based studies than expected on the basis of recurrent stroke alone. Medial temporal lobe atrophy, female sex, and a family history of dementia were strongly associated with pre-stroke dementia, whereas the characteristics and complications of the stroke and the presence of multiple lesions in time and place were more strongly associated with post-stroke dementia.
After study methods and case mix are taken into account, reported estimates of the prevalence of dementia are consistent: 10% of patients had dementia before first stroke, 10% developed new dementia soon after first stroke, and more than a third had dementia after recurrent stroke. The strong association of post-stroke dementia with multiple strokes and the prognostic value of other stroke characteristics highlight the central causal role of stroke itself as opposed to the underlying vascular risk factors and, thus, the likely effect of optimum acute stroke care and secondary prevention in reducing the burden of dementia.

American studies reported equal rates whereas European ones showed higher rates in women. Observational studies on hormone replacement therapy showed that treated women had a lower risk than untreated ones. Two large clinical trials in menopausal women did not find any protective effect of therapy with oestrogens or oestrogens plus progestinic hormones. However, as regards a potential protective role of female gonadal hormones on brain neurodegenerative diseases, this result cannot be considered conclusive since a large cohort study showed an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women who underwent early oophorectomy. A possible gender difference in the risk of AD is further supported by recent evidence suggesting that the brain's so-called cognitive reserve is reduced in women. The area of gender differences in AD and in neurodegenerative processes generally, although still largely unexplored, appears to offer great promise for the future development of better strategies of intervention for patients.",[],Functional neurology,2009-09-25,"[{'lastname': 'Musicco', 'firstname': 'Massimo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council (ITB-CNR), Segrate, Milan, Italy. m.musicco@hsantalucia.it'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbec9c20>,,,,,,
229,19766953,Determinants of antidepressant medication prescribing in elderly residents of aged care homes in Australia: a retrospective study.,"Depression is underrecognized and poorly treated among older people living in aged care homes worldwide. Depression has been associated with higher rates of recurrence, disability, and death in older people.
The primary objective of this study was to assess the determinants of antidepressant medication prescribing among older people living in aged care homes in Australia. A further objective was to investigate the anti-depressant medications in common use, doses of antidepressants, and concurrent pharmacotherapy among people receiving antidepressants.
A random sample of 500 deidentified medication review reports was extracted from a database containing >165,000 Residential Medication Management Review reports. Residents' demographic and clinical characteristics, medical diagnoses, and prescribed medications were systematically extracted from these reports. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with the prescribing of any antidepressant, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and ""other"" antidepressants (eg, mianserin, mirtazapine, venlafaxine).
The mean (SD) age of the residents was 84.0 (9.0) years. Seventy-five percent were female. The prevalence of antidepressant prescribing among these aged care home residents was 33.0%. SSRIs were more commonly prescribed than TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other antidepressants. Antidepressants were more likely to be prescribed in people treated for dementia with mood disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 9.70; 95% CI, 5.26-17.88), depression (OR = 13.28; 95% CI, 6.44-27.36), and Parkinson's disease (OR = 3.56; 95% CI, 1.37-9.23). SSRI prescribing was associated with dementia with mood disorder (OR = 5.85; 95% CI, 3.19-10.72) and depression (OR = 6.44; 95% CI, 3.38-12.26). TCA prescribing was associated with depression (OR = 2.95; 95% CI, 1.18-7.35) and concurrent benzodiazepine use (OR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.03-5.72). Other antidepressant prescribing was associated with dementia with mood disorder (OR = 6.53; 95% CI, 3.15-13.50) and depression (OR = 5.00; 95% CI, 2.23-11.19).
There was preferential prescribing of SSRI antidepressants among these older aged care home residents with depression.

230,19734513,Predicting mortality of psychogeriatric patients: a simple prognostic frailty risk score.,"Frailty and mortality in psychogeriatric patients are hard to predict but important in counselling and therapeutic decision making. We have therefore developed a simple frailty risk score to predict mortality this population.
Prospective observational study including 401 community dwelling psychogeriatric patients (249 women; mean (SD) age 78.0 (6.5) years), who had been referred to a multidisciplinary diagnostic observation centre. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify and select baseline characteristics for the development and validation of a risk score for the prediction of 3 year mortality.
A total of 116 subjects died during follow-up (median follow-up duration of 26 months). Baseline characteristics associated with mortality were: age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI)1.02 to 2.04), male sex (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.59), living alone (HR 1.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.38), body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m(2) (HR 4.09, 95% CI 2.06 to 8.14), cardiovascular disease (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.15), elderly mobility score <20 (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.98), number of medicines > or =2 (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.31), and impaired motor (HR 1.47, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.32) and process skills (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.98) in activities of daily living. These predictors were translated into an easy-to-use frailty risk score and patients were stratified into very good (<45 points), good (45-50) moderate (51-55), poor (56-61) and very poor (>61) prognosis groups.

231,19697887,[Oldest-old dementia in a Japanese memory clinic].,"To elucidate the characteristics of oldest-old patients with dementia in a Japanese memory clinic.
We evaluated 365 consecutive patients with dementia who were referred to the Memory Clinic of Niigata Rehabilitation Hospital, Niigata, Japan over 4-year period. More than 85% of the patients lived in the communities within 15 km from the hospital. The mean (+/- SD) age at examination was 79.3 +/- 6.9 years, and according to this criterion the patients were classified into 4 groups: young (age less than 65 years), younger-old (65-74 years), older-old (75-84 years), oldest-old (85 years or more). In each patient group, we evaluated the rates of the major dementias and compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The rates of major dementias in all the patients was as follows: AD, 74.5%; dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 13.7%; frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 3.0%; vascular dementia (VD), 5.5%, and other dementias, 3.3%. The number of patients included in the young group was 9; in the younger-old group, 75; in the older-old group, 203; and in the oldest-old group, 78. The rates of major dementias in each old group was as follows: in the younger-old group, 74.7% for AD, 9.3% for DLB, 6.7% for FTLD, 5.3% for VD and 4.0% for other dementias; in the older-old group, 73.4% for AD, 15.8% for DLB, 1.5% for FTLD, 5.9% for VD, and 3.5% for other dementias; and in the oldest-old group, 78.2% for AD, 14.1% for DLB, 2.6% for FTLD, 3.9% for VD and 1.3% for other dementia. The AD patients in the oldest-old group showed a significantly higher rate of female (younger-old, 64.3%; older-old, 79.2%; and oldest-old, 85.3%; chi2 = 7.9, p < .05), a poorest mean of the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (younger-old, 18.5 +/- 10.4; older-old, 19.2 +/- 9.3; and oldest-old, 22.8 +/- 7.6; F = 3.5, p < .05), and a poorest distribution on the Clinical Dementia Rating (chi2 = 13.9, p < .05).
The rates of the major dementias were similar in the younger-, older-, and oldest-old groups except for the higher rate of FTLD and the lower rate of DLB, respectively, in the younger-old patients.

This study provides a systematic review of gender-differences in predictors of NHP from population-based, longitudinal studies worldwide.
Relevant articles were identified by a systematic search of literature. The articles based on prospective studies with representative samples of community-living elders identified predictors by gender-specific multivariate analyses.
Eleven studies were identified. We found gender differences in the prediction of NHP for marital status, living situation, housing and car availability and urinary incontinence. For both genders the risk of NHP did not differ substantially for age, functional impairment, cognitive impairment, dementia, and depression. The male to female ratio of admission rates ranged between 1 to 1.4 and 1 to 1.6.
Only a few studies analyzed gender-specific predictors of NHP, probably owing to the associated statistical difficulties.

233,19435758,Variation in care home admission across areas of Northern Ireland.,"much has been written about the demographic and health characteristics which act as risk factors for care home admission in the UK. However, few studies have examined variation in care home admission rates across areas, whilst controlling for the demographic and health characteristics of the individuals living within these areas. This is surprising given that decisions which affect admission are often taken at the local level. The aim of the study was to determine if there were variations in care home admission rates across trusts in Northern Ireland, once adjustment had been made for the demographic and health characteristics of the individuals residing within these areas.
a retrospective cohort study was undertaken, using data from the Data Retrieval in General Practice (DRGP) project in Northern Ireland, to identify a cohort of individuals aged 65 and over and living in the community at the outset of the study. A total of 28,064 individuals were followed up for 5 years to identify those who subsequently entered a nursing or residential care home. Controlling for the demographic, household composition and health characteristics of individuals, Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios of care home admission for 10 trusts.
a total of 24,691 of the initial cohort had complete information for all variables and were included in the final analysis; 1,313 (5.3%) had entered a care home at the end of the 5 years of follow-up. Admission increased significantly with age, and diagnoses of dementia and stroke. Controlling for the age, sex and health composition of individuals, some variations in admission rates were found across trusts.
the study has highlighted the importance of age and clinical conditions as risk factors for care home admission. In addition, it appears that the area of residence might be important in determining a person's risk of care home admission. Such differences may be attributable to particular characteristics of the trust, such as the level of deprivation or degree of rurality, or to differing policies in relation to services for older people. More work is required to identify the causes of the differences to allow policies to be implemented to ensure equitable access to care homes across Northern Ireland.",[],Age and ageing,2009-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Connolly', 'firstname': 'Sheelah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Epidemiology and Public Health, Queen's University Belfast, Royal Victoria Hospital site, Belfast, UK. sheelah.connolly@qub.ac.uk""}, {'lastname': ""O'Reilly"", 'firstname': 'Dermot', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"a total of 24,691 of the initial cohort had complete information for all variables and were included in the final analysis; 1,313 (5.3%) had entered a care home at the end of the 5 years of follow-up.

To validate the diagnosis of self-reported stroke using stroke identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the standard.
Community-based cohort study of nondemented, ethnically diverse elderly persons in northern Manhattan.
High-resolution quantitative MRIs were acquired for 717 participants without dementia. Sensitivity and specificity of stroke by self-report were examined using cross-sectional analyses and the chi(2) test. Putative relationships between factors potentially influencing the reporting of stroke, including memory performance, cognitive function, and vascular risk factors, were assessed using logistic regression models. Subsequently, all analyses were repeated, stratified by age, sex, ethnic group, and level of education.
In analyses of the whole sample, sensitivity of stroke self-report for a diagnosis of stroke on MRI was 32.4%, and specificity was 78.9%. In analyses stratified by median age (80.1 years), the validity between reported stroke and detection of stroke on MRI was significantly better in the younger than the older age group (for all vascular territories: sensitivity and specificity, 36.7% and 81.3% vs 27.6% and 26.2%; P = .02). Impaired memory, cognitive skills, or language ability and the presence of hypertension or myocardial infarction were associated with higher rates of false-negative results.
Using brain MRI as the standard, specificity and sensitivity of stroke self-report are low. Accuracy of self-report is influenced by age, presence of vascular disease, and cognitive function.

16330791",Delirium accelerates cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease.,"To examine the impact of delirium on the trajectory of cognitive function in a cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).
A secondary analysis of data collected from a large prospective cohort, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center's patient registry, examined cognitive performance over time in patients who developed (n = 72) or did not develop (n = 336) delirium during the course of their illnesses. Cognitive performance was measured by change in score on the Information-Memory-Concentration (IMC) subtest of the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale. Delirium was identified using a previously validated chart review method. Using linear mixed regression models, rates of cognitive change were calculated, controlling for age, sex, education, comorbid medical diagnoses, family history of dementia, dementia severity score, and duration of symptoms before diagnosis.
A significant acceleration in the slope of cognitive decline occurs following an episode of delirium. Among patients who developed delirium, the average decline at baseline for performance on the IMC was 2.5 points per year, but after an episode of delirium there was further decline to an average of 4.9 points per year (p = 0.001). Across groups, the rate of change in IMC score occurred about three times faster in those who had delirium compared to those who did not.
Delirium can accelerate the trajectory of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).

236,19382111,At-risk alcohol drinking in primary care patients aged 75 years and older.,"Little is known about the prevalence and risk factors of alcohol problems among older people (especially those aged 75 years and more). The aims of this study were to report alcohol consumption patterns and to determine their association with socio-demographic variables and health characteristics.
3224 non-demented subjects aged 75 and over and attending general practitioners (GPs) (n = 138) in an urban area of Germany were studied by structured clinical interviews including detailed assessment of alcohol consumption patterns distinguishing between abstainers, moderate drinkers and at-risk drinkers (>20 g of alcohol for women and >30 g of alcohol for men).
A high proportion (50.1%) of the sample were abstainers, 43.4% were moderate drinkers. The prevalence of at-risk alcohol consumption was 6.5% (95% CI 5.6-7.4). Rates were significantly higher for men (12.1%; 95% CI 10.2-14.0) compared to women (3.6%; 95% CI 2.8-4.4). After full adjustment for confounding variables we found that compared to moderate drinking abstaining from alcohol was significantly associated with female gender, lower education, and mobility impairment. Compared to moderate drinking at-risk drinking was significantly higher among men, individuals with a liver disease, and current smokers.
Multivariate analysis revealed that, apart from liver disease, at-risk drinking in a non-demented population aged 75 and over was associated with relatively good physical and mental health.

238,19194887,Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate in Alzheimer's disease.,"Renal disease is increasingly regarded as an independent risk factor for vascular disease which in itself is believed to influence risk of AD. Alterations in amyloid homeostasis via reduced renal clearance of peripheral beta-amyloid (A|*beta*|) may represent another potential role for variation in renal function leading to increased risk of AD. We sought to examine estimates of glomerular filtration rate in AD and control groups.
AD patients were randomly recruited from the Memory Clinic of the Belfast City Hospital (n = 83). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leucocytes and was genotyped for Apolipoprotein E using standard methods. Using creatinine values, age and gender, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (eGFR) were calculated using the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation (using the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme (UKNEQAS) correction factor). IDMS eGFR values were then compared between AD and control groups.
Significant baseline differences in age, diastolic blood pressure, education level attained and APOE |*epsilon*|4 carriage were noted between cases and controls.

239,19191259,Prevalence of urinary incontinence and associated risk factors in nursing home residents: a systematic review.,"To determine not only prevalence rates of urinary incontinence (UI) in nursing home residents but also factors influencing these prevalence rates, and to provide an overview of risk factors associated with UI in this group.
A systematic review was performed using multiple databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library from January 1997 to April 2008. In addition, the bibliographies of all relevant articles were searched. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of all studies and extracted data on study design, population characteristics, definition of incontinence, measurement instrument, risk factors and prevalence rates.
Twelve articles containing 16 studies met the eligibility criteria. Prevalence rates of UI in nursing home residents ranged from 43% to 77% (median 58%). When comparing studies, the influencing factors on UI prevalence of age and sex were identified. In total 45 risk factors were described. Within individual study populations, sex, age, cognitive function, dementia, bedfast and locomotion were associated with UI.

A total of 24% of persons with dementia had at least 1 unattended exit; 4 participants exited multiple times. Men and younger persons with dementia were significantly more likely to exit than women or older individuals. A total of 30% of persons with dementia sustained injuries in 29 separate incidents; all but 3 injuries were caused by falls, and 38% of injuries resulted in nursing home placement.

242,18950367,Neuropsychological impairment and gender differences in HIV-1 infection.,"Research into neuropsychological consequences of HIV has focused mainly on male subjects, and therefore very little is known about the disease in female subjects and, of course, about gender differences. The aim of the present research was therefore to investigate neuropsychological impairment rates and pattern in HIV male and female patients, with regard to the study of gender differences in tasks assessing attention, memory for texts, digits and words, psychomotor speed, verbal intelligence and abstract reasoning.
A clinical sample was recruited consisting of 122 subjects, divided into four groups: (i) 57 HIV+ men; (ii) 31 HIV+ women; (iii) 18 HIV- men and (iv) 16 HIV- women. All the subjects had more than 18 years, being the average of age of 34.08 for men and 33.35 for women. The evaluation of each subject consisted of a semistructured interview investigating sociodemographic, clinical and toxicological aspects and a neuropsychological assessment, with a battery of tests specifically selected for this study and chosen for their validity and because they have been shown to be sensitive to neuropsychological impairment in HIV-infected patients in other studies.
None of HIV- male and female groups fulfilled impairment criteria. Regarding the HIV+ group, a rate of neuropsychological impairment of 51.9% was obtained for the men and 54.8% for the women, but there were no significant differences between groups. Nevertheless, were detected significant differences in neuropsychological impairment rates between HIV+ and HIV- women, and also between HIV+ and HIV- men. Although HIV+ women presented multiple factors that could increase their neuropsychological vulnerability to the effects of HIV, HIV+ men had the same probability of having neuropsychological impairment as HIV+ women.

243,18790458,Worldwide variation in the doubling time of Alzheimer's disease incidence rates.,"The doubling time is the number of chronological years for the age-specific incidence rate to double in magnitude. Doubling times describe the rate of increase of the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with advancing age. Estimates of doubling times of AD assist in understanding disease etiology and forecasting future disease prevalence. The objective of this study was to investigate regional and gender differences in the doubling of AD age-specific incidence rates.
We identified all studies in the peer review literature that reported age-specific incidence rates for AD. We modeled the logarithm of the incidence rate as a linear function of age. We used both fixed effects models and random effects models to account for interstudy variation.
AD incidence rates exponentially increase with increasing age. The overall estimate of the doubling time was 5.5 years. The doubling times from studies performed in North America and Europe were 6.0 and 5.8, respectively; whereas the doubling times in all other parts of the world were 5.0. There was no significant geographic differences in doubling times (P = .3). Although the doubling times were slightly longer for men (6.5 years) than for women (5.4 years), the difference was not significant (P = .3).
Doubling times of AD incidence rates are not statistically significantly different among populations throughout the world. The risk of AD grows exponentially with age, doubling approximately every 5 to 6 years. Although the shapes of the incidence curves are similar, there is considerable variation in absolute incidence rates throughout the world. Currently, there are limited epidemiologic data at the oldest ages, and further study is needed to accurately define the incidence curve above age 90.",[],Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2008-09-16,"[{'lastname': 'Ziegler-Graham', 'firstname': 'Kathryn', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Statistics Program, St Olaf College, Northfield, MN, USA. kziegler@stolaf.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Brookmeyer', 'firstname': 'Ron', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Arrighi', 'firstname': 'H Michael', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"AD incidence rates exponentially increase with increasing age.

1370068",Lifespan mental activity predicts diminished rate of hippocampal atrophy.,"Epidemiological studies suggest that complex mental activity may reduce the risk for dementia, however an underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our objective was to determine whether individual differences in lifespan complex mental activity are linked to altered rates of hippocampal atrophy independent of global measures of neurodegeneration.
Thirty seven healthy older individuals had their complex mental activity levels estimated using the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) and completed serial MRI investigations at baseline and three years follow-up. Hippocampal volume and semi-automatic quantitation of whole brain volume (WBV) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were compared at both time points.
Higher LEQ scores were correlated with hippocampal volume independent of covariates at the three year follow-up stage (r = 0.43, p = 0.012). Moreover, those with higher LEQ scores experienced less hippocampal atrophy over the follow-up period (r = 0.41, p = 0.02). High LEQ individuals had less than half the hippocampal volume decline of low LEQ individuals in a multivariate analysis (F = 4.47, p = 0.042). No parallel changes were found in measures of WBV and WMHs.
High level of complex mental activity across the lifespan was correlated with a reduced rate of hippocampal atrophy. This finding could not be explained by general differences in intracranial volume, larger hippocampi at baseline, presence of hypertensive disease, gender or low mood. Our results suggest that neuroprotection in medial temporal lobe may be one mechanism underlying the link between mental activity and lower rates of dementia observed in population-based studies.

12496303",Dementia and Medicare at life's end.,"To determine the effect of a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD), and the timing of first ADRD diagnosis, on Medicare expenditures at end of life.
Monthly Medicare payment data for the 5 years before death linked to the National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) for decedents between 1996 and 2000 (N=4,899).
Medicare payment data for the 5 years before death were used to compare 5-year and 6-month intervals of expenditures (total and six subcategories of services) for persons with and without a diagnosis of ADRD during the last 5 years of life, controlling for age, gender, race, education, comorbidities, and nursing home status. Covariate matching was used.
On average, ADRD diagnosis was not significantly associated with excess Medicare payments over the last 5 years of life. Regarding the timing of ADRD diagnosis, there were no significant 5-year total expenditure differences for persons diagnosed with dementia more than 1 year before death. Payment differences by 6-month intervals were highly sensitive to timing of ADRD diagnosis, with the highest differences occurring around the time of diagnosis. There were reduced, non-significant, or negative total payment differences after the initial diagnosis for those diagnosed at least 1 year before death. Only those diagnosed with ADRD in the last year of life had significantly higher Medicare payments during the last 12 months of life, primarily for acute care services.
ADRD has a smaller impact on total Medicare expenditures than previously reported in controlled studies. The significant differences occur primarily around the time of diagnosis. Although rates of dementia are increasing per se, our results suggest that long-term (1+ year) ADRD diagnoses do not contribute to greater total Medicare costs at the end of life.",[],Health services research,2008-03-29,"[{'lastname': 'Lamb', 'firstname': 'Vicki L', 'initials': 'VL', 'affiliation': 'North Carolina Central University, Department of Sociology, 1801 Fayetteville Street, Durham, NC 27707, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sloan', 'firstname': 'Frank A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nathan', 'firstname': 'Anil S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1475-6773.2007.00787.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe0c8b0>,,,,,,

12166542",Comparison of persistence rates of acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors in a state Medicaid program.,"To compare levels of persistency between cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) among a Medicaid patient population of older adults.
Survival analysis was used to assess differences in discontinuation between ChEIs (donepezil versus rivastigmine and galantamine), and for difference in patient gender, age, race, and care setting.
Rates of discontinuation increased from 42.7% (95% CI = 39.9-45.5) at 12 months to 84.8% (95% CI = 82.3-87.3) at 24 months. In multivariate models, no significant difference in discontinuation existed prior to 365 days. However, patients dispensed donepezil were less likely to discontinue as compared with users of the other two ChEIs after the first year (RR = 0.70; CI = 0.499-0.983; p < 0.04). Patients of white race were less likely to discontinue (RR = 0.549; 95% CI = 0.43-0.82; p = 0.0015), while gender, care setting, and age were not associated with discontinuation.
One-year persistence rates were similar between different ChEIs. Among patients persisting with ChEI medication for at least 12 months, users of donepezil were slightly more likely to continue to persist at 24 months. Nearly half of patients failed to persist with ChEI therapy for at least 12 months. Our findings underscore the limitations of the ChEI medications and the urgent need for effective and tolerable therapeutic options for patients having dementia.","['alzheimer’s disease', 'cholinesterase inhibitors', 'elderly', 'medicaid', 'persistence']",Patient preference and adherence,2008-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Abughosh', 'firstname': 'Susan M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (MCPHS), MA, USA;'}, {'lastname': 'Kogut', 'firstname': 'Stephen J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Rates of discontinuation increased from 42.7% (95% CI = 39.9-45.5) at 12 months to 84.8% (95% CI = 82.3-87.3) at 24 months.

7986176",Race/ethnic differences in AD survival in US Alzheimer's Disease Centers.,"Survival after Alzheimer disease (AD) is poorly understood for patients of diverse race/ethnic groups. We examined whether nonwhite AD patients (African American, Latino, Asian, American Indian) had different rates of survival compared with white AD patients.
The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) cataloged data from more than 30 Alzheimer's Disease Centers in the United States from 1984 to 2005. Patients aged 65 years or older with a diagnosis of possible/probable AD were included (n = 30,916). Survival was calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with a primary outcome of time to death. Secondary outcomes of this study were neuropathologic characteristics on an autopsied subsample (n = 3,017).
The 30,916 AD patients in the NACC were followed up for 2.4 +/- 2.9 years (mean age 77.6 +/- 6.5 years; 65% women; 19% nonwhite [12% African American, 4% Latino, 1.5% Asian, 0.5% American Indian, and 1% other]). Median survival was 4.8 years. African American and Latino AD patients had a lower adjusted hazard for mortality compared with white AD patients (African American hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; Latino HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69). Asians and American Indians had similar adjusted hazards for mortality compared with white AD patients (p > 0.10 for both).

248,17717416,An estimate of the prevalence of dementia among community-dwelling elderly in Israel.,"The study goal was to identify the prevalence of dementia among elderly people aged 65 and over living in the community in Israel. The target population included 47,834 community-dwelling elderly aged 65 and over in Jerusalem. Of this population, 1,624 elderly were randomly sampled according to ten strata of sex and age groups. The study included initial screening for 'suspected' dementia cases followed by in-depth clinical evaluation to determine whether an individual indeed suffered from dementia. One fifth (19.2%) of the elderly aged 65 and over, living in the community in Jerusalem, were found to have dementia at varying levels of severity. When the specific rates of elderly with dementia in the community in Jerusalem by gender and age groups were applied to data on the total elderly population in the community in Israel at the end of 2002, the prevalence of dementia was an estimated 16.7%. The percentage of elderly with dementia in Israel is in the upper range of rates quoted in other studies. The health and social service systems in Israel will have to make provisions to care for a much larger number of dementia sufferers than has been previously estimated.",[],Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,2007-08-25,"[{'lastname': 'Wertman', 'firstname': 'Eli', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute, Jerusalem, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Brodsky', 'firstname': 'Jenny', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'King', 'firstname': 'Yaron', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bentur', 'firstname': 'Netta', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chekhmir', 'firstname': 'Svetlana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1159/000107593,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbdd67c0>,,,,,,
249,36469653,Infection after total joint replacement of the hip and knee: research programme including the INFORM RCT,"People with severe osteoarthritis, other joint conditions or injury may have joint replacement to reduce pain and disability. In the UK in 2019, over 200,000 hip and knee replacements were performed. About 1 in 100 replacements becomes infected, and most people with infected replacements require further surgery.
To investigate why some patients are predisposed to joint infections and how this affects patients and the NHS, and to evaluate treatments.
Systematic reviews, joint registry analyses, qualitative interviews, a randomised controlled trial, health economic analyses and a discrete choice questionnaire.
Our studies are relevant to the NHS, to the Swedish health system and internationally.
People with prosthetic joint infection after hip or knee replacement and surgeons.
Revision of hip prosthetic joint infection with a single- or two-stage procedure.
Long-term patient-reported outcomes and reinfection. Cost-effectiveness of revision strategies over 18 months from two perspectives: health-care provider and Personal Social Services, and societal.
National Joint Registry; literature databases; published cohort studies; interviews with 67 patients and 35 surgeons; a patient discrete choice questionnaire; and the INFORM (INFection ORthopaedic Management) randomised trial.
Systematic reviews of studies reporting risk factors, diagnosis, treatment outcomes and cost comparisons. Individual patient data meta-analysis.
In registry analyses, about 0.62% and 0.75% of patients with hip and knee replacement, respectively, had joint infection requiring surgery. Rates were four times greater after aseptic revision. The costs of inpatient and day-case admissions in people with hip prosthetic joint infection were about five times higher than those in people with no infection, an additional cost of > £30,000. People described devastating effects of hip and knee prosthetic joint infection and treatment. In the treatment of hip prosthetic joint infection, a two-stage procedure with or without a cement spacer had a greater negative impact on patient well-being than a single- or two-stage procedure with a custom-made articulating spacer. Surgeons described the significant emotional impact of hip and knee prosthetic joint infection and the importance of a supportive multidisciplinary team. In systematic reviews and registry analyses, the risk factors for hip and knee prosthetic joint infection included male sex, diagnoses other than osteoarthritis, high body mass index, poor physical status, diabetes, dementia and liver disease. Evidence linking health-care setting and surgeon experience with prosthetic joint infection was inconsistent. Uncemented fixation, posterior approach and ceramic bearings were associated with lower infection risk after hip replacement. In our systematic review, synovial fluid alpha-defensin and leucocyte esterase showed high diagnostic accuracy for prosthetic joint infection. Systematic reviews and individual patient data meta-analysis showed similar reinfection outcomes in patients with hip or knee prosthetic joint infection treated with single- and two-stage revision. In registry analysis, there was a higher rate of early rerevision after single-stage revision for hip prosthetic joint infection, but, overall, 40% fewer operations are required as part of a single-stage procedure than as part of a two-stage procedure. The treatment of hip or knee prosthetic joint infection with early debridement and implant retention may be effective in > 60% of cases. In the INFORM randomised controlled trial, 140 patients with hip prosthetic joint infection were randomised to single- or two-stage revision. Eighteen months after randomisation, pain, function and stiffness were similar between the randomised groups (
Some research was specific to people with hip prosthetic joint infection. Study populations in meta-analyses and registry analyses may have been selected for joint replacement and specific treatments. The INFORM trial was not powered to study reinfection and was limited to 18 months’ follow-up. The qualitative study subgroups were small.
We identified risk factors, diagnostic biomarkers, effective treatments and patient preferences for the treatment of hip and knee prosthetic joint infection. The risk factors include male sex, diagnoses other than osteoarthritis, specific comorbidities and surgical factors. Synovial fluid alpha-defensin and leucocyte esterase showed high diagnostic accuracy. Infection is devastating for patients and surgeons, both of whom describe the need for support during treatment. Debridement and implant retention is effective, particularly if performed early. For infected hip replacements, single- and two-stage revision appear equally efficacious, but single-stage has better early results, is cost-effective at 18-month follow-up and is increasingly used. Patients prefer treatments that allow full functional return within 3–9 months.
For people with infection, develop information, counselling, peer support and care pathways. Develop supportive care and information for patients and health-care professionals to enable the early recognition of infections. Compare alternative and new treatment strategies in hip and knee prosthetic joint infection. Assess diagnostic methods and establish NHS diagnostic criteria.

250,17707846,Gender differences in dementia risk factors.,"With the aging of the population, dementia has become an important health concern in most countries. There is a growing body of literature on the importance of cardiovascular risk factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, and mixed dementia (AD with cerebrovascular disease).
This article reviews the role of major risk factors in dementia between both sexes.
The MEDLINE, PubMed, and HealthSTAR databases were searched between 1966 and January 2007 for English-language articles on the risk factors for dementia.
The distribution and prevalence of major risk factors between the sexes and age groups are varied. Female sex has been associated with increased risk of the development of AD. In women aged >75 years, rates of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are higher than in similarly aged men. Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genotype status appears to have a greater deleterious effect on gross hippocampal pathology and memory performance in women compared with men. Midlife hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in both sexes predict a higher risk of developing AD in later life. Diabetes is increasing in frequency to a greater extent in women than in men, and is associated with a substantial risk for cognitive impairment. Dementia in women (probably) and in men (possibly) is influenced by obesity in the middle of life.
It remains critical that large prospective clinical trials be designed to assess the effect of optimum management of vascular risk factors on cognitive functioning and dementia as the primary outcome, and include women and men in numbers adequate for assessment of gender effects.",[],Gender medicine,2007-08-21,"[{'lastname': 'Azad', 'firstname': 'Nahid A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Assessment Inpatient Unit, Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. nazad@ottawahospital.on.ca'}, {'lastname': 'Al Bugami', 'firstname': 'Muneerah', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Loy-English', 'firstname': 'Inge', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The distribution and prevalence of major risk factors between the sexes and age groups are varied.

251,17679672,The neuroprotective effects of caffeine: a prospective population study (the Three City Study).,"To examine the association between caffeine intake, cognitive decline, and incident dementia in a community-based sample of subjects aged 65 years and over.
Participants were 4,197 women and 2,820 men from a population-based cohort recruited from three French cities. Cognitive performance, clinical diagnosis of dementia, and caffeine consumption were evaluated at baseline and at 2 and 4 year follow-up.
Caffeine consumption is associated with a wide range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables which may also affect cognitive decline. Multivariate mixed models and multivariate adjusted logistic regression indicated that women with high rates of caffeine consumption (over three cups per day) showed less decline in verbal retrieval (OR = 0.67, CI = 0.53, 0.85), and to a lesser extent in visuospatial memory (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.65, 1.03) over 4 years than women consuming one cup or less. The protective effect of caffeine was observed to increase with age (OR = 0.73, CI = 0.53, 1.02 in the age range 65 to 74; OR = 0.3, CI = 0.14, 0.63 in the range 80+). No relation was found between caffeine intake and cognitive decline in men. Caffeine consumption did not reduce dementia risk over 4 years.
The psychostimulant properties of caffeine appear to reduce cognitive decline in women without dementia, especially at higher ages. Although no impact is observed on dementia incidence, further studies are required to ascertain whether caffeine may nonetheless be of potential use in prolonging the period of mild cognitive impairment in women prior to a diagnosis of dementia.",[],Neurology,2007-08-08,"[{'lastname': 'Ritchie', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'INSERM U888 Nervous System Pathologies, Epidemiological and Clinical Research, La Colombière Hospital, Montpellier, France. ritchie@montp.inserm.fr'}, {'lastname': 'Carrière', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de Mendonca', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Portet', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dartigues', 'firstname': 'J F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rouaud', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barberger-Gateau', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ancelin', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Caffeine consumption is associated with a wide range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables which may also affect cognitive decline.

The cost of management of stroke is extremely high. Thus, determination of controllable risk factors is important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors and the effects of risk factors on death rates, dependency, and stroke recurrence in hospitalised patients having first-ever stroke.
A total of 100 patients admitting to our hospital during the period April 2002 to March 2003 inclusive who were diagnosed as stroke according to WHO criteria were included in this study and evaluated prospectively.
The mean age of the patients was 66.7 +/- 9.9 years and 60% was male. 76 of the patients had ischaemic stroke; 24 had hemorrhagic stroke. The death rates were 12% in the first 28 days and 26% in 6 months. The best predictors of death rate in 6 months were stroke severity, living alone, and prestroke dementia.

7183759","Prevalence estimates of depression in elderly community-dwelling African Americans in Indianapolis and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria.","This is a community-based longitudinal epidemiological comparative study of elderly African Americans in Indianapolis and elderly Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria.
A two-stage study was designed in which community-based individuals were first screened using the Community Screening Interview for Dementia. The second stage was a full clinical assessment, which included use of the Geriatric Depression Scale, of a smaller sub-sample of individuals selected on the basis of their performance in the screening interview. Prevalence of depression was estimated using sampling weights according to the sampling stratification scheme for clinical assessment.
Some 2627 individuals were evaluated at the first stage in Indianapolis and 2806 in Ibadan. All were aged 69 years and over. Of these, 451 (17.2%) underwent clinical assessment in Indianapolis, while 605 (21.6%) were assessed in Ibadan. The prevalence estimates of both mild and severe depression were similar for the two sites (p=0.1273 and p=0.7093): 12.3% (mild depression) and 2.2% (severe depression) in Indianapolis and 19.8% and 1.6% respectively in Ibadan.

255,17495475,Frequency and clinical characteristics of early-onset dementia in consecutive patients in a memory clinic.,"To investigate the frequency, rate of causes of dementia, and clinical characteristics of early-onset dementia in consecutive patients of a memory clinic.
A total of 668 consecutive demented patients were involved in this study. We examined the distribution of patients' diagnosis, differences in sex, education, dementia severity and cognitive function at the first visit, and the duration from onset to consultation. We also examined the changes in the proportion of subjects during the research period.
There were 185 early-onset patients, 28% of all demented patients. No significant differences were observed between the early-onset and late-onset dementia groups in Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini-Mental State Examination score at the first consultation, but the duration from onset to consultation was significantly longer in the early-onset group. In the early-onset group, the rates of patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies were relatively low and the rate of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration was relatively high. There were no significant differences in the proportion between either demented subjects and nondemented subjects or early-onset dementia patients and late-onset dementia patients during the research period.

256,17456646,Gender differences in stroke risk among the elderly after coronary artery surgery.,"Previous studies have shown that women are at higher risk than men for stroke after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, but gender differences in systemic atherosclerosis have not been studied adequately. We investigated gender differences in the incidence of craniocervical and ascending aortic atherosclerosis and other risk factors for stroke in elderly patients (age > or =60 yr) undergoing CABG surgery.
Data were prospectively collected on 720 patients (31.8% women) undergoing CABG surgery. All patients underwent preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography to assess for prior cerebral infarctions, carotid artery stenosis, and intracranial arterial stenosis. Epiaortic ultrasound was performed at the time of surgery to assess for atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta. Cognitive status was measured using the Hasegawa-dementia score in all patients before surgery and on the seventh postoperative day.
Women were older and had more hypertension and intracranial arterial stenosis than did men. Men had significantly higher rates of hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, smoking history, severe carotid artery stenosis, and severe aortic atherosclerosis than did women. Although there were no differences in prior cerebral infarction or preoperative cognitive impairment, the rate of perioperative stroke was marginally higher in men than in women (3.9% vs 1.3%, P = 0.066). Univariate predictors of perioperative stroke were prior cerebral infarctions, ascending aortic atherosclerosis, preexisting cognitive impairment, and peripheral vascular disease. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that significant independent predictors of perioperative stroke were prior cerebral infarctions and aortic atherosclerosis.
These data suggest that men are more likely than women to have risk factors for stroke, including severe carotid artery stenosis, severe aortic atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease. The rates of prior cerebral infarction and preoperative cognitive impairment were similar between genders.",[],Anesthesia and analgesia,2007-04-26,"[{'lastname': 'Goto', 'firstname': 'Tomoko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Kumamoto Chuo Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan. togoto@bronze.ocn.ne.jp'}, {'lastname': 'Baba', 'firstname': 'Tomoko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ito', 'firstname': 'Asuka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maekawa', 'firstname': 'Kengo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koshiji', 'firstname': 'Takaaki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Women were older and had more hypertension and intracranial arterial stenosis than did men.

8811682",Rates of cerebral atrophy differ in different degenerative pathologies.,"Neurodegenerative disorders are pathologically characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain. It is likely that future treatment trials will target the underlying protein biochemistry and it is therefore increasingly important to be able to distinguish between different pathologies during life. The aim of this study was to determine whether rates of brain atrophy differ in neurodegenerative dementias that vary by pathological diagnoses and characteristic protein biochemistry. Fifty-six autopsied subjects were identified with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and two serial head MRI. Subjects were subdivided based on pathological diagnoses into Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive changes (FTLD-U), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Twenty-five controls were matched by age, gender and scan interval, to the study cohort. The boundary-shift integral was used to calculate change over time in whole brain (BBSI) and ventricular volume (VBSI). All BSI results were annualized by adjusting for scan interval. The rates of whole brain atrophy and ventricular expansion were significantly increased compared to controls in the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, FTLD-U, CBD and PSP groups. However, atrophy rates in the DLB group were not significantly different from control rates of atrophy. The largest rates of atrophy were observed in the CBD group which had a BBSI of 2.3% and VBSI of 16.2%. The CBD group had significantly greater rates of BBSI and VBSI than the DLB, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, Alzheimer's disease and PSP groups, with a similar trend observed when compared to the FTLD-U group. The FTLD-U group showed the next largest rates with a BBSI of 1.7% and VBSI of 9.6% which were both significantly greater than the DLB group. There was no significant difference in the rates of atrophy between the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and PSP groups, which all showed similar rates of atrophy; BBSI of 1.1, 1.3 and 1.0% and VBSI of 8.3, 7.2 and 10.9%, respectively. Rates of atrophy therefore differ according to the pathological diagnoses and underlying protein biochemistry. While rates are unlikely to be useful in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from cases with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB pathology, they demonstrate important pathophysiological differences between DLB and those with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and between those with CBD and PSP pathology.",[],Brain : a journal of neurology,2007-03-10,"[{'lastname': 'Whitwell', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jack', 'firstname': 'Clifford R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Parisi', 'firstname': 'Joseph E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Knopman', 'firstname': 'David S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Boeve', 'firstname': 'Bradley F', 'initials': 'BF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petersen', 'firstname': 'Ronald C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferman', 'firstname': 'Tanis J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dickson', 'firstname': 'Dennis W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Josephs', 'firstname': 'Keith A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1093/brain/awm021,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbcf9590>,,,,,,
258,17261788,Association between the polymorphism of CCR5 and Alzheimer's disease: results of a study performed on male and female patients from Northern Italy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in Western society. The prevalence of AD is greater in women than in men, largely due to longevity and survival differences favoring women. However, some studies suggest that incidence rates may really be increased in women. One possible factor influencing AD incidence in women is the loss of ovarian estrogens production after menopause, which might be involved in AD pathogenesis. Estrogens seem to influence some neuronal functions. Many of these actions appear beneficial (i.e., neuroprotective action against a variety of insults, as oxidative stress, and reduction of beta-amyloid plaques formation). Furthermore, several studies have shown that proinflammatory genotypes seem to significantly contribute to AD risk. In the present study, we evaluated whether the anti-inflammatory allele of chemokine receptor CCR5 is a component of the genetic protective background versus AD neuronal degeneration. We genotyped for Delta32 (a 32-bp deletion of the CCR5 gene that causes a frameshift at amino acid 185) in 191 AD patients (133 women and 58 men; age range: 53-98 years; mean age: 74.88 +/- 8.44) and 182 controls (98 women and 84 men; age range: 65-93; mean age 73.21 +/- 8.24) from northern Italy. No different distribution of the CCRDelta32 deletion in the two cohorts was clearly evident. Statistical analysis by gender stratification, demonstrated no differences in genotype distribution and allelic frequency both in women and in men. Further, studies should focus on identification of proinflammatory genetic variants involved in AD pathogenesis in women.",[],Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2007-01-31,"[{'lastname': 'Balistreri', 'firstname': 'Carmela Rita', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': ""Gruppo di Studio sull'Immunosenescenza, Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Corso Tukory 211, 90134 Palermo, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Grimaldi', 'firstname': 'Maria Paola', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vasto', 'firstname': 'Sonya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Listi', 'firstname': 'Florinda', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chiappelli', 'firstname': 'Martina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Licastro', 'firstname': 'Federico', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lio', 'firstname': 'Domenico', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Caruso', 'firstname': 'Calogero', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Candore', 'firstname': 'Giuseppina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1196/annals.1386.012,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbca5180>,,,,,,
259,17208076,Antihypertensive medication adherence in the Department of Veterans Affairs.,"Adherence measures the extent to which patients take medications as prescribed by their health care provider. The control of hypertension is dependent on medication adherence and may vary on the basis of antihypertensive medication class and other factors.
The Department of Veterans Affairs' automated pharmacy database captures pharmacy medication use; International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnostic codes; and laboratory and patient demographic data on a monthly basis. Hypertensive patients who used thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel antagonists, and alpha-blockers from July 2002 to December 2003 were studied. The first date of prescription filling for each patient within the date range was the index date from which fill and refill dates were collected for up to 18 months to calculate medication possession ratios and days out of medication ratios. Patients were categorized as adherent if the medication possession ratio was 80% or greater. Logistic regression was used to study the association of medication class, age, gender, ethnicity, Veterans Affairs facility, and co-diagnosis with diabetes, schizophrenia/psychosis, depression, and dementia with medication adherence.
We studied 40,492 hypertensive patients taking at least one antihypertensive drug class. The average age per class ranged from 67.4 to 72.9 years; 96% were male; and 51% were white, 8% were African-American, 4% were Asian-American, and 3% were Hispanic. Unadjusted adherence rates based on the medication possession ratio ranged from 78.3% for thiazide diuretics to 83.6% for angiotensin receptor blockers (P<.001). The number of medications (either total or antihypertensive) and age were independent predictors of better adherence. Black ethnicity and depression were associated with worse adherence.

All patients were 65 years of age or older. Measured outcomes were death by any cause and death by cerebrovascular accident at the end of the study. After a median follow-up of one year, survival was not significantly different between patients treated and not treated with AAs (overall mortality rates: 0.52 vs. 0.55/1000 years/person, respectively; relative risk reduction 0.047, 95% confidence interval -0.251 to 0.286). Multivariate survival analysis showed that older age at entry, male gender, severe dementia and functional impairment were associated with a higher risk of death.

12948999",Impact of neuroprotection on incidence of Alzheimer's disease.,"Converging evidence suggests that high levels of education and intellectual activity increase the cognitive reserve and reduce the risk of dementia. However, little is known about the impact that different neuroprotective strategies may have on the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Using a simple mathematical regression model, it is shown here that age-specific counts of basic cognitive units (surrogate of neurons or synapses) in the normal population can be estimated from Alzheimer's incidence rates. Hence, the model can be used to test the effect of neuroprotection on Alzheimer's incidence. It was found that the number of basic cognitive units decreases with age, but levels off in older people. There were no gender differences after correcting for survival. The model shows that even modest neuroprotective effects on basic cognitive units can lead to dramatic reductions in the number of Alzheimer's cases. Most remarkably, a 5% increase in the cognitive reserve would prevent one third of Alzheimer's cases. These results suggest that public health policies aimed at increasing the cognitive reserve in the general population (e.g., implementing higher levels of education) are likely the most effective strategy for preventing Alzheimer's disease.",[],PloS one,2006-12-22,"[{'lastname': 'de la Fuente-Fernández', 'firstname': 'Raúl', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Section of Neurology, Hospital A.

8778250",Risk factors for incident Alzheimer's disease in African Americans and Yoruba.,"The incidence rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was found to be 2 times lower in Yoruba than in African Americans. This study was aimed at identifying the factors associated with increased risk of incident AD in the two communities.
A two-stage design with initial screening using the CSI'D followed by neuropsychological test battery, relations' interview and physician assessment in a sub-sample.NINCDS-ADRDA criteria were met for AD. The risk factor variables assessed included demographic, lifestyle, medical and family history items.
In the Yoruba, AD was associated with age (OR = 1.07) and female gender (OR = 2.93). In African Americans, age (OR = 1.09) and rural living (OR = 2.08) were the significant risk factors, while alcohol was protective (OR = 0.49).
Age was a significant risk factor for AD at both sites.

263,16847520,[Alzheimer's disease as viewed by relatives of patients at public and private clinics].,"There are several ethical aspects related to the medical assistance of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) including diagnostic disclosure to the patient, performance of autopsy for diagnostic confirmation, and also topics pertaining to the caregivers constantly subjected by these patients to physical and mental stress. This work investigates some of these issues, by comparing family caregivers of patients with AD followed-up at both public and private health services.
Twenty family caregivers of AD patients followed up at a public university hospital and 20 family caregivers of AD patients followed up at a private clinic were interviewed using a specific questionnaire comprised of 36 questions about diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the disease.
The two groups presented similar age and gender distributions while the socioeconomic level was higher for the private clinic group. No differences were found between opinions of both groups regarding diagnostic disclosure to the patients, with 42.5% of the total in favor of disclosing the information only to the family. The number of caregivers who agreed with performance of autopsy was significantly higher in the public service (35% against 30% in the private clinic). Twenty caregivers (50% of the total sample) spontaneously manifested the wish to allow an autopsy for research purposes.

264,16472408,Attentional processes discriminate between patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and cognitively healthy elderly.,"It is generally accepted that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mainly characterized by memory disorders. Although recent studies also point to an important role of attention deficits early in the disease, this notion has not yet emerged in clinical practice. Our aim was to assess whether attention, quantified by reaction times, can discriminate between patients with mild AD and controls and therefore contribute to clinical diagnosis.
In a cross-sectional study, 33 patients with mild AD were matched with cognitively healthy elderly controls for age, gender, educational level and depressive mood. Selective attention (SA), alternating attention (AA) and error-rates were measured by a modified reaction time test.
Significant differences between both groups were found for all measures. Logistic regression showed that SA (corrected for individual processing speed) and error-rates could correctly classify subjects with an overall hit ratio of 81%. When attention measures were not corrected for individual processing speed, the overall hit ratio improved to 97%.

Retrospective cohort study.
Community (home residence) or long-term care facility.
A total of 1183 patients enrolled in the Rhode Island Medicaid program, aged 45 years or older, who were dispensed a cholinesterase inhibitor from January 1, 2000-June 30, 2002.
Patients were considered persistent with treatment if they filled at least five prescriptions for a 1-month supply of the same cholinesterase inhibitor, without an extended gap in days between refills. We compared rates of persistence among patients receiving and those not receiving drugs that can impair cognition. Covariates assessed were patient age, sex, race, and care setting. Approximately one in four patients discontinued cholinesterase inhibitor therapy within 6 months. Patients aged 85 years or older were more persistent than younger patients (77% vs 71%, p<0.05). Caucasian patients were more likely to be persistent than non-Caucasian patients (74% vs 52%, p<0.001). Patients living in the community were less likely to persist than those residing in long-term care facilities (58% vs 76%, p<0.001). After adjusting for race and care setting, patients who were prescribed drugs that can impair cognition were more likely not to have persisted with cholinesterase inhibitor therapy at 6 months than those who did not receive such drugs (odds ratio 1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.16).
A substantial percentage of patients who began receiving cholinesterase inhibitor therapy had discontinued the therapy within 6 months. Many patients also received prescriptions for agents that can impair cognition.

Female caregivers and those caring for people with neuropsychiatric symptoms are particularly at risk. The authors report on the prevalence of anxiety and depression in a sample of family caregivers of people with Alzheimer disease (AD) and compare the characteristics of those who did or did not have those conditions.
A group of 153 people with AD and their caregivers were interviewed as part of a larger study of AD.
In all, 23.5% of caregivers scored at or above caseness level for anxiety, and 10.5%, at levels for depression. Care-recipient (CR) activities of daily living (ADL) impairment, being a caregiver living with the CR, being a female caregiver, reporting a poorer quality of relationship with the CR, and caregivers reporting their health as being poor all predicted anxiety disorder. CR irritability, caregivers reporting poor health, and a poorer quality of relationship with the CR predicted depression.
Clinicians should be aware of the high rates of anxiety as well as depressive symptoms in family caregivers of people with AD, especially in female caregivers.

In 1997, the study was extended to Australia, Austria, Canada, Spain, and Switzerland.
Data were pooled from all participating countries for the years 1993 to 2002 and included deaths from definite or probable CJD of all etiologic subtypes.
Four thousand four hundred forty-one cases were available for analysis and included 3,720 cases of sporadic CJD, 455 genetic cases, 138 iatrogenic cases, and 128 variant cases. The overall annual mortality rate between 1999 and 2002 was 1.67 per million for all cases and 1.39 per million for sporadic CJD. Mortality rates were similar in all countries. There was heterogeneity in the distribution of cases by etiologic subtype with an excess of genetic cases in Italy and Slovakia, of iatrogenic cases in France and the UK, and of variant CJD in the UK.
This study has established overall epidemiologic characteristics for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of all types in a multinational population-based study. Intercountry comparisons did not suggest any relative change in the characteristics of sporadic CJD in the United Kingdom, and the evidence in this study does not suggest the occurrence of a novel form of human bovine spongiform encephalopathy infection other than variant CJD.

268,25782068,Gender differences in upper extremity motor performance of older persons.,"Motor performance declines with age. Although gender differences in motor strength and speed have been widely reported, the extent to which these differences are maintained in old age has not been well established.
Upper extremity motor performance was assessed in 234 men and 530 women Catholic clergy members aged 65 years or older with no clinical evidence of dementia who were participants in the Religious Orders Study. As part of a uniform clinical evaluation, upper extremity motor performance including strength (grip and pinch dynamometry), movement speed including finger tapping and Purdue pegboard and muscle bulk of the arm were collected.
Men were stronger than women at all ages but this difference became less prominent at older ages. Women scored higher on the Purdue Pegboard than men whereas men had faster maximal finger tapping rates than women. Gender differences in speed were not modified by age. Men had greater muscle bulk than women at all ages and these differences were not modified by age. These relationships were not modified by participants with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or stroke or by hormone replacement therapy in women.
Gender differences in upper extremity speed and muscle bulk appear to be relatively stable with increasing age, whereas gender differences in strength were reduced in the oldest old.

The subjects diagnosed with dementia underwent laboratory tests and brain computed tomography. A total of 1119 individuals were rescreened and 50 incident cases of dementia (28 with Alzheimer disease [AD]) were identified. The incidence rate of dementia was 13.8 and of AD was 7.7 per 1000 person-years for individuals aged 65 years or older. The incidence rates of dementia almost doubled with every 5 years of age. There was no difference according to gender, but women had a higher incidence of dementia, predominantly AD, in very old age.

Hippocampal atrophy is a characteristic feature of MCI and AD. This study analyzed cross-sectional data from 246 nondemented elderly subjects to test the effect of lipid lowering agent (LLA) therapy on cognition and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of white matter lesions and hippocampal volume. The study also compared rates of hippocampal volume change over two and four years in a smaller subset. At baseline, LLA users were younger, better educated, more likely to be male, and had higher cognitive scores. Cognitive performance also varied by age and gender, and MRI measures varied by age. After adjusting for these differences, the effect of LLA use on baseline cognition, baseline hippocampal volume, and baseline white matter lesion scores was not significant. The effect of LLA use on hippocampal volume loss at two-year and four-year follow-ups was also not significant. This study is the first to examine statin effects on brain atrophy measured by MRI. In this cohort, statin use was not associated with rate of change of hippocampal volume.

World Health Organization standardized mortality data for age and gender (1979/97) were used to examine changes in adult mortality rates per million based upon ICD-9 categories for ACDs, 'neurological deaths' and the special neurological categories of 'other neurological deaths' (ONDs) and 'mental disorder deaths' (MDDs), which include the dementias. Ratios of ratios were calculated to demonstrate how each individual country's pattern changed over the period by age and gender, resolving the problem of cross-national comparisons. Rates of change across the endpoints and between age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and 75+ years) were examined using analysis of variance, stepwise regression analysis and cross-tabulation analyses.
Meningitis deaths fell substantially, but there was little change in multiple sclerosis or epilepsy deaths. OND rates for the 1990s increased compared with the 1970s rates for males and female, in actual terms and relative to ACDs for almost all countries. Many of the relative rates of increase were substantially higher than 20%. There were significant statistical differences with respect to relative rates of ONDs between the 1970s and the 1990s data, even when the 75+ years age group was excluded. Significant differences were also found between age groups, but only in the 1990s data. MDD rates showed similar trends. Analyses of actual rates of increase in these causes of death showed that males outnumber females in all ages below 74 years. The extent of this difference remained constant across the endpoints. However, in those aged 75 years and over, females outnumbered males at both endpoints, but this disparity widened significantly in the 1990s data.
The 1990s data indicate substantial increases compared with the 1970s data for ONDs (especially amongst 65-74 year olds), and rises in MDDs in 55-64 year olds in five countries, including England and Wales and Germany, and in 65-74 year olds in most countries, suggesting earlier onsets of the underlying conditions.

275,14761625,[The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment among residents aged 55 or over in Chengdu area].,"To study the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the urban and the rural areas in Chengdu, Southwest China.
Residents aged 55 or over were selected by stratified random cluster sampling from 19 districts, cities, and counties of Chengdu area in Sichuan province. A two-stage survey was carried out. In the first stage, CMMSE, CES-D were used as screening instruments. In the second stage, Diagnostic questionnaires of dementia and CDR were used as diagnostic instruments. The diagnostic criteria of mild cognitive impairment adopted from Petersen's were: (1) memory complaint; (2) normal activities of daily living; (3) normal general cognitive function; (4) memory impairment incompatible with age; (5) not demented; (6) CDR = 0.5 and (7) exclusion of the reversible cognitive impairment caused by other factors (i.e. depression).
Three thousand, nine hundred and ten subjects were examined. The prevalence rates of MCI was 2.4%. The MCI prevalence rates in the urban and the rural areas were 1.5%, 2.5% respectively, without significant difference. The MCI prevalence in males and females were 1.8%, 2.9% respectively. Prevalence rate in female was higher than in males with significant difference. Prevalence of illiteracy (4.0%) was the highest among different educational levels. The accumulated prevalence increased with age.

276,14691421,Predictors of cardiologist care for older patients hospitalized for heart failure.,"Studies have suggested that cardiologists may provide higher quality heart failure care than generalists. However, national rates of specialty care during hospitalization for heart failure and factors associated with care by a cardiologist are unknown.
We assessed specialty care in a sample of Medicare patients hospitalized nationwide with heart failure between 1998 and 1999 (n = 25,869). Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify factors independently associated with treatment by a cardiologist.
One-quarter (25.5%) of patients had a cardiologist as their attending physician, 31.3% of patients received a cardiology consult, and 43.2% of patients were not treated by a cardiologist during hospitalization. Older patients (age <75 years: referent; age 75-84 years: risk ratio [RR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98; age > or =85 years: RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88) and women (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83-0.93) were less likely to have an attending cardiologist. Patients with a history of heart failure (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.20), coronary disease (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.14-1.32), coronary artery bypass grafting (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.32-1.42), or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.42) were more likely to be treated by a cardiologist, whereas patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.79) and dementia (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70) were less likely to be treated by a cardiologist. Patient race was not associated with treatment by a cardiologist. The strongest predictors of attending cardiology care were hospital factors, including large volume (>300 beds; RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.32-1.42) and geographic location (RR, 1.00 Northeast (referent) vs RR, 0.55; 95% CI 0.46-0.65 Midwest).

277,14568443,Changes in hippocampal volume and shape across time distinguish dementia of the Alzheimer type from healthy aging.,"Rates of hippocampal volume loss have been shown to distinguish subjects with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) from nondemented controls. In this study, we obtained magnetic resonance scans in 18 subjects with very mild DAT (CDR 0.5) and 26 age-matched nondemented controls (CDR 0) 2 years apart. Large-deformation high-dimensional brain mapping was used to quantify and compare changes in hippocampal shape as well as volume in the two groups of subjects. Hippocampal volume loss over time was significantly greater in the CDR 0.5 subjects (left = 8.3%, right = 10.2%) than in the CDR 0 subjects (left = 4.0%, right = 5.5%) (ANOVA, F = 7.81, P = 0.0078). We used singular-value decomposition and logistic regression models to quantify hippocampal shape change across time within individuals, and this shape change in the CDR 0.5 and CDR 0 subjects was found to be significantly different (Wilks's lambda, P = 0.014). Further, at baseline, CDR 0.5 subjects, in comparison to CDR 0 subjects, showed inward deformation over 38% of the hippocampal surface; after 2 years this difference grew to 47%. Also, within the CDR 0 subjects, shape change between baseline and follow-up was largely confined to the head of the hippocampus and subiculum, while in the CDR 0.5 subjects, shape change involved the lateral body of the hippocampus as well as the head region and subiculum. These results suggest that different patterns of hippocampal shape change in time as well as different rates of hippocampal volume loss distinguish very mild DAT from healthy aging.",[],NeuroImage,2003-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA. lei@conte.wustl.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Swank', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Glick', 'firstname': 'Irena E', 'initials': 'IE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gado', 'firstname': 'Mokhtar H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'Michael I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morris', 'firstname': 'John C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Csernansky', 'firstname': 'John G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00361-6,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbbe9810>,,,,,,

7595642",A position paper: based on observational data indicating an increased rate of altered blood chemistry requiring withdrawal from the Alzheimer's Disease Cholesterol-Lowering Treatment Trial (ADCLT).,"Recruitment for the inaugural double-blind placebo-controlled trial investigating a cholesterol-lowering treatment for benefit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (ADCLT) ended after obtaining 98 informed consents. Suspension of recruitment of the ADCLT occurred in concert with initiation of two separate multicenter trials testing similar hypotheses. Although occurring at very low rates (<2%), altered-chemistry adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy (withdrawal AEs) are not unexpected with use of cholesterol-lowering statins. We suggest that exceptionally close monitoring for altered chemistry among individuals with AD should be undertaken in future statin treatment trials, as limited data from the ADCLT indicate that chemically based withdrawal AEs could be more prevalent among female AD patients. There was no apparent correlation between the occurrence of withdrawal-AE incidence and lower body mass among the female AD trial subjects and, therefore, probably was not a dose-related resultant. This might indicate that cognitively intact elderly women at risk for heart disease and those with clinically documented AD should not be presumed to be pharmocodynamically equivalent. Lipid profiles obtained at screening in the ADCLT are consistent with a possible difference between patients with current AD and those at risk for heart disease. Elevated cholesterol, increased cholesterol/high-density lipid (HDL) ratios, and elevated triglycerides are routinely observed among those at risk for heart disease; however, among ADCLT study participants, only cholesterol levels were increased while cholesterol/HDL ratio and triglyceride levels remained within normal limits.",[],Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,2003-09-23,"[{'lastname': 'Sparks', 'firstname': 'D Larry', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Ralph and Murial Roberts Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ 95351, USA.

279,12812600,Barriers to vision care for nursing home residents.,"To describe the prevalence of periodic eye examinations by eye professionals and to examine nursing facility resident characteristics associated with lack of periodic screening.
Retrospective chart review.
Two Midwestern nursing facilities.
Between 1995 and 1997, 134 subjects aged 60 and older were recruited from two metropolitan nursing facilities.
Nursing home charts were reviewed for: demographics, length of stay, date of eye examination, eye diagnosis,visual acuity. Nursing assessments were used to obtain information about cognition, function, behavior, and the presence of Do Not Resuscitate or Do Not Hospitalize orders. The chart was reviewed for visual acuity, intraocular pressures, and the presence of eye pathology. Individuals who had not had eye examinations in the previous 2 years were screened by an ophthalmologist. This examination included external examination of the eye, fundoscopic examination, tonometry,visual acuity with correction.
Only 62 (46%) of the subjects had been seen by an eye care professional in the previous 2 years. Visual acuity information was available for 37/64 previously examined subjects. Of those with no eye examination in the previous 2 years (n = 72), visual acuity was obtained in 32 (44%) of subjects. New eye diagnoses were made in 64% (41/64). Logistic regression models with ""eye examination within the past 2 years"" as the dependent variable show that residents who do not desire hospital transfer are 80% less likely to have had an eye examination than those without this designation. Sex, age, length of stay, functional status, presence of severe dementia, behavior problems, or DNR orders do not change the likelihood that a resident would have been examined. Logistic regression models with ""visual acuity measured"" as the dependent variable show that residents with severe dementia are 12.6 times less likely to have acuity measured than those without dementia. Those with a length of stay in the facility less than 6 months are 10% less likely to have visual acuity measured.
This study does not confirm that barriers still exist in the provision of eye care to all nursing home residents, but the prevalence of such assessments remains low. Additional screening results in a substantial increase in the identification of treatable eye diseases. Contrary to the original hypotheses that patient characteristics that make testing difficult would provide a barrier or disincentive to vision testing, this study did not show statistical differences in the rates of vision screening for those with dementia, behavior problems, or severe functional impairment. Severe dementia does seem to affect the ability of the eye care specialist to gather subjective data such as visual acuity. It also demonstrates that vision screening does take place on nursing home residents with a broad range of cognitive and functional abilities, and this screening results in the diagnosis of many treatable eye conditions. Future efforts should be made to increase vision screening and treatment in the nursing home.",[],Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2003-06-19,"[{'lastname': 'Keller', 'firstname': 'B K', 'initials': 'BK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Geriatrics, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68918-5620, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hejkal', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Potter', 'firstname': 'J F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Only 62 (46%) of the subjects had been seen by an eye care professional in the previous 2 years.

281,12784031,Subjective memory complaints of family members of patients with Alzheimer's disease and depression.,"First-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depression (MD) carry an increased genetic risk for the same disorders. Subjective memory complaints of the family members of patients might be an early sign or an indicator of an increased risk of either dementia or depression. Alternatively, they might be the consequence of the increased subjective awareness of relatives and spouses of patients of their own age-associated memory failures. To investigate the relevance of the above-mentioned hypotheses, the prevalence rates of subjective memory complaints of first-degree relatives and spouses of patients with AD, of patients with MD and of control subjects were compared.
Personal interviews were conducted with 718 first-degree relatives and 196 spouses of 146 AD patients, 168 patients with MD and 136 control subjects from the general population. The prevalences of subjective memory complaints by relatives or spouses were compared using chi(2) tests. To control for differences of gender and age at onset, Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed.
There were no differences in the prevalence of subjective memory complaints by first-degree relatives of subjects with AD, MD and controls after controlling for age differences. The same applies to the subjective memory complaints in their spouses.
Subjective memory complaints were frequent in family members.

282,12509673,Racial differences in the diagnosis of dementia and in its effects on the use and costs of health care services.,"This study examined differences in the prevalence of dementia among Medicare beneficiaries by race and gender as well as racial differences in the effects of dementia on the use and costs of health care services.
Data from a 5 percent random sample of Medicare beneficiaries in the state of Tennessee who filed claims between 1991 and 1993 (N=33,680) were analyzed. Dementia was assessed on the basis of ICD-9 codes in the billing records of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), along with information on gender, race, comorbid psychiatric conditions, use of health services, and the actual amounts paid by HCFA. Patients with dementia related to Alzheimer's disease were excluded.
Diagnoses of dementia were significantly more prevalent among African-American beneficiaries than among white beneficiaries (5 percent compared with 3.9 percent). Persons with dementia had higher rates of health service use, particularly for inpatient care, and African-American persons with dementia had the highest levels of service use. Health care costs were also significantly higher for African Americans with a diagnosis of dementia.

Racial differences in the prevalence of dementia are clearly evident. Race also plays a role in the effects of dementia on the use and costs of health services, with higher rates of expensive inpatient care among African Americans.

283,12473010,"Nursing home facility risk factors for infection and hospitalization: importance of registered nurse turnover, administration, and social factors.","Determine the relationship between a broad array of structure and process elements of nursing home care and (a) resident infection and (b) hospitalization for infection.
Baseline data were collected from September 1992 through March 1995, and residents were followed for 2 years; facility data were collected at the midpoint of follow-up.
A stratified random sample of 59 nursing homes across Maryland.
Two thousand fifteen new admissions aged 65 and older.
Facility-level data were collected from interviews with facility administrators, directors of nursing, and activity directors; record abstraction; and direct observation. Main outcome measures included infection (written diagnosis, a course of antibiotic therapy, or radiographic confirmation of pneumonia) and hospitalization for infection (indicated on medical records).
The 2-year rate of infection was 1.20 episodes per 100 resident days, and the hospitalization rate for infection was 0.17 admissions per 100 resident days. Except for registered nurse (RN) turnover, which related to both infection and hospitalization, different variables related to each outcome. High rates of incident infection were associated with more Medicare recipients, high levels of physical/occupational therapist staffing, high licensed practical nurse staffing, low nurses' aide staffing, high intensity of medical and therapeutic services, dementia training, staff privacy, and low levels of psychotropic medication use. High rates of hospitalization for infection were associated with for-profit ownership, chain affiliation, poor environmental quality, lack of resident privacy, lack of administrative emphasis on staff satisfaction, and low family/friend visitation rates. Adjustment for resident sex, age, race, education, marital status, number of morbid diagnoses, functional status, and Resource Utilization Group, Version III score did not alter the relationship between the structure and process of care and outcomes.
The association between RN turnover and both outcomes underscores the relationship between nursing leadership and quality of care in these settings. The relationship between hospitalization for infection and for-profit ownership and chain affiliation could reflect policies not to treat acute illnesses in house. The link between social factors of care (environmental quality, prioritizing staff satisfaction, resident privacy, and facility visitation) and hospitalization indicates that a nonmedical model of care may not jeopardize, and may in fact benefit, health-related outcomes. All of these facility characteristics may be modifiable, may affect healthcare costs, and may hold promise for other, less-medical, forms of residential long-term care.",[],Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2002-12-11,"[{'lastname': 'Zimmerman', 'firstname': 'Sheryl', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Cecil G.

The study samples were drawn from community-dwelling patients in a large Medicare managed care organization (MCO) operating in the Northeast region of the USA. Costs for three study groups were contrasted in the study: 240 cases with vascular dementia (VaD), 1,366 cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 19,300 controls without dementia. Costs were estimated from medical and pharmacy claims data. Estimated cost differences are controlled for age, gender, and comorbid conditions using regression analysis.
VaD patients accounted for 6% of all dementia patients identified in the health plan. VaD patients had substantially higher prevalence rates for 10 cardiovascular conditions compared with AD patients and controls. Annual costs for VaD patients were US$6,797 greater than AD patients.

288,11490544,Epidemiology of dementia.,"With an unprecedented demographic change in the world population, the prevention and effective treatment of age-dependent diseased has become a compelling need. Epidemiology contributes in this way by estimating the incidence and prevalence of specific categories of morbidity and by identifying the risk or protective factors of dementia.

289,11410097,Development and validation of a prognostic index for 1-year mortality in older adults after hospitalization.,"For many elderly patients, an acute medical illness requiring hospitalization is followed by a progressive decline, resulting in high rates of mortality in this population during the year following discharge. However, few prognostic indices have focused on predicting posthospital mortality in older adults.
To develop and validate a prognostic index for 1 year mortality of older adults after hospital discharge using information readily available at discharge.
Data analyses derived from 2 prospective studies with 1-year of follow-up, conducted in 1993 through 1997.
We developed the prognostic index in 1495 patients aged at least 70 years who were discharged from a general medical service at a tertiary care hospital (mean age, 81 years; 67% female) and validated it in 1427 patients discharged from a separate community teaching hospital (mean age, 79 years; 61% female).
Prediction of 1-year mortality using risk factors such as demographic characteristics, activities of daily living (ADL) dependency, comorbid conditions, length of hospital stay, and laboratory measurements.
In the derivation cohort, 6 independent risk factors for mortality were identified and weighted using logistic regression: male sex (1 point); number of dependent ADLs at discharge (1-4 ADLs, 2 points; all 5 ADLs, 5 points); congestive heart failure (2 points); cancer (solitary, 3 points; metastatic, 8 points); creatinine level higher than 3.0 mg/dL (265 micromol/L) (2 points); and low albumin level (3.0-3.4 g/dL, 1 point; <3.0 g/dL, 2 points). Several variables associated with 1-year mortality in bivariable analyses, such as age and dementia, were not independently associated with mortality after adjustment for functional status. We calculated risk scores for patients by adding the points of each independent risk factor present. In the derivation cohort, 1-year mortality was 13% in the lowest-risk group (0-1 point), 20% in the group with 2 or 3 points, 37% in the group with 4 to 6 points, and 68% in the highest-risk group (>6 points). In the validation cohort, 1-year mortality was 4% in the lowest-risk group, 19% in the group with 2 or 3 points, 34% in the group with 4 to 6 points, and 64% in the highest-risk group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the point system was 0.75 in the derivation cohort and 0.79 in the validation cohort.
Our prognostic index, which used 6 risk factors known at discharge and a simple additive point system to stratify medical patients 70 years or older according to 1-year mortality after hospitalization, had good discrimination and calibration and generalized well in an independent sample of patients at a different site.

In Ibadan, Alzheimer's disease accounted for 64.3% of the cases, with old age and female gender being the significant risk factors, whilst 'living with others' appeared to be protective (P < 0.05). Amongst African Americans, on the other hand, old age, rural living below the age of 19 years, low educational attainment and family history of dementia were the risk factors.

The number of MDS cases diagnosed over the last 20 years has risen substantially due to increased awareness and improved geriatric care. Although MDS is increasingly diagnosed, the prevalence and prognosis of early-stage affected elderly are not completely known.
To evaluate the prevalence, characteristics and prognosis of newly diagnosed MDS patients hospitalized in an acute and subacute geriatric department.
Between 1993 and 1996, 3,275 patients hospitalized in the geriatric department of a teaching hospital for acute care or short-term rehabilitation were investigated for unexplained hematological abnormalities. Demographic, chronic comorbidities, cause of hospitalization, functional and cognitive status, hematological and other laboratory parameters were collected.
Two hundred and forty-five (7.5%) patients had unexplained cytopenia, macrocytosis or monocytosis, of whom 37 (15%) were diagnosed as having MDS. Only 9 patients were hospitalized for evaluation of anemia, 28 for infections, cardiac, cerebrovascular events and other causes. Thirty-four patients had refractory anemia (RA), two had RA with ringed sideroblasts and 1 had RA with an excess of blasts (RAEB). The follow-up period was up to 70 months. No differences were found between demented and cognitively normal patients in age, sex, comorbidities or laboratory parameters. Comparison of survival curves (excluding the RAEB case) according to demographic, clinical and hematological parameters has shown that only dementia adversely affects survival, compared to cognitively normal patients (p = 0.024).

In a cross-sectional population-based study in Berlin (West), Germany, 516 people aged 70 to 95+ were randomly selected from the obligatory city registry (1990-1993) and stratified by age and gender (N = 43 men and N = 43 women in each of six 5-year age groups). Psychiatric and physical examinations were carried out in an extensive standardized assessment. Distinct psychopathological syndromes occurred in 72.7% of the elderly (54.6% of the men, 79.1% of the women). A clinically defined psychiatric disorder was found in 49.4% of the elderly (95% confidence interval 43.9%- 54.9%; 36.4% of the men, 54.0% of the women). Excluding insomnia, the overall psychiatric morbidity was 40.4% (30.9% m, 43.8% w). Excluding clinical diagnoses that were not otherwise specified in the DSM-III-R, the overall prevalence of specified DSM-III-R diagnoses was 23.5% (16.3% m, 26.0% w).

36% of men and 33% of women exhibited behavioral problems. Wandering, verbal and physical abusiveness, and inappropriate behavior tended to be more common in men, especially among PD residents with severe cognitive impairment. Hallucinations and delusions were equally prevalent between genders and depressive symptoms were more common in women. Regardless of behavioral manifestation, men were more likely to receive antipsychotic drugs, whereas women were more likely to receive antidepressants.

Recent epidemiological studies reveal higher rates of women affected by the two major dementing conditions, AD and vascular dementia (VaD). However, it is under debate whether a pure gender effect accounts for this, because gender differences e.g. in education, life expectancy, psychosocial development and health behaviour must be included in the analysis. Therefore it seems to be reasonable to have a look on gender related variances in other risk and protective factors of dementia. Recently, the menopause attracted the interest of dementia researchers, because retrospective studies revealed a favourable effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the incidence of AD by about 50%. However, in spite of well known ""positive effects"" of estrogens on the central nervous system, there is still not enough evidence for a recommendation of HRT for the prevention of AD and other dementias.",[],Zeitschrift fur arztliche Fortbildung und Qualitatssicherung,2000-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Stoppe', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Psychiatrische Klinik und Poliklinik, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. gstoppe@gwdg.de'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbb82270>,,,,,,

298,10599770,Gender differences in the incidence of AD and vascular dementia: The EURODEM Studies. EURODEM Incidence Research Group.,"To study the difference in risk for dementing diseases between men and women.
Previous studies suggest women have a higher risk for dementia than men. However, these studies include small sample sizes, particularly in the older age groups, when the incidence of dementia is highest.
Pooled analysis of four population-based prospective cohort studies was performed. The sample included persons 65 years and older, 528 incident cases of dementia, and 28,768 person-years of follow-up. Incident cases were identified in a two-stage procedure in which the total cohort was screened for cognitive impairment, and screen positives underwent detailed diagnostic assessment. Dementia and main subtypes of AD and vascular dementia were diagnosed according to internationally accepted guidelines. Sex- and age-specific incidence rates, and relative and cumulative risks for total dementia, AD, and vascular dementia were calculated using log linear analysis and Poisson regression.
There were significant gender differences in the incidence of AD after age 85 years. At 90 years of age, the rate was 81.7 (95% CI, 63.8 to 104.7) in women and 24.0 (95% CI, 10.3 to 55.6) in men. There were no gender differences in rates or risk for vascular dementia. The cumulative risk for 65-year-old women to develop AD at the age of 95 years was 0.22 compared with 0.09 for men. The cumulative risk for developing vascular dementia at the age of 95 years was similar for men and women (0.04).

We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in 186 patients with possible or probable AD, mostly with presenile onset. In a cross-sectional analysis at entry, impairment of glucose metabolism in temporoparietal or frontal association areas measured with positron emission tomography was significantly associated with dementia severity, clinical classification as possible versus probable AD, presence of multiple cognitive deficits and history of progression. A prospective longitudinal analysis showed a significant association between initial metabolic impairment and subsequent clinical deterioration. In patients with mild cognitive deficits at entry, the risk of deterioration was up to 4.7 times higher if the metabolism was severely impaired than with mild or absent metabolic impairment.

301,10461029,Insulin metabolism in Alzheimer's disease differs according to apolipoprotein E genotype and gender.,"Higher fasting plasma insulin levels and reduced CSF-to-plasma insulin ratios, suggestive of insulin resistance, have been observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who do not possess an apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 allele. We examined the relationship of APOE and gender to peripheral insulin action and hyperinsulinemic memory facilitation in patients with AD using a sensitive measure of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Participants were 32 patients with AD (9 without an epsilon4 allele, 23 with an epsilon4 allele) and 25 healthy age-matched adults (16 without an epsilon4 allele, 9 with an epsilon4 allele). AD subjects without an epsilon4 allele had significantly lower insulin-mediated glucose disposal rates than AD patients with an epsilon4 allele (p < 0.03), or than normal adults without an epsilon4 allele (p < 0.02). Female AD subjects showed lower insulin-mediated glucose disposal rates than did male AD subjects (p < 0.02). No significant interaction was observed between APOE group and gender, suggesting that these effects are independent. AD subjects without an epsilon4 allele also showed significant memory facilitation in the hyperinsulinemic condition (p < 0.04), whereas the AD-epsilon4 group did not. Also in the hyperinsulinemic condition, AD patients without an epsilon4 allele had lower insulin levels than patients with an epsilon4 allele (p < 0.02), and women with AD had lower insulin levels than did men with AD despite similar insulin infusion rates and body mass (p < 0.004). No gender or genotype effects were observed in either condition for normal subjects. These results provide in vivo evidence of differences in insulin-mediated energy metabolism between epsilon4 and non-epsilon4 AD, and suggest that defective insulin action may be of particular pathophysiologic significance for patients without an epsilon-4 allele.",[],Neuroendocrinology,1999-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Craft', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Veteran Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Wash., USA.scraft@u.washington.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Asthana', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schellenberg', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cherrier', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Baker', 'firstname': 'L D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Newcomer', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Plymate', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Latendresse', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petrova', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Raskind', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Peskind', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lofgreen', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grimwood', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1159/000054469,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbb34d10>,,,,,,
302,10389597,Neuropsychological assessment of older adults with Down's syndrome: an epidemiological study using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG).,"The Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) was designed for the general elderly population to assess cognitive impairments characteristic of dementia. CAMCOG yields a total score as well as separate scores on seven subscales. In this study the suitability of the CAMCOG for older adults with Down's Syndrome (DS) at the age of risk for dementia was assessed.
A near total population sample of people with DS aged 30 years and over (range 30-65 years) living in a single Health Authority catchment area was identified and assessed using the CAMCOG. The use of an unselected sample ensured that the value of this assessment instrument could be established across all levels of disability in those with DS. A lower age limit of 30 years was used, as from this age significant Alzheimer-like neuropathology is present and prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease begin to increase.
The CAMCOG was administered in a familiar setting together with other neuropsychological tests. Gender and age differences and the characteristics of those at the floor of the test were investigated.
Of the 77 people with DS aged 30 years or older, 74 agreed to take part. Scores on the CAMCOG were well distributed, with only eight participants (11%) scoring 0 on the test. This contrasted favourably with performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination where there was a narrower range of scores and a higher percentage scoring 0. There was a significant difference in cognitive performance between younger (30-44 years) and older (45+ years) participants on the total CAMCOG score and on six out of the seven CAMCOG subscales.

Kaplan-Meier curves for the combined score of these items (0, 1, or 2) showed three groups with significantly different survival rates for both men and women. Comparison of gender specific survival rates with data from the general population showed that excess mortality was statistically significant (P < 0.01) higher in men (51%) than in women (21%) after follow-up extending to 5 years.

304,10203126,Alzheimer's disease symptom severity in blacks and whites.,"In order to determine whether there are racial differences in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) symptom severity and vascular comorbidities, we compared African-American (black) and Caucasian (white) patients with AD from similar socioeconomic backgrounds at the time the disease was first recognized.
Cross-sectional observational study from a population-based dementia registry.
Patients were enrolled from an HMO base population of 23,000 persons more than age 60 in Seattle, Washington. This study examines 453 subjects with probable AD (38 blacks (mean age 76.5, SD 6.4), and 415 whites (mean age 79.7, SD 6.7)).
Measured were patient demographics, age at onset of AD, AD symptom duration, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score, Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, presence of psychiatric symptoms, and vascular comorbidities.
Blacks had significantly lower mean cognitive scores (MMSE = 17.2, SD 5.6) compared with whites (MMSE = 20.2, SD 5.2, unpaired t test P < .01). The significant racial difference in MMSE scores persisted after controlling for education, duration of AD symptoms, age, and ADL impairment. Blacks and whites did not differ significantly regarding gender distribution, education level, income, or percent with early age of onset of AD. No statistically significant race-related differences were found in impairments in activities of daily living or symptoms of paranoia, hallucinations, or agitation. Blacks had significantly higher rates of hypertension (56%) compared with whites (34%) (Fisher's exact test, P = .013), but the rates of stroke and ischemic heart disease were similar.
Despite uniform detection methods and controlling for reported duration of dementia symptoms, measured cognitive impairment is significantly more severe when AD is recognized in blacks compared with whites. The significantly higher prevalence of hypertension among black AD cases was not associated with excess cerebrovascular disease comorbidity. This study highlights a need for normative measurements of cognitive function in minority AD groups in order to distinguish differential cognitive symptom severity from possible measurement bias.",[],Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1999-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Shadlen', 'firstname': 'M F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Larson', 'firstname': 'E B', 'initials': 'EB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gibbons', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McCormick', 'firstname': 'W C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Teri', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Blacks had significantly lower mean cognitive scores (MMSE = 17.2, SD 5.6) compared with whites (MMSE = 20.2, SD 5.2, unpaired t test P < .01).

305,9921852,Rates and risk factors for dementia and Alzheimer's disease: results from EURODEM pooled analyses. EURODEM Incidence Research Group and Work Groups. European Studies of Dementia.,"To investigate the risk of AD associated with a family history of dementia, female gender, low levels of education, smoking, and head trauma.
These putative factors have been identified in cross-sectional studies. However, those studies are prone to bias due to systematic differences between patients and control subjects regarding survival and how risk factors are recalled.
The authors performed a pooled analysis of four European population-based prospective studies of individuals 65 years and older, with 528 incident dementia patients and 28,768 person-years of follow-up. Patients were detected by screening the total cohort with brief cognitive tests, followed by a diagnostic assessment of those who failed the screening tests. Dementia was diagnosed with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed. (revised), and AD was diagnosed according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria. Incident rates and relative risk (95% CI) express the association of a risk factor for dementia.
Incident rates for dementia and AD were similar across studies. The incidence of AD increased with age. At 90 years of age and older the incidence was 63.5 (95% CI, 49.7 to 81.0) per 1,000 person-years. Female gender, current smoking (more strongly in men), and low levels of education (more strongly in women) increased the risk of AD significantly. A history of head trauma with unconsciousness and family history of dementia did not increase risk significantly.
Contrary to previous reports, head trauma was not a risk factor for AD, and smoking did not protect against AD. The association of family history with the risk of AD is weaker than previously estimated on the basis of cross-sectional studies. Female gender may modify the risk of AD, whether it be via biological or behavioral factors.",[],Neurology,1999-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Launer', 'firstname': 'L J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Erasmus University Medical School, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

306,9826968,Statistical and clinical evaluation of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-Spanish adaptation: an initial investigation.,"The usefulness of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) for Spanish dominant elderly adults has seen little empirical documentation, though there is considerable reason to hypothesize its value with this diverse and growing population. A Spanish adaptation of the MDRS (MDRS-SA) was developed for the present study in a manner to facilitate linguistic equivalence. Reliability for the MDRS-SA showed high split half internal consistency across all scales and Total Score. Two groups of elderly adults, one neurologically impaired and one not, both with low Mexican American acculturation level, Spanish dominance, and little formal education were participants. Results of a MANCOVA analysis, controlling for age, education, acculturation, and gender, showed the MDRS-SA to be effective at discriminating between groups across all scales (p < .001) and Total Score (p < .05). After determining significant differences between original norms and normative data on the present Spanish group, clinical utility of these statistical findings was investigated by generating specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy rates for the MDRS-SA Total Score, using Spanish normative data. Results of this preliminary study supported the MDRS-SA for use within the Mexican American, Spanish dominant elderly population, though additional larger validation studies are needed, particularly with well-documented clinical samples.",[],"The journals of gerontology.

308,9666062,"Initiation and propagation stages of beta-amyloid are associated with distinctive apolipoprotein E, age, and gender profiles.","Several recent studies have defined a relationship between apo-lipoprotein E (apoE) genotype and the risk of various neurodegenerative disorders. However, few studies have examined the influence of apoE on quantitative measures of beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in a large population of autopsy cases. Using a multi-level analysis model, the interrelationships among apoE genotype, gender, age, and Abeta accumulation were investigated. In the population of these cases, there was a strong relationship between the presence of an epsilon4 allele and extent of Abeta in the frontal and entorhinal cortex. That is, when evaluating the presence or absence of significant Abeta (>1% Abeta load), subjects with one and two epsilon4 alleles were 1.9 and 3.5 times more likely to have significant Abeta accumulation than those with no epsilon4 alleles. These risks increased by a multiplicative factor of 1.014 for each year of age (at the time of death). In the subset of cases with significant Abeta (>1% Abeta load), the degree of Abeta load was best predicted by the presence of an epsilon2 allele and gender; females with no epsilon2 alleles had the highest Abeta loads (mean=12.3%), while males with one epsilon2 allele had the lowest amount of Abeta accumulation (mean=8.6%). Our results suggest that the presence of an epsilon4 allele predicts an earlier onset of Abeta deposition that is independent of gender. In contrast, once Abeta deposition has been initiated, the presence of an epsilon2 allele is associated with slower rates of accumulation, with males benefiting from the protective effect more than females.",[],Brain research,1998-07-17,"[{'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'J K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-4285, USA. jjohnson@teri.bio.uci.edu'}, {'lastname': 'McCleary', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Oshita', 'firstname': 'M H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cotman', 'firstname': 'C W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

As part of a community prevalence study of dementia, information on alcohol consumption and cognitive performance was collected on 2040 randomly selected black subjects living in Indianapolis.
From questions in the screening interview, alcohol consumption was grouped into four categories: lifetime abstainers, regular drinkers less than 4 drinks per week, 4 to 10 drinks per week, and more than 10 drinks per week. Current and past drinkers were analyzed separately. Three measurements were used: (1) a total cognitive score; (2) the delayed recall score from the East Boston Memory Test; (3) a score for daily functioning based upon information from the informant. Multiple regression models were fitted with drinking variables as the major predictor, including covariates of age, gender, education, history of stroke, hypertension, being treated for depression, and a family history of dementia.
In all analyses, there was a very consistent pattern for both current and past drinkers. There was a small but significant dose effect of drinking for the drinkers, with subjects in the heaviest drinking category scoring poorest, i.e., lowest scores in cognitive tests and highest scores in scales of daily functioning indicating more impairment. The scores of abstainers were worse than those of subjects in the lightest drinking category. The pattern of scores for cognitive performance and daily functioning was similar between current and past drinkers. These patterns remained the same even after potential confounders were included.
Previous research on effects of alcohol on health indices have suggested a J-shaped relationship between amounts of alcohol consumption and measurements of heart disease, stroke, and mortality rates. Our study provides some support for the concept of a similar J-shaped relationship between cognitive performance and alcohol consumption, but the differences between drinking categories were modest and the clinical significance of these findings uncertain.",[],Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1996-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hendrie', 'firstname': 'H C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5111, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hall', 'firstname': 'K S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hui', 'firstname': 'S L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Unverzagt', 'firstname': 'F W', 'initials': 'FW', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1532-5415.1996.tb01364.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbb1ebd0>,,,,,,

A prospective, longitudinal study of 10 years duration with ECGs obtained at baseline and on an annual basis.
A community-based cohort study consisting of 459 subjects (aged 75-85, mean age 79 years).
Baseline and follow up ECGs were interpreted using the Minnesota Code. Prevalence and incidence of LVH and ECG were determined as well as regression of ECG LVH. Clinical event rates measured were incidence of total mortality, myocardial infarction (MI, fatal and non-fatal), cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular disease (fatal and non-fatal), stroke (fatal and non-fatal), all-cause dementia, and multi-infarct dementia. Differences in event rates between groups (those subjects with and without LVH) were compared as tests between proportions. A Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis was performed to compare the relative independent predictive values of different competing factors, including age, gender, serum cholesterol, digitalis use, body mass, index, Blessed Dementia Scale, cigarette smoking, LVH at baseline, LVH ar baseline (persisting), new LVH, new LVH (persisting), new LVH (regressed), previous MI by history of ECG, hypertension by history, and cardiomegaly by X-ray (cardiothoracic ratio > or = 50%).
At baseline, 9.2% of subjects (n = 42) had LVH on ECG and a mortality rate of 11.7/100 persons years versus 4.9/100 persons years for subjects without baseline LVH (P < .0001), and MI rate of 7.5/100 persons years with LVH versus 2.6/100 persons years without LVH (P < .0001), and a cardiovascular mortality rate of 7.2/100 persons years without LVH versus 2.7/100 person years without LVH. Subjects who developed new LVH on ECG (n = 39) had a mortality rate of 14.4/100 person-years compared with 4.4/100 person-years for those without LVH (P < .0001), a cardiovascular mortality rate of 11.1/100 person years versus 2.0/100 person years without LVH (P < .0001), and an MI rate of 6.1/100 person years versus 2.0/100 person years without LVH (P < .01). Subjects in whom the ECG LVH pattern disappeared over time had fewer cardiovascular mortal and morbid events than those with persistent LVH. According to the regression analyses, persistent LVH from baseline was an independent predictor of MI, overall cardiovascular disease, and total mortality. Newly developing LVH with subsequent regression was an independent predictor of overall cardiovascular disease and death.
An increased prevalence and incidence of LVH on ECG, irrespective cause, is associated with a poor prognosis in very old men and women.

This observational study of a nationally representative sample of 14,008 Medicare patients hospitalized with congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, or hip fracture evaluated the relationship of DNR orders to patient sickness at admission, functional impairment, age, disease, race, gender, preadmission residence, insurance status, and hospital characteristics.
Of the 14,008 patients, DNR orders were assigned to 11.6%. Patients with greater sickness at admission and functional impairment received more DNR orders (P < .001) but even among patients in the sickest quartile (with a 65% chance of death within 180 days), only 31% received DNR orders. The DNR orders were assigned more often to older patients after adjustment for sickness at admission and functional impairment (P < .001), and DNR order rates differed by diagnosis (P < .001). After adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, DNR orders were assigned more often to women and patients with dementia or incontinence and were assigned less often to black patients, patients with Medicaid insurance, and patients in rural hospitals.
Do-not-resuscitate orders are assigned more often to sicker patients but may be underused even among the most sick. Sickness at admission and functional impairment do not explain the increase in DNR orders with age or the disparity across diagnosis. Further evaluation is needed into whether variation in DNR order rates with age, diagnosis, race, gender, insurance status, and rural location represents differences in patient preferences or care compromising patient autonomy.","['Death and Euthanasia', 'Empirical Approach', 'Medicaid']",Archives of internal medicine,1995-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Wenger', 'firstname': 'N S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, UCLA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pearson', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Desmond', 'firstname': 'K A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Harrison', 'firstname': 'E R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rubenstein', 'firstname': 'L V', 'initials': 'LV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rogers', 'firstname': 'W H', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kahn', 'firstname': 'K L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Of the 14,008 patients, DNR orders were assigned to 11.6%.

The 37 subjects (18 men, 19 women) who completed less than four data collection sessions compared with the 23 subjects (11 men, 12 women) who completed all four sessions differed on education and Reporter's Test scores. Longitudinal analysis of measures showed that gender differences persisted for the BNT and PPVT-R and that time differences were found on all measures. Gender differences remained after correcting for age, education, duration of illness, and mental status. We found no differences for the NE comparison group for gender or time.

Community survey with cluster sampling.
One urban and one rural community from each of four geographic regions in Taiwan, Republic of China.
A total of 5265 nondemented individuals approximately equally divided between men and women and between urban and rural residency with a range in age from 41 to 88 years and in education from 0 to 20 years.
Score on a Chinese adaptation of the Mini-Mental State Examination.
Lower test scores were associated with older age and less education. The decrease in score with age was faster among participants who had never attended school. Better performance by men and by urban residents was found only among participants with fewer than 6 years of schooling. In this group, the magnitudes of sex and residency differences were comparable among those subjects aged 41 to 64 years and those aged 65 to 88 years. Women who had never worked outside of the home performed poorer than those who had worked outside of the home.
The influence of educational background on test performance is most evident in individuals with less education.

318,8084935,"Phenomenology, demography and diagnosis in late paraphrenia.","One hundred and one patients with late paraphrenia were examined using the Present State Examination. The established high prevalence rates of female gender, the unmarried state and sensory impairment were confirmed. All of the symptoms of schizophrenia, with the exception of formal thought disorder, were found in the subjects with approximately the same prevalence as reported in schizophrenics with a symptom onset in younger life. The presence of visual hallucinosis was significantly associated with visual impairment, but the same association was not found between auditory hallucinations and deafness. Mean age at onset of symptoms was high at 74.1 years. Using ICD-10 diagnostic criteria the patients were categorized as schizophrenia (61.4%), delusional disorder (30.7%) and schizoaffective disorder (7.9%). Patients in these diagnostic categories differed in their pre-morbid IQ estimations, current cognitive state measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and in the number of scored positive psychotic PSE symptoms and their systematization of and preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations. There were no significant differences between the patients in the ICD-10 schizophrenia and delusional disorder groups in terms of age at symptom onset, sex ratio, response to treatment, being unmarried, the presence of insight or sensory impairment. The high degree of clinical similarity between patients with late paraphrenia combined with the inability of ICD-10 to define diagnostic subgroups that correspond to patient clusters derived from clinical symptoms or which are meaningfully different from each other in terms of demographic and prognostic factors provide a strong argument for the retention of late paraphrenia as the most appropriate diagnosis for such patients.",[],Psychological medicine,1994-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Howard', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Section of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, London.'}, {'lastname': 'Almeida', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Levy', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1017/s0033291700027379,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbacb630>,,,,,,

Prospective cohort study.
Eight proprietary NHs in Maryland.
Four hundred thirty new admissions age 65 or older who were participants in a larger prospective study of mental morbidity and adjustment to the NH.
Nurses aides' reports of continence status, psychiatric examinations, and nursing staff assessments of mobility at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 1 year after NH admission.
The prevalence of daytime UI at admission was 39% in both females and males. Among the 293 members (68%) of the admission cohort remaining in the NHs 2 months after admission, the incidence of daytime UI was 27% (21% in females, 51% in males); daytime UI resolved in 23% (24% in females, 20% in males). Among the 178 members (41%) of the admission cohort remaining in the NHs 1 year after admission, the incidence of daytime UI between 2 months and 1 year after admission was 19% (16% in females, 46% in males); daytime UI resolved in 22% (23% in females, 14% in males). The continence status of about two-thirds of residents remaining in the NH at 1 year after admission was stable over time: 22% had daytime UI, and 42% were continent at all three data collection points. The development of daytime UI was associated with male sex, the diagnosis of dementia, fecal incontinence, and the inability to ambulate or transfer independently. Resolution of daytime UI was associated with the absence of these characteristics.
Despite limitations attributable to the method of defining UI and potential biases related to the attrition of the admission cohort over time, this is the first large prospective study to examine the incidence and remission patterns of daytime UI among NH residents. The strong association between UI and dementia was validated for the first time by direct psychiatric examinations.

320,1379339,Gender differences and the interpretation of genetic instability in Alzheimer's disease.,"The neuronal degeneration and death which characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) may stem from a constitutive genetic instability related to DNA repair deficits. To test this hypothesis, we treated peripheral blood lymphocytes from persons with AD, age-matched controls, and young controls with two drugs that induce chromosome breakage. Bleomycin, a radiomimetic antineoplastic drug, causes single- and double-stranded DNA breaks through the generation of activated oxygen radicals. Methyl methane-sulfonate (MMS) is a monofunctional alkylating agent that binds covalently to DNA. Cells were grown in culture for 72 h, with drug treatments for 4 h (bleomycin) or 24 h (MMS) prior to harvest. Fifty cells per subject per drug were scored for chromosome breakage. Breakage rates for both drugs in AD women were significantly higher than those in age-matched control women. This was not the case in men, due to the very high induced breakage rates seen in the age-matched normal control men. Because the induced breakage rates in AD women and AD men are equivalent, it seems likely that an independent factor may be contributing to genetic instability in the normal control men. Our findings indicate that the interpretation of the response of AD lymphocyte chromosomes to DNA-damaging chemicals can be strongly confounded by the effects of gender ratio in the control population sampled. These findings have important implications for the design of future studies of Alzheimer's disease, as well as for the assessment of health risks in unaffected elderly populations.",[],Mutation research,1992-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cherry', 'firstname': 'L M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas Mental Sciences Institute, Houston 77030.'}, {'lastname': 'Funk', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lesser', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lesam', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0921-8734(92)90009-e,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbadae50>,,,,,,

3945391",Dementia in Newfoundland: identification of a geographical isolate?,"The aims were (1) to identify from death certificates regions with an increased incidence of dementia mortality; and (2) to determine whether a previously observed excess of patients with Alzheimer disease originating from a small area could be confirmed in a survey of death certificates.
The study identified all individuals dying with dementia, recorded on death certificates as an immediate, antecedent, underlying, or contributing cause of death. Rather than the usual residence, the birthplace of these individuals was used to determine regional differences in dementia mortality. A comparison was made of two areas to test the significance of a geographical isolate of persons. To test for a possible genetic component of the excess, an analysis was made of the frequencies of family names. To test for a possible environmental component an analysis was made of standard measurements of drinking water quality.
The survey data were derived from all 1985 and 1986 deaths in the province of Newfoundland.
Based on the current census population, the prevalence of dementia at death for 1985 and 1986 was 34 and 37/100,000. For both years there was a significant excess of persons originating from a small area (95% CI, 1.1-20.7%, and 2.5-20.4%). This excess could not be explained by differences in age, sex, ethnic origin, or by variation in mobility patterns. The study area has a high concentration of aluminium in the drinking water. An analysis of the family names gave inconclusive evidence of a clustering among the dementia cases.
If all contributing causes of death are recorded and the birthplace of individuals is noted, mortality statistics can reveal regional differences in dementia rates. This shows the need to examine areas smaller than census districts to identify subpopulation variation in the prevalence of dementia. Environmental influences can vary substantially in areas relatively close together, as evidenced in measurements of drinking water chemistry. Genetic influences are more likely to be revealed from the birthplace of individuals, which may indicate a common ancestry.",[],Journal of epidemiology and community health,1991-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Frecker', 'firstname': 'M F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University, St John's, Newfoundland, Canada.""}]",,,,,10.1136/jech.45.4.307,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dba63b30>,,,,,,

The 20 linked markers form a continuous linkage group of 152 cM in males and 202 cM in females. Likely genetic locations are provided for 25 polymorphic anonymous sequences and 28 gene-specific RFLPs. The map was constructed employing the LINKAGE and CRIMAP computational methodologies to build the multipoint map via a stepwise algorithm.

Edward's test for peak quarter was significant for AD females, however, with the peak period occurring early in the first quarter.

324,1791301,A morphogenetic quantitative approach to species-typical behaviour.,"The numerical ratio of the allocortical, late-myelinized infra-temporal sector (Flechsig) to the neocortical convexity of the temporal lobe in the human brain is proposed as a quantitative invariant of the human species, called ""Neocorticalisation Index NI"". Its morphogenetic nature derives from (1) the dual, that is the reptilian-palaeomammalian origin of the primate cortex (Kappers 1909, Vogt 1910. Kuhlenbeck 1924, Filimonoff 1947, Northcutt 1967, Stephan 1975). The two layers differentiate at independent rates forming a transitional belt, called ""periallocortex"" (limbic) and ""mesocortex"" (insular). They approach the most the general cyto- and myeloarchitectonic scheme of Brodmann (1909) and C. and O. Vogt (1919), and in the human brain are the latest to reach maturity (Flechsig 1920, Kahle 1969, Sanides 1975); (2) measurements in fossilized human brain endocasts (Taung, Rhodesian man) reported earlier (Irsigler 1984a and b); (3) clinico-pathological evidence gained from cases of the Pick-type of presenile dementia confirming the anthropogenetic character of the frontotemporal ""basal forebrain"" (Spatz and his school since 1937, Lüers 1947, Jakob 1979). The latter is considered to be in the mammals the major counterpart of the hormonally and reciprocally controlled reptilian forebrain (Schepers 1948, Sanides 1970, MacLean 1978). The results of NI measurements in 128 human brains are tabulated and interpreted in the light of species-typical behaviour. It turns out that the left hemisphere is the one possessing the greater share of allocorticity showing precocious development in the non-European (Negro) infant. There are gender-related differences of the NI parameters. The Indo-Europeans (Caucasians) undergo, in their ontogeny, a kind of ""secondary"" allocorticalisation in both hemispheres which, hypothetically, may be correlated with the ""substantializing"" (reifying) property inherent in their languages.",[],Journal fur Hirnforschung,1991-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Irsigler', 'firstname': 'F J', 'initials': 'FJ', 'affiliation': 'South African Association For the Advancement of Science.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dba8c4a0>,,,,,,

A total of 93 consultations were done on 67 AIDS patients and 138 consultations were done on 121 comparably aged patients without AIDS. The most common AIDS risk factor was intravenous drug use. The AIDS patients were more likely to be Hispanic and male than were the non-AIDS patients. The AIDS group was also more likely to have a diagnosis of organic mental disorder, particularly dementia. There were no other differences in Axis I diagnoses, including depression, substance abuse, and adjustment disorder. Suicidal risk was no greater in the AIDS patients than in the non-AIDS patients. Axis II diagnoses were made more often in the non-AIDS patients, who also required more one-to-one nursing supervision. Consultation in AIDS patients took more staff time, and AIDS patients were more likely to have required one or more repeat consultations within the period of the study, thus creating a heavier burden on consultation staff.

Results suggest that across all indicators of mental health, spouse caregivers are more depressed, express higher levels of negative affect, are more likely to use psychotropic drugs, and have more symptoms of psychological distress than the general population. In terms of physical health, caregivers report higher than expected rates of diabetes, arthritis, ulcers, and anemia, yet they use medical services at rates which are similar or lower than those reported by the general population. Since no simultaneous control group was studied, these results suggest, but do not prove, the presence of differences between caregivers and non-caregivers.",[],Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1989-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Pruchno', 'firstname': 'R A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Philadelphia Geriatric Center, PA 19141.'}, {'lastname': 'Potashnik', 'firstname': 'S L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1532-5415.1989.tb02230.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dba98c70>,,,,,,
327,2730277,Cerebral glucose metabolic patterns in Alzheimer's disease. Effect of gender and age at dementia onset.,"No previous study of Alzheimer's disease has, to our knowledge, assessed the effect of both age at dementia onset and gender on cerebral glucose metabolic patterns. To this end, we used positron emission tomography (fludeoxyglucose F 18 method) to study 24 patients with clinical diagnoses of probable Alzheimer's disease. Comparisons of the 13 patients with early-onset dementia (less than 65 years of age) with the 11 patients with late-onset dementia (greater than 65 years of age) revealed significantly lower left parietal metabolic ratios (left posterior parietal region divided by the hemispheric average) in the early-onset group. The metabolic ratio of posterior parietal cortex divided by the relatively disease-stable average of caudate and thalamus also separated patients with early-onset dementia from those with late-onset dementia, but not men from women. Further comparisons between sexes showed that, in all brain regions studied, the 9 postmenopausal women had higher nonweighted mean metabolic rates than the 15 men from the same age group, with hemispheric sex differences of 9% on the right and 7% on the left. These results demonstrate decreased parietal ratios in early-onset dementia of Alzheimer's disease, independent of a gender effect.",[],Archives of general psychiatry,1989-06-01,"[{'lastname': 'Small', 'firstname': 'G W', 'initials': 'GW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, UCLA School of Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuhl', 'firstname': 'D E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Riege', 'firstname': 'W H', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fujikawa', 'firstname': 'D G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ashford', 'firstname': 'J W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Metter', 'firstname': 'E J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mazziotta', 'firstname': 'J C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1001/archpsyc.1989.01810060047008,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbaa0220>,,,,,,
328,3651673,Measuring the rising tide. How many dementia cases will there be by 2001?,"Numerous surveys have attempted to estimate the prevalence of dementia. Despite difficulties of measurement, evidence suggests figures may be lower than is generally realised. Factors which are likely to affect prevalence rates are discussed.

6033499",The new chronic psychiatric population.,"Data from the Camberwell Register are used to examine the accumulation of a new chronic population in three forms of psychiatric care—inpatient, day patient, and hostel care. For the period 1964-72, against the background of expanding psychiatric services, the number and characteristics of new long-stay patients in each form of care are analysed. The net accumulation of new long-stay inpatients stabilized after a few years; the population of long-stay day patients and residents in psychiatric hostels was still increasing. The epidemiological basis of the study allows the numbers to be expressed as rates per head of population.",[],British journal of preventive & social medicine,1974-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hailey', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1136/jech.28.3.180,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dba3aa90>,,,,,,
