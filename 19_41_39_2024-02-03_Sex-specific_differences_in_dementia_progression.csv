37189731",The role of microRNAs in understanding sex-based differences in Alzheimer's disease.,"The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-the most frequent cause of dementia-is expected to increase as life expectancies rise across the globe. While sex-based differences in AD have previously been described, there remain uncertainties regarding any association between sex and disease-associated molecular mechanisms. Studying sex-specific expression profiles of regulatory factors such as microRNAs (miRNAs) could contribute to more accurate disease diagnosis and treatment.
A systematic review identified six studies of microRNA expression in AD patients that incorporated information regarding the biological sex of samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository. A differential microRNA expression analysis was performed, considering disease status and patient sex. Subsequently, results were integrated within a meta-analysis methodology, with a functional enrichment of meta-analysis results establishing an association between altered miRNA expression and relevant Gene Ontology terms.
Meta-analyses of miRNA expression profiles in blood samples revealed the alteration of sixteen miRNAs in female and 22 miRNAs in male AD patients. We discovered nine miRNAs commonly overexpressed in both sexes, suggesting a shared miRNA dysregulation profile. Functional enrichment results based on miRNA profiles revealed sex-based differences in biological processes; most affected processes related to ubiquitination, regulation of different kinase activities, and apoptotic processes in males, but RNA splicing and translation in females. Meta-analyses of miRNA expression profiles in brain samples revealed the alteration of six miRNAs in female and four miRNAs in male AD patients. We observed a single underexpressed miRNA in female and male AD patients (hsa-miR-767-5p); however, the functional enrichment analysis for brain samples did not reveal any specifically affected biological process.
Sex-specific meta-analyses supported the detection of differentially expressed miRNAs in female and male AD patients, highlighting the relevance of sex-based information in biomedical data. Further studies on miRNA regulation in AD patients should meet the criteria for comparability and standardization of information.
Alzheimer's disease (AD)—a neurodegenerative disease mainly affecting older patients—is characterized by cognitive deterioration, memory loss, and progressive incapacitation in daily activities. While AD affects almost twice as many females as males, and cognitive deterioration and brain atrophy develop more rapidly in females, the biological causes of these differences remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and impact a wide variety of biological processes; therefore, studying the differential expression of miRNAs in female and male AD patients could contribute to a better understanding of the disease. We reviewed studies of miRNA expression in female and male AD patients and integrated results using a meta-analysis methodology and then identified those genes regulated by the altered miRNAs to establish an association with biological processes. We found 16 (females) and 22 (males) miRNAs altered in the blood of AD patients. Functional enrichment revealed sex-based differences in the affected altered biological processes—protein modification and degradation and cell death in male AD patients and RNA processing in female AD patients. A similar analysis in the brains of AD patients revealed six (females) and four (males) miRNAs with altered expression; however, our analysis failed to highlight any specifically altered biological processes. Overall, we highlight the sex-based differential expression of miRNAs (and biological processes affected) in the blood and brain of AD patients.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Biomarkers', 'Meta-analysis', 'MicroRNAs', 'Sex-based differences', 'Systematic review', 'Transcriptomics']",Biology of sex differences,2024-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Llera-Oyola', 'firstname': 'Jaime', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Computational Biomedicine Laboratory, Príncipe Felipe Research Center (CIPF), C/ Eduardo Primo Yúfera, 3, 46012, Valencia, Spain.\nCarlos Simon Foundation-INCLIVA Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Carceller', 'firstname': 'Héctor', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Neurobiology Unit, Program in Neurosciences and Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine (BIOTECMED), Universitat de València, Burjassot, Spain.\nCentro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Salud Mental (CIBERSAM), Spanish National Network for Research in Mental Health, Madrid, Spain.\nJoint Unit in Biomedical Imaging FISABIO-CIPF, Foundation for the Promotion of Health and Biomedical Research of Valencia Region, València, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Andreu', 'firstname': 'Zoraida', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Foundation Valencian Institute of Oncology (FIVO), 46009, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Hidalgo', 'firstname': 'Marta R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Computational Biomedicine Laboratory, Príncipe Felipe Research Center (CIPF), C/ Eduardo Primo Yúfera, 3, 46012, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Soler-Sáez', 'firstname': 'Irene', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Computational Biomedicine Laboratory, Príncipe Felipe Research Center (CIPF), C/ Eduardo Primo Yúfera, 3, 46012, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gordillo', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Computational Biomedicine Laboratory, Príncipe Felipe Research Center (CIPF), C/ Eduardo Primo Yúfera, 3, 46012, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gómez-Cabañes', 'firstname': 'Borja', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Computational Biomedicine Laboratory, Príncipe Felipe Research Center (CIPF), C/ Eduardo Primo Yúfera, 3, 46012, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Roson', 'firstname': 'Beatriz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Carlos Simon Foundation-INCLIVA Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'de la Iglesia-Vayá', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Joint Unit in Biomedical Imaging FISABIO-CIPF, Foundation for the Promotion of Health and Biomedical Research of Valencia Region, València, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mancuso', 'firstname': 'Roberta', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, 20148, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Guerini', 'firstname': 'Franca R', 'initials': 'FR', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, 20148, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mizokami', 'firstname': 'Akiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Oral Health/Brain Health/Total Health (OBT) Research Center, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'García-García', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Computational Biomedicine Laboratory, Príncipe Felipe Research Center (CIPF), C/ Eduardo Primo Yúfera, 3, 46012, Valencia, Spain. fgarcia@cipf.es.'}]",,,"Meta-analyses of miRNA expression profiles in blood samples revealed the alteration of sixteen miRNAs in female and 22 miRNAs in male AD patients.

15919549",Olfactory and cognitive decrements in 1991 Gulf War veterans with gulf war illness/chronic multisymptom illness.,"Gulf War illness (GWI)/Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI) is a disorder related to military service in the 1991 Gulf War (GW). Prominent symptoms of GWI/CMI include fatigue, pain, and cognitive dysfunction. Although anosmia is not a typical GWI/CMI symptom, anecdotally some GW veterans have reported losing their sense smell shortly after the war. Because olfactory deficit is a prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and because we previously reported suggestive evidence that deployed GW veterans may be at increased risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia, the current study examined the relationship between olfactory and cognitive function in deployed GW veterans.
Eighty deployed GW veterans (mean age: 59.9  ±7.0; 4 female) were tested remotely with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Veterans also completed self-report questionnaires about their health and deployment-related exposures and experiences. UPSIT and MoCA data from healthy control (HC) participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study were downloaded for comparison.
GW veterans had a mean UPSIT score of 27.8  ± 6.3 (range 9-37) and a mean MoCA score of 25.3  ± 2.8 (range 19-30). According to age- and sex-specific normative data, 31% of GW veterans (vs. 8% PPMI HCs) had UPSIT scores below the 10th percentile. Nearly half (45%) of GW veterans (vs. 8% PPMI HCs) had MoCA scores below the cut-off for identifying MCI. Among GW veterans, but not PPMI HCs, there was a positive correlation between UPSIT and MoCA scores (Spearman's ρ = 0.39, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in UPSIT or MoCA scores between GW veterans with and without history of COVID or between those with and without Kansas GWI exclusionary conditions.
We found evidence of olfactory and cognitive deficits and a significant correlation between UPSIT and MoCA scores in a cohort of 80 deployed GW veterans, 99% of whom had CMI. Because impaired olfactory function has been associated with increased risk for MCI and dementia, it may be prudent to screen aging, deployed GW veterans with smell identification tests so that hypo- and anosmic veterans can be followed longitudinally and offered targeted neuroprotective therapies as they become available.","['Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Gulf war', 'Olfaction, neurotoxicant', 'Veterans']",Environmental health : a global access science source,2024-01-31,"[{'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Linda L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging and Psychiatry & Behavioral Science, University of Calfiornia, 505 Parnassus Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA. linda.chao@ucsf.edu.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, 4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, CA, 94121, USA. linda.chao@ucsf.edu.'}]",,,"GW veterans had a mean UPSIT score of 27.8  ± 6.3 (range 9-37) and a mean MoCA score of 25.3  ± 2.8 (range 19-30).

29916024",Blockage of VEGF function by bevacizumab alleviates early-stage cerebrovascular dysfunction and improves cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the predominant type of dementia worldwide. It is characterized by the progressive and irreversible decline of cognitive functions. In addition to the pathological beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, glial activation, and neuronal injury in the postmortem brains of AD patients, increasing evidence suggests that the often overlooked vascular dysfunction is an important early event in AD pathophysiology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in regulating physiological functions and pathological changes in blood vessels, but whether VEGF is involved in the early stage of vascular pathology in AD remains unclear.
We used an antiangiogenic agent for clinical cancer treatment, the humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, to block VEGF binding to its receptors in the 5×FAD mouse model at an early age. After treatment, memory performance was evaluated by a novel object recognition test, and cerebral vascular permeability and perfusion were examined by an Evans blue assay and blood flow scanning imaging analysis. Immunofluorescence staining was used to measure glial activation and Aβ deposits. VEGF and its receptors were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate bevacizumab-associated transcriptional signatures in the hippocampus of 5×FAD mice.
Bevacizumab treatment administered from 4 months of age dramatically improved cerebrovascular functions, reduced glial activation, and restored long-term memory in both sexes of 5×FAD mice. Notably, a sex-specific change in different VEGF receptors was identified in the cortex and hippocampus of 5×FAD mice. Soluble VEGFR1 was decreased in female mice, while full-length VEGFR2 was increased in male mice. Bevacizumab treatment reversed the altered expression of receptors to be comparable to the level in the wild-type mice. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of transcriptomic changes revealed that bevacizumab effectively reversed the changes in the gene sets associated with blood-brain barrier integrity and vascular smooth muscle contraction in 5×FAD mice.
Our study demonstrated the mechanistic roles of VEGF at the early stage of amyloidopathy and the protective effects of bevacizumab on cerebrovascular function and memory performance in 5×FAD mice. These findings also suggest the therapeutic potential of bevacizumab for the early intervention of AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Bevacizumab', 'Cerebrovascular function', 'Vascular endothelial growth

3,38143367,Sex-Specific Early Retinal Dysfunction in Mutant TDP-43 Transgenic Mice.,"Increasing evidence has highlighted retinal impairments in neurodegenerative diseases. Dominant mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm is a pathological hallmark of ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and many other neurodegenerative diseases.
While homozygous transgenic mice expressing the disease-causing human TDP-43 M337V mutant (TDP-43M337V mice) experience premature death, hemizygous TDP-43M337V mice do not suffer sudden death, but they exhibit age-dependent motor-coordinative and cognitive deficits. This study aims to leverage the hemizygous TDP-43M337V mice as a valuable ALS/FTD disease model for the assessment also of retinal changes during the disease progression.
We evaluated the retinal function of young TDP-43M337V mice by full field electroretinogram (ERG) recordings.
At 3-4 months of age, well before the onset of brain dysfunction at 8 months, the ERG responses were notably impaired in the retinas of young female TDP-43M337V mice in contrast to their male counterparts and age-matched non-transgenic mice. Mitochondria have been implicated as critical targets of TDP-43. Further investigation revealed that significant changes in the key regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics were only observed in the retinas of young female TDP-43M337V mice, while these alterations were not present in the brains of either gender.
Together our findings suggest a sex-specific vulnerability within the retina in the early disease stage, and highlight the importance of retinal changes and mitochondrial markers as potential early diagnostic indicators for ALS, FTD, and other TDP-43 related neurodegenerative conditions.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'OXPHOS', 'TDP-43', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'frontotemporal dementia', 'mitochondrial dynamics', 'retina', 'sex differences']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-12-25,"[{'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Ju', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Leinonen', 'firstname': 'Henri', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Evan J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ding', 'firstname': 'Mao', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'College of Sciences, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Palczewski', 'firstname': 'Krzysztof', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, UCI, Irvine, CA, USA.\nDepartment of Physiology and Biophysics, Chemistry and Molecular Biology and Biochemsitry, UCI, Irvine, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xinglong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}]",,,"At 3-4 months of age, well before the onset of brain dysfunction at 8 months, the ERG responses were notably impaired in the retinas of young female TDP-43M337V mice in contrast to their male counterparts and age-matched non-transgenic mice.

4,37988283,Sex-specific modulation of amyloid-β on tau phosphorylation underlies faster tangle accumulation in females.,"Females are disproportionately affected by dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Despite a similar Aβ load, females showed a higher load of neurofibrillary tangle as compared to males. Previous literature has proposed that Aβ and p-tau synergism accelerates tau tangle formation, yet the effect of biological sex in this process was overlooked. In this observational study, we examined longitudinal neuroimaging data from two cohorts, the TRIAD cohort in Canada, and the ADNI cohort in the United States. We assessed a total number of 457 participants across the clinical spectrum of AD. All participants underwent a baseline multimodal imaging assessment, including MRIs and PET scans with radioligands targeting Aβ plaques and tau tangles respectively. CSF data was also collected. Follow-up imaging assessments were conducted at the 1-year and 2-year intervals for the TRIAD cohort, and at the 1-year, 2-year and 4-year intervals for the ADNI cohort. The goal of the present study was to investigate the upstream pathological events contributing to the faster tau progression observed in females. Specifically, we assessed if the contribution of Aβ and p-tau synergism on accelerated tau tangle formation was modulated by the biological sex. We hypothesized that the cortical Aβ predisposes tau phosphorylation and tangle accumulation in a sex-specific manner. Findings from this study revealed that Aβ-positive females presented higher CSF p-tau181 concentrations as compared to Aβ-positive males in both TRIAD (P = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.51) and ADNI cohort (P = 0.027, Cohen's d = 0.41). In addition, Aβ-positive females also presented faster NFT accumulation compared to their male counterparts (TRIAD: P = 0.026, Cohen's d = 0.52; ADNI: P = 0.049, Cohen's d = 1.14). Finally, findings from this present study unveiled that the triple interaction between female sex, Aβ and CSF p-tau181 is a significant predictor of accelerated tau accumulation at the 2-year follow-up visit (Braak I: P = 0.0067, t = 2.81; Braak III: P = 0.017, t = 2.45; Braak IV: P = 0.002, t = 3.17; Braak V: P = 0.006, t = 2.88; Braak VI: P = 0.0049, t = 2.93). Overall, this study reported a sex-specific modulation of cortical Aβ on tau phosphorylation, and this consequently facilitates faster NFT progression seen in female individuals over time. This presents important clinical implications suggesting the early intervention targeting Aβ plaques and tau phosphorylation may be promising therapeutic strategies for females to prevent further accumulation and spread of tau aggregates.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'amyloid-β', 'phosphorylated tau', 'sex difference', 'tau progression']",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023-11-21,"[{'lastname':

10822435",Sex differences in longitudinal changes of episodic memory-related brain activity and cognition in cognitively unimpaired older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease.,"Episodic memory decline is an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) - a neurodegenerative disease that has a higher prevalence rate in older females compared to older males. However, little is known about why these sex differences in prevalence rate exist. In the current longitudinal task fMRI study, we explored whether there were sex differences in the patterns of memory decline and brain activity during object-location (spatial context) encoding and retrieval in a large sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Novel or Experimental Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT-AD) program who are at heightened risk of developing AD due to having a family history (+FH) of the disease. The goal of the study was to gain insight into whether there are sex differences in the neural correlates of episodic memory decline, which may advance knowledge about sex-specific patterns in the natural progression to AD. Our results indicate that +FH females performed better than +FH males at both baseline and follow-up on neuropsychological and task fMRI measures of episodic memory. Moreover, multivariate data-driven task fMRI analysis identified generalized patterns of longitudinal decline in medial temporal lobe activity that was paralleled by longitudinal increases in lateral prefrontal cortex, caudate and midline cortical activity during successful episodic retrieval and novelty detection in +FH males, but not females. Post-hoc analyses indicated that higher education had a stronger effect on +FH females neuropsychological scores compared to +FH males. We conclude that higher educational attainment may have a greater neuroprotective effect in older +FH females compared to +FH males.","['Cognition', 'Episodic memory', 'Family history of Alzheimer’s disease', 'Longitudinal study', 'Sex differences', 'Task-related functional MRI']",NeuroImage.

6,37910662,Identifying Sex-Specific Serum Patterns of Alzheimer's Mice through Deep TMT Profiling and a Concentration-Dependent Concatenation Strategy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, disproportionately affecting women in disease prevalence and progression. Comprehensive analysis of the serum proteome in a common AD mouse model offers potential in identifying possible AD pathology- and gender-associated biomarkers. Here, we introduce a multiplexed, nondepleted mouse serum proteome profiling via tandem mass-tag (TMTpro) labeling. The labeled sample was separated into 475 fractions using basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), which were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-concentration fractions for concatenation. This concentration-dependent concatenation strategy resulted in 128 fractions for acidic RPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, collecting ∼5 million MS/MS scans and identifying 3972 unique proteins (3413 genes) that cover a dynamic range spanning at least 6 orders of magnitude. The differential expression analysis between wild type and the commonly used AD model (5xFAD) mice exhibited minimal significant protein alterations. However, we detected 60 statistically significant (FDR < 0.05), sex-specific proteins, including complement components, serpins, carboxylesterases, major urinary proteins, cysteine-rich secretory protein 1, pregnancy-associated murine protein 1, prolactin, amyloid P component, epidermal growth factor receptor, fibrinogen-like protein 1, and hepcidin. The results suggest that our platform possesses the sensitivity and reproducibility required to detect sex-specific differentially expressed proteins in mouse serum samples.","['AD', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'TMT', 'biomarker', 'blood', 'isobaric labeling', 'liquid chromatography', 'mass spectrometry', 'murine', 'proteome', 'proteomics', 'serum', 'sex difference']",Journal of proteome research,2023-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Dey', 'firstname': 'Kaushik Kumar', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yarbro', 'firstname': 'Jay M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Danting', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Xian', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhen', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jiao', 'firstname': 'Yun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Zhiping', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Shu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'DongGeun', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dasgupta', 'firstname': 'Abhijit', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Zuo-Fei', 'initials': 'ZF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xusheng', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Liqin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Junmin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00496,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df3764a0>

17239451",Small Molecule Pytren-4QMn Metal Complex Slows down Huntington's Disease Progression in Male zQ175 Transgenic Mice.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder considered a rare disease with a prevalence of 5.7 per 100,000 people. It is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation consisting of expansions of trinucleotide repeats that translate into poly-glutamine enlarged mutant huntingtin proteins (mHTT), which are particularly deleterious in brain tissues. Since there is no cure for this progressive fatal disease, searches for new therapeutic approaches are much needed. The small molecule pytren-4QMn (4QMn), a highly water-soluble mimic of the enzyme superoxide dismutase, has shown in vivo beneficial anti-inflammatory activity in mice and was able to remove mHTT deposits in a C. elegans model of HD. In this study, we assessed 4QMn therapeutic potential in zQ175 neo-deleted knock-in mice, a model of HD that closely mimics the heterozygosity, genetic injury, and progressive nature of the human disease. We provide evidence that 4QMn has good acute and chronic tolerability, and can cross the blood-brain barrier, and in male, but not female, zQ175 mice moderately ameliorate HD-altered gene expression, mHtt aggregation, and HD disease phenotype. Our data highlight the importance of considering sex-specific differences when testing new therapies using animal models and postulate 4QMn as a potential novel type of small water-soluble metal complex that could be worth further investigating for its therapeutic potential in HD, as well as in other polyglutamine diseases.","['4QMn', 'Huntington’s disease', 'Mn (II) complexes', 'Q175 mice', 'polyglutamine diseases', 'sex differences']",International journal of molecular sciences,2023-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Merino', 'firstname': 'Marián', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Bionos Biotech SL, Biopolo Hospital La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González', 'firstname': 'Sonia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Bionos Biotech SL, Biopolo Hospital La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Tronch', 'firstname': 'Mª Carmen', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Bionos Biotech SL, Biopolo Hospital La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sánchez-Sánchez', 'firstname': 'Ana Virginia', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Bionos Biotech SL, Biopolo Hospital La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Clares', 'firstname': 'Mª Paz', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Química Orgánica e Inorgánica, Instituto de Ciencia Molecular, Universidad de Valencia, 46980 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'García-España', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Bionos Biotech SL, Biopolo Hospital La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'García-España', 'firstname': 'Enrique', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Química Orgánica e Inorgánica, Instituto de Ciencia Molecular, Universidad de Valencia, 46980 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mullor', 'firstname': 'José L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Bionos Biotech SL, Biopolo Hospital La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms242015153

8,37639492,Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 exhibits sex-specific prognostication of cognitive decline and brain atrophy in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"Accumulating evidence indicates disproportionate tau burden and tau-related clinical progression in females. However, sex differences in plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 prediction of subclinical cognitive and brain changes are unknown.
We measured baseline plasma p-tau217, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL) in 163 participants (85 cognitively unimpaired [CU], 78 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). In CU, linear mixed effects models examined sex differences in plasma biomarker prediction of longitudinal domain-specific cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Cognitive models were repeated in MCI.
In CU females, baseline plasma p-tau217 predicted verbal memory and medial temporal lobe trajectories such that trajectories significantly declined once p-tau217 concentrations surpassed 0.053 pg/ml, a threshold that corresponded to early levels of cortical amyloid aggregation in secondary amyloid positron emission tomography analyses. CU males exhibited similar rates of cognitive decline and brain atrophy, but these trajectories were not dependent on plasma p-tau217. Plasma GFAP and NfL exhibited similar female-specific prediction of medial temporal lobe atrophy in CU. Plasma p-tau217 exhibited comparable prediction of cognitive decline across sex in MCI.
Plasma p-tau217 may capture earlier Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cognitive and brain atrophy hallmarks in females compared to males, possibly reflective of increased susceptibility to AD pathophysiology.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid positron emission tomography', 'cognition', 'cognitively unimpaired', 'glial fibrillary acidic protein', 'medial temporal lobe', 'neurofilament light', 'phosphorylated tau217', 'plasma biomarkers', 'sex differences', 'verbal memory']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2023-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Saloner', 'firstname': 'Rowan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'VandeVrede', 'firstname': 'Lawren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Asken', 'firstname': 'Breton M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Paolillo', 'firstname': 'Emily W', 'initials': 'EW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gontrum', 'firstname': 'Eva Q', 'initials': 'EQ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wolf', 'firstname': 'Amy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lario-Lago', 'firstname': 'Argentina', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Milà-Alomà', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Triana-Baltzer', 'firstname': 'Gallen', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Biomarkers, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, San Diego, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kolb', 'firstname': 'Hartmuth C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Biomarkers, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, San Diego, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubal', 'firstname': 'Dena B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rabinovici', 'firstname': 'Gil D', 'initials': 'GD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'Bruce L', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Boxer', 'firstname': 'Adam L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Casaletto', 'firstname': 'Kaitlin B', 'initials': 'KB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kramer', 'firstname': 'Joel H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}]",,,"In CU females, baseline plasma p-tau217 predicted verbal memory and medial temporal lobe trajectories such that trajectories significantly declined once p-tau217 concentrations surpassed 0.053 pg/ml, a threshold that corresponded to early levels of cortical amyloid aggregation in secondary amyloid positron emission tomography analyses.

36624497",Microglial senescence contributes to female-biased neuroinflammation in the aging mouse hippocampus: implications for Alzheimer's disease.,"Microglia, the brain's principal immune cells, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition shown to affect more females than males. Although sex differences in microglial function and transcriptomic programming have been described across development and in disease models of AD, no studies have comprehensively identified the sex divergences that emerge in the aging mouse hippocampus. Further, existing models of AD generally develop pathology (amyloid plaques and tau tangles) early in life and fail to recapitulate the aged brain environment associated with late-onset AD. Here, we examined and compared transcriptomic and translatomic sex effects in young and old murine hippocampal microglia.
Hippocampal tissue from C57BL6/N and microglial NuTRAP mice of both sexes were collected at young (5-6 month-old [mo]) and old (22-25 mo) ages. Cell sorting and affinity purification techniques were used to isolate the microglial transcriptome and translatome for RNA-sequencing and differential expression analyses. Flow cytometry, qPCR, and imaging approaches were used to confirm the transcriptomic and translatomic findings.
There were marginal sex differences identified in the young hippocampal microglia, with most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) restricted to the sex chromosomes. Both sex chromosomally and autosomally encoded sex differences emerged with aging. These sex DEGs identified at old age were primarily female-biased and enriched in senescent and disease-associated microglial signatures. Normalized gene expression values can be accessed through a searchable web interface ( https://neuroepigenomics.omrf.org/ ). Pathway analyses identified upstream regulators induced to a greater extent in females than in males, including inflammatory mediators IFNG, TNF, and IL1B, as well as AD-risk genes TREM2 and APP.
These data suggest that female microglia adopt disease-associated and senescent phenotypes in the aging mouse hippocampus, even in the absence of disease pathology, to a greater extent than males. This sexually divergent microglial phenotype may explain the difference in susceptibility and disease progression in the case of AD pathology. Future studies will need to explore sex differences in microglial heterogeneity in response to AD pathology and determine how sex-specific regulators (i.e., sex chromosomal or hormonal) elicit these sex effects.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Brain aging', 'Disease-associated microglia', 'Hippocampus', 'Microglia', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Senescence', 'Sex divergence', 'Sex effects', 'Transcriptomics']",Journal of neuroinflammation,2023-08-17,"[{'lastname': 'Ocañas', 'firstname': 'Sarah R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.\nDepartment of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pham', 'firstname': 'Kevin D', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cox', 'firstname': 'Jillian E J', 'initials': 'JEJ', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.\nGraduate Program in Biomedical Sciences, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Keck', 'firstname': 'Alex W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ko', 'firstname': 'Sunghwan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.\nGraduate Program in Biomedical Sciences, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ampadu', 'firstname': 'Felix A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Porter', 'firstname': 'Hunter L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ansere', 'firstname': 'Victor A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.\nDepartment of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kulpa', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kellogg', 'firstname': 'Collyn M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Machalinski', 'firstname': 'Adeline H', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Manu A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wright', 'firstname': 'Zsabre', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chucair-Elliott', 'firstname': 'Ana J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Freeman', 'firstname': 'Willard M', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Genes and Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 825 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA. bill-freeman@omrf.org.\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA. bill-freeman@omrf.org.\nOklahoma City Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA. bill-freeman@omrf.org.'}]",,,"There were marginal sex differences identified in the young hippocampal microglia, with most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) restricted to the sex chromosomes.

27699940",Sex-Specific Effects of Anxiety on Cognition and Activity-Dependent Neural Networks: Insights from (Female) Mice and (Wo)Men.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), such as depression and anxiety, are observed in 90% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, two-thirds of whom are women. NPS usually manifest long before AD onset creating a therapeutic opportunity. Here, we examined the impact of anxiety on AD progression and the underlying brain-wide neuronal mechanisms.
To gain mechanistic insight into how anxiety impacts AD progression, we performed a cross-sectional analysis on mood, cognition, and neural activity utilizing the ArcCreER
Female AD mice exhibited anxiety-like behavior and cognitive decline at an earlier age than control (Ctrl) mice and male mice. Brain-wide analysis of c-Fos
While future studies are needed to understand whether anxiety is a predictor, a neuropsychiatric biomarker, or a comorbid symptom that occurs during disease onset, these results suggest that AD network dysfunction is sexually dimorphic, and that personalized medicine may benefit male and female AD patients rather than a one size fits all approach.","['Arc', 'engrams', 'hippocampus', 'immediate early gene', 'memory', 'sex differences']",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Hunsberger', 'firstname': 'Holly C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Systems Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc.

27942728",Biological and Clinical Implications of Sex-Specific Differences in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Mounting evidence indicates that the female sex is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Decades of research suggest that sex-specific differences in genetics, environmental factors, hormones, comorbidities, and brain structure and function may contribute to AD development. However, although significant progress has been made in uncovering specific genetic factors and biological pathways, the precise mechanisms underlying sex-biased differences are not fully characterized. Here, we review several lines of evidence, including epidemiological, clinical, and molecular studies addressing sex differences in AD. In addition, we discuss the challenges and future directions in advancing personalized treatments for AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Dementia', 'Personalized medicine', 'Sex-differences']",Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2023-07-18,"[{'lastname': 'Santiago', 'firstname': 'Jose A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'NeuroHub Analytics, LLC, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Potashkin', 'firstname': 'Judith A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Department, Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Therapeutics, The Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL, USA. judy.potashkin@rosalindfranklin.edu.'}]",,,,"© 2023.

12,37385457,Sex representation in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders' preclinical and clinical studies.,"Many studies show the importance of biological sex for the onset, progression, and response to treatment in brain disorders. In line with these reports, health agencies have requested that all trials, both at the clinical and preclinical level, use a similar number of male and female subjects to correctly interpret the results. Despite these guidelines, many studies still tend to be unbalanced in the use of male and female subjects. In this review we consider three neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and three psychiatric disorders: Depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Schizophrenia. These disorders were chosen because of their prevalence and their recognized sex-specific differences in onset, progression, and response to treatment. Alzheimer's disease and Depression demonstrate higher prevalence in females, whereas Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and schizophrenia show higher prevalence in males. Results from preclinical and clinical studies examining each of these disorders revealed sex-specific differences in risk factors, diagnostic biomarkers, and treatment response and efficacy, suggesting a role for sex-specific therapies in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the qualitative analysis of the percentage of males and females enrolled in clinical trials in the last two decades shows that for most of the disorders, there is still a sex bias in the patients' enrolment.","['Biological sex', 'Clinical trial', 'Neurodegenerative', 'Neuropsychiatric', 'Sex', 'Sex representation', 'Sex-specific difference']",Neurobiology of disease,2023-06-30,"[{'lastname': 'DuMont', 'firstname': 'Mieke', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Agostinis', 'firstname': 'Alyssa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Kiran', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Swan', 'firstname': 'Evan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Buttle', 'firstname': 'Yvonne', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Tropea', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Trinity Translational Medicine Institute (TTMI), Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Lloyd Building, Dublin 2, Dublin, Ireland; FutureNeuro, the SFI Research Centre for Chronic and Rare Neurological Diseases.

19497050",Sex specific molecular networks and key drivers of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that affects women disproportionally. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly characterized. Moreover, while the interplay between sex and ApoE genotype in AD has been investigated, multi-omics studies to understand this interaction are limited. Therefore, we applied systems biology approaches to investigate sex-specific molecular networks of AD.
We integrated large-scale human postmortem brain transcriptomic data of AD from two cohorts (MSBB and ROSMAP) via multiscale network analysis and identified key drivers with sexually dimorphic expression patterns and/or different responses to APOE genotypes between sexes. The expression patterns and functional relevance of the top sex-specific network driver of AD were further investigated using postmortem human brain samples and gene perturbation experiments in AD mouse models.
Gene expression changes in AD versus control were identified for each sex. Gene co-expression networks were constructed for each sex to identify AD-associated co-expressed gene modules shared by males and females or specific to each sex. Key network regulators were further identified as potential drivers of sex differences in AD development. LRP10 was identified as a top driver of the sex differences in AD pathogenesis and manifestation. Changes of LRP10 expression at the mRNA and protein levels were further validated in human AD brain samples. Gene perturbation experiments in EFAD mouse models demonstrated that LRP10 differentially affected cognitive function and AD pathology in sex- and APOE genotype-specific manners. A comprehensive mapping of brain cells in LRP10 over-expressed (OE) female E4FAD mice suggested neurons and microglia as the most affected cell populations. The female-specific targets of LRP10 identified from the single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of the LRP10 OE E4FAD mouse brains were significantly enriched in the LRP10-centered subnetworks in female AD subjects, validating LRP10 as a key network regulator of AD in females. Eight LRP10 binding partners were identified by the yeast two-hybrid system screening, and LRP10 over-expression reduced the association of LRP10 with one binding partner CD34.
These findings provide insights into key mechanisms mediating sex differences in AD pathogenesis and will facilitate the development of sex- and APOE genotype-specific therapies for AD.","['APOE genotype', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Gene co-expression network', 'Key driver genes', 'LDL receptor related protein 10 (LRP10)', 'Sex difference']",Molecular neurodegeneration,2023-06-21,"[{'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nMount Sinai Center for Transformative Disease Modeling, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Jiqing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nJames J Peters VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Jianwei', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nJames J Peters VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yonghe', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Min', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nJames J Peters VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nJames J Peters VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Larry', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nJames J Peters VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Yeji', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'James J Peters VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Duarte', 'firstname': 'Mariana Lemos', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nJames J Peters VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Xianxiao', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nMount Sinai Center for Transformative Disease Modeling, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Minghui', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nMount Sinai Center for Transformative Disease Modeling, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chia-Chen', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Martens', 'firstname': 'Yuka', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.\nRonald M.

32056347",Sex-specific associations of matrix metalloproteinases in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be characterised in vivo by biomarkers reflecting amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology. However, there is a need for biomarkers reflecting additional pathological pathways. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have recently been highlighted as candidate biomarkers for sex-specific mechanisms and progression in AD.
In this cross-sectional study, we investigated nine MMPs and four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in the cerebrospinal fluid of 256 memory clinic patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD and 100 cognitively unimpaired age-matched controls. We studied group differences in MMP/TIMP levels and examined the associations with established markers of Aβ and tau pathology as well as disease progression. Further, we studied sex-specific interactions.
MMP-10 and TIMP-2 levels differed significantly between the memory clinic patients and the cognitively unimpaired controls. Furthermore, MMP- and TIMP-levels were generally strongly associated with tau biomarkers, whereas only MMP-3 and TIMP-4 were associated with Aβ biomarkers; these associations were sex-specific. In terms of progression, we found a trend towards higher MMP-10 at baseline predicting more cognitive and functional decline over time exclusively in women.
Our results support the use of MMPs/TIMPs as markers of sex differences and progression in AD. Our findings show sex-specific effects of MMP-3 and TIMP-4 on amyloid pathology. Further, this study highlights that the sex-specific effects of MMP-10 on cognitive and functional decline should be studied further if MMP-10 is to be used as a prognostic biomarker for AD.","['Alzheimer disease', 'Biomarkers', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cognitive decline', 'Matrix metalloproteinases', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'Prognosis', 'Sex differences', 'Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases']",Biology of sex differences,2023-05-24,"[{'lastname': 'Aksnes', 'firstname': 'Mari', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, University of Oslo, 0315, Oslo, Norway. mari.aksnes@medisin.uio.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Edwin', 'firstname': 'Trine H', 'initials': 'TH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, 0450, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Saltvedt', 'firstname': 'Ingvild', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7030, Trondheim, Norway.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Clinic of Medicine, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, 7030, Trondheim, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Eldholm', 'firstname': 'Rannveig S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7030, Trondheim, Norway.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Clinic of Medicine, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, 7030, Trondheim, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaudhry', 'firstname': 'Farrukh A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Oslo, 0315, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Halaas', 'firstname': 'Nathalie B', 'initials': 'NB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, University of Oslo, 0315, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, 0450, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Myrstad', 'firstname': 'Marius', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Bærum Hospital, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, 1346, Gjettum, Norway.\nDepartment of Medical Research, Bærum Hospital, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, 1346, Gjettum, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Watne', 'firstname': 'Leiv O', 'initials': 'LO', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Campus Ahus, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Knapskog', 'firstname': 'Anne-Brita', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, 0450, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,"Our results support the use of MMPs/TIMPs as markers of sex differences and progression in AD.

29482212",Sex difference in evolution of cognitive decline: studies on mouse model and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network cohort.,"Women carry a higher burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to men, which is not accounted entirely by differences in lifespan. To identify the mechanisms underlying this effect, we investigated sex-specific differences in the progression of familial AD in humans and in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Activity dependent protein translation and associative learning and memory deficits were examined in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice and wild-type mice. As a human comparator group, progression of cognitive dysfunction was assessed in mutation carriers and non-carriers from DIAN (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network) cohort. Female APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice did not show recall deficits after contextual fear conditioning until 8 months of age. Further, activity dependent protein translation and Akt1-mTOR signaling at the synapse were impaired in male but not in female mice until 8 months of age. Ovariectomized APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice displayed recall deficits at 4 months of age and these were sustained until 8 months of age. Moreover, activity dependent protein translation was also impaired in 4 months old ovariectomized APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice compared with sham female APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Progression of memory impairment differed between men and women in the DIAN cohort as analyzed using linear mixed effects model, wherein men showed steeper cognitive decline irrespective of the age of entry in the study, while women showed significantly greater performance and slower decline in immediate recall (LOGIMEM) and delayed recall (MEMUNITS) than men. However, when the performance of men and women in several cognitive tasks (such as Wechsler's logical memory) are compared with the estimated year from expected symptom onset (EYO) we found no significant differences between men and women. We conclude that in familial AD patients and mouse models, females are protected, and the onset of disease is delayed as long as estrogen levels are intact.",[],Translational psychiatry,2023-04-13,"[{'lastname': 'Kommaddi', 'firstname': 'Reddy Peera', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India. reddy@iisc.ac.in.'}, {'lastname': 'Verma', 'firstname': 'Aditi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Muniz-Terrera', 'firstname': 'Graciela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.\nThe Department of Social Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, 45701, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tiwari', 'firstname': 'Vivek', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Chithanathan', 'firstname': 'Keerthana', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Diwakar', 'firstname': 'Latha', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gowaikar', 'firstname': 'Ruturaj', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Karunakaran', 'firstname': 'Smitha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Malo', 'firstname': 'Palash Kumar', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Graff-Radford', 'firstname': 'Neill R', 'initials': 'NR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic Florida, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, 4500 San Pablo Road S, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Day', 'firstname': 'Gregory S', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic Florida, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, 4500 San Pablo Road S, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Laske', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Munich, Germany.\nSection for Dementia Research, Department of Cellular Neurology, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Vöglein', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.\nGerman Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nübling', 'firstname': 'Georg', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.\nGerman Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ikeuchi', 'firstname': 'Takeshi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Center for Bioresources, Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, 1-757 Asahimachi-dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata City, Niigata, 951-8585, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kasuga', 'firstname': 'Kensaku', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Center for Bioresources, Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, 1-757 Asahimachi-dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata City, Niigata, 951-8585, Japan.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ravindranath', 'firstname': 'Vijayalakshmi', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.\nCentre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.'}]",,,,© 2023.

17,36866579,Sex-specific differences in neuropsychological profiles of mild cognitive impairment in a hospital-based clinical sample.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an etiologically nonspecific diagnosis including a broad spectrum of cognitive decline between normal aging and dementia. Several large-scale cohort studies have found sex effects on neuropsychological test performance in MCI. The primary aim of the current project was to examine sex differences in neuropsychological profiles in a clinically diagnosed MCI sample using clinical and research diagnostic criteria.
The current study includes archival data from 349 patients (age 
Females exhibit worse non-memory domain and test-specific cognitive performances compared to males with otherwise comparable categorical MCI criteria and global cognition measured via screening and composite scores. Analysis of learning curves showed additional sex-specific advantages (visual Males>Females; verbal Females >Males) not captured by MCI subtypes.
Our results highlight sex differences in a clinical sample with MCI. The emphasis of verbal memory in the diagnosis of MCI may result in diagnosis at more advanced stages for females. Additional investigation is needed to determine whether these profiles confer greater risk for progressing to dementia or are confounded by other factors (e.g., delayed referral, medical comorbidities).","['MCI', 'criteria', 'dementia', 'diagnosis', 'female', 'verbal memory']",Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,2023-03-04,"[{'lastname': 'Karstens', 'firstname': 'Aimee J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Mayo Clinic, Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Rochester, MN, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Brown University, Alpert School of Medicine, Department of Psychology, Providence, RI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Maynard', 'firstname': 'Taylor R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychology Program, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.\nNorthwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, Department of Psychology, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tremont', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychology Program, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Brown University, Alpert School of Medicine, Department of Psychology, Providence, RI, USA.'}]",The current study includes archival data from 349 patients (age ,,Females exhibit worse non-memory domain and test-specific cognitive performances compared to males with otherwise comparable categorical MCI criteria and global cognition measured via screening and composite scores.

26344547",Sex differences in grey matter networks in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Sex differences permeate many aspects of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), including epidemiology, pathogenesis, disease progression, and symptom manifestation. However, less is known about potential sex differences in patterns of neurodegeneration in DLB. Here, we test whether grey matter networks also differ between female and male DLB patients. To assess the specificity of these sex differences to DLB, we additionally investigate sex differences in healthy controls (HCs).
A total of 119 (68.7 ± 8.4 years) male and 45 female (69.9 ± 9.1 years) DLB patients from three European centres and the Mayo Clinic were included in this study. Additionally, we included 119 male and 45 female age-matched HCs from the Mayo Clinic. Grey matter volumes of 58 cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, and pontine brain regions derived from structural magnetic resonance images were corrected for age, intracranial volume, and centre. Sex-specific grey matter networks for DLB patients and HCs were constructed by correlating each pair of brain regions. Network properties of the correlation matrices were compared between sexes and groups. Additional analyses were conducted on W-scored data to identify DLB-specific findings.
Networks of male HCs and male DLB patients were characterised by a lower nodal strength compared to their respective female counterparts. In comparison to female HCs, the grey matter networks of male HCs showed a higher global efficiency, modularity, and a lower number of modules. None of the global and nodal network measures showed significant sex differences in DLB.
The disappearance of sex differences in the structural grey matter networks of DLB patients compared to HCs may indicate a sex-dependent network vulnerability to the alpha-synuclein pathology in DLB. Future studies might investigate whether the differences in structural network measures are associated with differences in cognitive scores and clinical symptoms between the sexes.","['dementia with Lewy bodies', 'grey matter networks', 'sex differences']",Research square,2023-02-14,"[{'lastname': 'Habich', 'firstname': 'Annegret', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Oltra', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Medical Psychology Unit, Department of Medicine, Institute of Neurosciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwarz', 'firstname': 'Christopher G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Przybelski', 'firstname': 'Scott A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, US.'}, {'lastname': 'Oppedal', 'firstname': 'Ketil', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Center for Age-Related Medicine, Stavanger University Hospital, Stavanger, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Inguanzo', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Blanc', 'firstname': 'Frédéric', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Day Hospital of Geriatrics, Memory Resource and Research Centre (CM2R) of Strasbourg, Department of Geriatrics, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lemstra', 'firstname': 'Afina W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hort', 'firstname': 'Jakub', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Westman', 'firstname': 'Eric', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Lowe', 'firstname': 'Val J', 'initials': 'VJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Boeve', 'firstname': 'Bradley F', 'initials': 'BF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dierks', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Bern, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Aarsland', 'firstname': 'Dag', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Kantarci', 'firstname': 'Kejal', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferreira', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}]",,,"Networks of male HCs and male DLB patients were characterised by a lower nodal strength compared to their respective female counterparts.

33027276",Sex differences in dementia with Lewy bodies: Focused review of available evidence and future directions.,"In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on sex differences in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) relating to epidemiology, clinical features, neuropathology, biomarkers, disease progression, and caregiving. While many studies show a higher DLB prevalence in men, this finding is inconsistent and varies by study approach. Visual hallucinations may be more common and occur earlier in women with DLB, whereas REM sleep behavior disorder may be more common and occur earlier in men. Several studies report a higher frequency of parkinsonism in men with DLB, while the frequency of fluctuations appears similar between sexes. Women tend to be older, have greater cognitive impairment at their initial visit, and are delayed in meeting DLB criteria compared to men. Women are also more likely to have Lewy body disease with co-existing AD-related pathology than so-called ""pure"" Lewy body disease, while men may present with either. Research is mixed regarding the impact of sex on DLB progression. Biomarker and treatment research assessing for sex differences is lacking. Women provide the majority of caregiving in DLB but how this affects the caregiving experience is uncertain. Gaining a better understanding of sex differences will be instrumental in aiding future development of sex-specific strategies in DLB for early diagnosis, care, and drug development.","['Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy bodies', 'Lewy body disease', 'Sex']",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2023-01-23,"[{'lastname': 'Chiu', 'firstname': 'Shannon Y', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA; Norman Fixel Institute for Neurologic Diseases, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

31691833",Molecular insights into sex-specific metabolic alterations in Alzheimer's mouse brain using multi-omics approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by altered cellular metabolism in the brain. Several of these alterations have been found to be exacerbated in females, known to be disproportionately affected by AD. We aimed to unravel metabolic alterations in AD at the metabolic pathway level and evaluate whether they are sex-specific through integrative metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analysis of mouse brain tissue.
We analyzed male and female triple-transgenic mouse whole brain tissue by untargeted mass spectrometry-based methods to obtain a molecular signature consisting of polar metabolite, complex lipid, and protein data. These data were analyzed using multi-omics factor analysis. Pathway-level alterations were identified through joint pathway enrichment analysis or by separately evaluating lipid ontology and known proteins related to lipid metabolism.
Our analysis revealed significant AD-associated and in part sex-specific alterations across the molecular signature. Sex-dependent alterations were identified in GABA synthesis, arginine biosynthesis, and in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. AD-associated alterations involving lipids were also found in the fatty acid elongation pathway and lysophospholipid metabolism, with a significant sex-specific effect for the latter.
Through multi-omics analysis, we report AD-associated and sex-specific metabolic alterations in the AD brain involving lysophospholipid and amino acid metabolism. These findings contribute to the characterization of the AD phenotype at the molecular level while considering the effect of sex, an overlooked yet determinant metabolic variable.","['3xTg AD mouse', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Amino acids', 'Lipidomics', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Metabolomics', 'Multi-omics', 'Proteomics', 'Sex differences']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2023-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Strefeler', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Unit, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jan', 'firstname': 'Maxime', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Competence Center, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Quadroni', 'firstname': 'Manfredo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Protein Analysis Facility, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Teav', 'firstname': 'Tony', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Unit, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosenberg', 'firstname': 'Nadia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chatton', 'firstname': 'Jean-Yves', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Guex', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Competence Center, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gallart-Ayala', 'firstname': 'Hector', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Unit, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. hector.gallartayala@unil.ch.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivanisevic', 'firstname': 'Julijana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Unit, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. julijana.ivanisevic@unil.ch.'}]",,,"Our analysis revealed significant AD-associated and in part sex-specific alterations across the molecular signature.

21,36617782,Early Mitochondrial Defects in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Mitochondrial (MT) dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β protein precursor and amyloid-β peptides localize to MT and lead to MT dysfunction in familial forms of AD. This dysfunction may trigger subsequent types of pathology.
To identify the MT phenotypes that occur early in order to help understand the cascade of AD pathophysiology.
The 5xFAD mouse model was used to explore the time course of MT pathologies in both sexes. Protein biomarkers for MT dynamics were measured biochemically and MT function was measured using oxygen consumption and ATP assays.
We discovered progressive alterations in mitochondrial dynamics (biogenesis, fission, fusion, and mitophagy) and function (O2 consumption, ATP generation, and Ca2+ import) in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice in both sexes as early as 2 months of age. Thus, mitochondrial dynamics and function become altered at young ages, consistent with an early role for mitochondria in the AD pathological cascade.
Our study offers the baseline information required to understand the hierarchical relationship between the multiple pathologies that develop in this mouse model and provides early biomarkers for MT dysfunction. This will aid in dissecting the temporal cascade of pathologies, understanding sex-specific differences, and in testing the efficacy of putative mitochondrial therapeutics.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'MT dysfunction', 'amyloid-β protein precursor', 'bioenergetics', 'biogenesis', 'fission/fusion', 'mitophagy']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Neelam', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida Scripps Biomedical Research Institute, Jupiter, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Banerjee', 'firstname': 'Rupkatha', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida Scripps Biomedical Research Institute, Jupiter, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Ronald L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida Scripps Biomedical Research Institute, Jupiter, FL, USA.'}]",,"Our study offers the baseline information required to understand the hierarchical relationship between the multiple pathologies that develop in this mouse model and provides early biomarkers for MT dysfunction.

31980607",Precision Exercise Medicine: Sex Specific Differences in Immune and CNS Responses to Physical Activity.,"Physical activity is a powerful lifestyle factor capable of improving cognitive function, modifying the risk for dementia associated with neurodegeneration and possibly slowing neurodegenerative disease progression in both men and women. However, men and women show differences in the biological responses to physical activity and in the vulnerabilities to the onset, progression and outcome of neurodegenerative diseases, prompting the question of whether sex-specific regulatory mechanisms might differentially modulate the benefits of exercise on the brain. Mechanistic studies aimed to better understand how physical activity improves brain health and function suggest that the brain responds to physical exercise by overall reducing neuroinflammation and increasing neuroplasticity. Here, we review the emerging literature considering sex-specific differences in the immune system response to exercise as a potential mechanism by which physical activity affects the brain. Although the literature addressing sex differences in this light is limited, the initial findings suggest a potential influence of biological sex in the brain benefits of exercise, and lay out a scientific foundation to support very much needed studies investigating the potential effects of sex-differences on exercise neurobiology. Considering biological sex and sex-differences in the neurobiological hallmarks of exercise will help to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which physical activity benefits the brain and also improve the development of treatments and interventions for diseases of the central nervous system.",[],"Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2022-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cortes', 'firstname': 'Constanza J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology, School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, USA.\nUAB Nathan Shock Center for the Excellence in the Study of Aging, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.\nUAB Center for Exercise Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.\nUAB Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'De Miguel', 'firstname': 'Zurine', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, California State University, Monterey Bay, CA, USA.'}]",,,,© 2022 – The authors.

33499223","The Landscape of Outpatient Palliative Care in Germany: Results from a Retrospective Analysis of 14,792 Patients.","Palliative care comprises multiprofessional, integrated, person-centered healthcare services for patients and their families facing problems related to progressive or advanced diseases and limited life expectancy. Although non-oncology patients' needs are similar to those of tumor patients, they are often underestimated. The purpose of our study was to investigate the actual utilization of palliative care services in Germany, especially in the outpatient setting.
Using the IQVIA Disease Analyzer database, a total of 14,792 outpatients from 805 primary care practices in Germany with documented palliative care and related diagnosis between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed. Proportions of different diagnoses among patients receiving outpatient palliative care were stratified by gender and different age groups.
The most common underlying diagnosis for outpatient palliative care was cancer (55%), followed by heart failure (16%) and dementia (8%), with age- and sex-specific differences found in the proportion of diagnoses for utilization. While the relative proportions of cancers decreased with age (87% in the 18- to 50-year-old age group versus 37% in the 80-plus age group), the proportion of palliative care related to heart failure increased in the older population (2% in the 18- to 50-year-old age group versus 25% in the 80-plus age group).
This study provides an overview of the situation of outpatient palliative care in Germany and shows age- and gender-specific trends regarding the underlying medical diagnoses. Based on these data, palliative care should be adapted to current demographic developments.","['SAPV', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'heart failure', 'outpatient', 'palliative medicine']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-11-27,"[{'lastname': 'Loosen', 'firstname': 'Sven H', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krieg', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Eschrich', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Luedde', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'KGP Bremerhaven, 27574 Bremerhaven, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krieg', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery (A), University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schallenburger', 'firstname': 'Manuela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Interdisciplinary Center of Palliative Medicine, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwartz', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Interdisciplinary Center of Palliative Medicine, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Neukirchen', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Interdisciplinary Center of Palliative Medicine, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Luedde', 'firstname': 'Tom', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kostev', 'firstname': 'Karel', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology, IQVIA, 60549 Frankfurt, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Roderburg', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}]",,,"The most common underlying diagnosis for outpatient palliative care was cancer (55%), followed by heart failure (16%) and dementia (8%), with age- and sex-specific differences found in the proportion of diagnoses for utilization.

24,36404544,Sex-Specific Heterogeneity of Mild Cognitive Impairment Identified Based on Multi-Modal Data Analysis.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is heterogeneous with different rates and risks of progression to AD. There are significant gender disparities in the susceptibility, prognosis, and outcomes in patients with MCI, with female being disproportionately negatively impacted.
The aim of this study was to identify sex-specific heterogeneity of MCI using multi-modality data and examine the differences in the respective MCI subtypes with different prognostic outcomes or different risks for MCI to AD conversion.
A total of 325 MCI subjects (146 women, 179 men) and 30 relevant features were considered. Mixed-data clustering was applied to women and men separately to discover gender-specific MCI subtypes. Gender differences were compared in the respective subtypes of MCI by examining their MCI to AD disease prognosis, descriptive statistics, and conversion rates.
We identified three MCI subtypes: poor-, good-, and best-prognosis for women and for men, separately. The subtype-wise comparison (for example, poor-prognosis subtype in women versus poor-prognosis subtype in men) showed significantly different means for brain volumetric, cognitive test-related, also for the proportion of comorbidities. Also, there were substantial gender differences in the proportions of participants who reverted to normal function, remained stable, or converted to AD.
Analyzing sex-specific heterogeneity of MCI offers the opportunity to advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of both MCI and AD, allows stratification of risk in clinical trials of interventions, and suggests gender-based early intervention with targeted treatment for patients at risk of developing AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'comorbidity', 'gender differences', 'heterogeneity', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'subtypes']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-11-22,"[{'lastname': 'Katabathula', 'firstname': 'Sreevani', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Pamela B', 'initials': 'PB', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Health Integration, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Rong', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,"Analyzing sex-specific heterogeneity of MCI offers the opportunity to advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of both MCI and AD, allows stratification of risk in clinical trials of interventions, and suggests gender-based early intervention with targeted treatment for patients at risk of developing AD.","We identified three MCI subtypes: poor-, good-, and best-prognosis for women and for men, separately.

30344488",Sex differences in brain functional connectivity of hippocampus in mild cognitive impairment.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Prior research shows that females are more impacted by MCI than males. On average females have a greater incidence rate of any dementia and current evidence suggests that they suffer greater cognitive deterioration than males in the same disease stage. Recent research has linked these sex differences to neuroimaging markers of brain pathology, such as hippocampal volumes. Specifically, the rate of hippocampal atrophy affects the progression of AD in females more than males. This study was designed to extend our understanding of the sex-related differences in the brain of participants with MCI. Specifically, we investigated the difference in the hippocampal connectivity to different areas of the brain.

27291462",Early-life stress elicits peripheral and brain immune activation differently in wild type and 5xFAD mice in a sex-specific manner.,"The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is modulated by genetic and environmental factors. Early-life stress (ELS) exposure during critical periods of brain development can impact later brain function and health, including increasing the risk of developing AD. Microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation have been implicated as playing a role in AD pathology and may be modulated by ELS. To complicate matters further, sex-specific effects have been noted in response to ELS and in the incidence and progression of AD.
Here, we subjected male and female mice with either a wild type or 5xFAD familial AD-model background to maternal separation (MS) from postnatal day 2 to 14 to induce ELS.
We detected hippocampal neuroinflammatory alterations already at postnatal day 15. By 4 months of age, MS mice presented increased immobility time in the forced swim test and a lower discrimination index in the novel object recognition memory test compared to controls. We found altered Bdnf and Arc expression in the hippocampus and increased microglial activation in the prefrontal cortex due to MS in a sex-dependent manner. In 5xFAD mice specifically, MS exacerbated amyloid-beta deposition, particularly in females. In the periphery, the immune cell population was altered by MS exposure.
Overall, our results demonstrate that MS has both short- and long-term effects on brain regions related to memory and on the inflammatory system, both in the brain and periphery. These ELS-related effects that are detectable even in adulthood may exacerbate pathology and increase the risk of developing AD via sex-specific mechanisms.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Early-life stress', 'Immunity', 'Maternal separation', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Sex differences']",Journal of neuroinflammation,2022-06-16,"[{'lastname': 'Bachiller', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Neuroinflammation Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. sbachiller-ibis@us.es.\nClinical Unit of Infectious Diseases, Microbiology and Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine of Sevilla (IBiS), Virgen del Rocío University Hospital, CSIC, University of Sevilla, Seville, Spain. sbachiller-ibis@us.es.'}, {'lastname': 'Hidalgo', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Institution of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia', 'firstname': 'M G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Neuroinflammation Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.\nExperimental Dementia Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Boza-Serrano', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Neuroinflammation Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.\nDepartamento Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Paulus', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Neuroinflammation Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.\nMedical Microspectroscopy, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Denis', 'firstname': 'Q', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Neuroinflammation Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Haikal', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Neural Plasticity and Repair Unit, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Manouchehrian', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Neuroinflammation Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Klementieva', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Medical Microspectroscopy, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'J Y', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Neural Plasticity and Repair Unit, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Pronk', 'firstname': 'C J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Institution of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Gouras', 'firstname': 'G K', 'initials': 'GK', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Dementia Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Deierborg', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Neuroinflammation Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. tomas.deierborg@med.lu.se.'}]",,"Overall, our results demonstrate that MS has both short- and long-term effects on brain regions related to memory and on the inflammatory system, both in the brain and periphery.

29,35483188,Dietary administration of D-chiro-inositol attenuates sex-specific metabolic imbalances in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Increasing evidence shows that hypothalamic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and weight loss precede and progress along with the cognitive decline in sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with sex differences. This study aimed to determine the effect of oral dietary administration of D-Chiro-inositol (DCI), an inositol used against insulin resistance associated with polycystic ovary, on the occurrence of metabolic disorders in the transgenic 5xFAD mouse model of AD (FAD: Family Alzheimer's Disease). DCI was administered from 6 to 10 months of age to male and female 5xFAD mice and control (non-Tg) littermates. Energy balance and multiple metabolic and inflammatory parameters in the hypothalamus, liver and plasma were evaluated to assess the central and peripheral effects of DCI. Results indicated that weight loss and reduced food intake in 5xFAD mice were associated with decreased neuropeptides controlling food intake and the appearance of a pro-inflammatory state in the hypothalamus. Oral administration of DCI partially restored energy balance and hypothalamic parameters, highlighting an increased expression of Npy and Agrp and female-specific downregulation of Gfap and Igf1. DCI also partially normalized impaired insulin signaling and circulating insulin, GLP-1, and GIP deficiencies in 5xFAD mice. Principal component analysis of metabolic parameters indicated the presence of a female-specific fatty liver in 5xFAD mice: DCI administration reversed hepatic fat accumulation, β-oxidation, inflammation and increased GOT and GPT levels. Our study depicts that metabolic impairment along with the cognitive decline in a mouse model of AD, which is exacerbated in females, can be ameliorated by oral supplementation with insulin-sensitizing DCI.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'D-chiro-inositol', 'Fatty liver disease', 'Hypothalamus', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin signaling']",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022-04-29,"[{'lastname': 'López-Gambero', 'firstname': 'Antonio J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de investigación Biomédica de Málaga-IBIMA, 29010 Málaga, Spain; UGC Salud Mental, Hospital Regional Universitario de Málaga, 29010 Málaga, Spain; Universidad de Málaga, Andalucia Tech, Departamento de Biología Celular, Genética y Fisiología, Campus de Teatinos s/n, 29071 Málaga, Spain.

14559362",Predictive metabolic networks reveal sex- and APOE genotype-specific metabolic signatures and drivers for precision medicine in Alzheimer's disease.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by multiple progressive stages, glucose metabolic dysregulation, Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and inexorable cognitive decline. Discovery of metabolic profiles unique to sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and stage of disease progression could provide critical insights for personalized LOAD medicine.
Sex- and APOE-specific metabolic networks were constructed based on changes in 127 metabolites of 656 serum samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort.
Application of an advanced analytical platform identified metabolic drivers and signatures clustered with sex and/or APOE ɛ4, establishing patient-specific biomarkers predictive of disease state that significantly associated with cognitive function. Presence of the APOE ɛ4 shifts metabolic signatures to a phosphatidylcholine-focused profile overriding sex-specific differences in serum metabolites of AD patients.
These findings provide an initial but critical step in developing a diagnostic platform for personalized medicine by integrating metabolomic profiling and cognitive assessments to identify targeted precision therapeutics for AD patient subgroups through computational network modeling.","[""Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative"", 'apolipoprotein E ε4', 'computational systems biology', ""late-onset Alzheimer's disease"", 'metabolic biomarkers', 'metabolic network', 'metabolomics', 'precision medicine', 'sex-specific metabolic changes']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2022-04-29,"[{'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Rui', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nThe Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Trushina', 'firstname': 'Eugenia', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\nDepartment of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Kuixi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nThe Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaidi', 'firstname': 'Syed Shujaat Ali', 'initials': 'SSA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nThe Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lau', 'firstname': 'Branden M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': 'Arizona Research Labs, Genetics Core, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kueider-Paisley', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Moein', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Qianying', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alamprese', 'firstname': 'Melissa L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'The Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vagnerova', 'firstname': 'Barbora', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vijayan', 'firstname': 'Ramachandran', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yanyun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saykin', 'firstname': 'Andrew J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences and the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brinton', 'firstname': 'Roberta D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nThe Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaddurah-Daouk', 'firstname': 'Rima', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.\nDuke Institute of Brain Sciences, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}]",,,"Application of an advanced analytical platform identified metabolic drivers and signatures clustered with sex and/or APOE ɛ4, establishing patient-specific biomarkers predictive of disease state that significantly associated with cognitive function.

26196252",Endogenous and Exogenous Estrogen Exposures: How Women's Reproductive Health Can Drive Brain Aging and Inform Alzheimer's Prevention.,"After advanced age, female sex is the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia affecting over 24 million people worldwide. The prevalence of AD is higher in women than in men, with postmenopausal women accounting for over 60% of all those affected. While most research has focused on gender-combined risk, emerging data indicate sex and gender differences in AD pathophysiology, onset, and progression, which may help account for the higher prevalence in women. Notably, AD-related brain changes develop during a 10-20 year prodromal phase originating in midlife, thus proximate with the hormonal transitions of endocrine aging characteristic of the menopause transition in women. Preclinical evidence for neuroprotective effects of gonadal sex steroid hormones, especially 17β-estradiol, strongly argue for associations between female fertility, reproductive history, and AD risk. The level of gonadal hormones to which the female brain is exposed changes considerably across the lifespan, with relevance to AD risk. However, the neurobiological consequences of hormonal fluctuations, as well as that of hormone therapies, are yet to be fully understood. Epidemiological studies have yielded contrasting results of protective, deleterious and null effects of estrogen exposure on dementia risk. In contrast, brain imaging studies provide encouraging evidence for positive associations between greater cumulative lifetime estrogen exposure and lower AD risk in women, whereas estrogen deprivation is associated with negative consequences on brain structure, function, and biochemistry. Herein, we review the existing literature and evaluate the strength of observed associations between female-specific reproductive health factors and AD risk in women, with a focus on the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposures as a key underlying mechanism. Chief among these variables are reproductive lifespan, menopause status, type of menopause (spontaneous vs. induced), number of pregnancies, and exposure to hormonal therapy, including hormonal contraceptives, hormonal therapy for menopause, and anti-estrogen treatment. As aging is the greatest risk factor for AD followed by female sex, understanding sex-specific biological pathways through which reproductive history modulates brain aging is crucial to inform preventative and therapeutic strategies for AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'hormones', 'menopause', 'reproductive history', 'risk factors', 'sex differences']",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Jett', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Malviya', 'firstname': 'Niharika', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Schelbaum', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Jang', 'firstname': 'Grace', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Jahan', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Clancy', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hristov', 'firstname': 'Hollie', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Pahlajani', 'firstname': 'Silky', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.\nDepartment of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Niotis', 'firstname': 'Kellyann', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Loeb-Zeitlin', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Havryliuk', 'firstname': 'Yelena', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Isaacson', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Brinton', 'firstname': 'Roberta Diaz', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Mosconi', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.\nDepartment of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Jett, Malviya, Schelbaum, Jang, Jahan, Clancy, Hristov, Pahlajani, Niotis, Loeb-Zeitlin, Havryliuk, Isaacson, Brinton and Mosconi.","10.3389/fnagi.2022.831807

25447208",Sex Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Revealed by Free-Water Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Voxel-Based Morphometry.,"Imaging biomarkers are increasingly used in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the identification of sex differences using neuroimaging may provide insight into disease heterogeneity, progression, and therapeutic targets.
The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in grey matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) microstructural disorganization between males and females with AD using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and free-water-corrected diffusion tensor imaging (FW-DTI).
Data were downloaded from the OASIS-3 database, including 158 healthy control (HC; 86 females) and 46 mild AD subjects (24 females). VBM and FW-DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities (AxD and RD, respectively), and FW index) were compared using effect size for the main effects of group, sex, and their interaction.
Significant group and sex differences were observed, with no significant interaction.

34,34791978,Sex differences in predictors for cognitive decline and dementia in people with stroke or transient ischemic attack in the PROGRESS trial.,"Stroke and transient ischemic attack confer greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia.
We used data from the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a blood pressure-lowering randomized controlled trial in stroke/transient ischemic attack. We evaluated overall and sex-specific differences in treatment effects for cognitive decline/dementia, as well as associations with vascular and stroke-specific predictors,considering death as a competing risk.
Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate overall and sex-specific odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence intervals (CI)) for treatment effects and predictors associated with the risk of cognitive decline/dementia, and the women-to-men ratio of odds ratio (RORs).
Over a median four years, 763 cognitive decline/dementia (30.9% women) were recorded in 5888 participants. Women had lower odds of cognitive decline/dementia than men (OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.63-0.95). Active treatment was associated with lower odds of cognitive decline/dementia (0.84, 0.72-0.98), with no evidence of sex difference. Higher education (0.96,0.94-0.98 (per year)) and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) were associated with lower odds of cognitive decline/dementia (0.84,0.82-0.86 (per point higher)). Higher diastolic blood pressure (1.11,1.02-1.20 (per 10 mmHg)), low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m
Several risk factors were associated with cognitive decline/dementia in people with prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, with notable sex differences. Long-term cognitive sequelae of stroke should be considered to strengthen joint prevention strategies for stroke, cognitive decline, and dementia.","['Stroke', 'cognitive decline', 'competing risk', 'dementia', 'sex difference']",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2021-11-19,"[{'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tzourio', 'firstname': 'Christophe', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, Bordeaux University, INSERM, Bordeaux, France.\nHospital Center Bordeaux University, Bordeaux, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Harrap', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Naismith', 'firstname': 'Sharon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.\nBrain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Anderson', 'firstname': 'Craig S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'George Institute China, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.\nNeurology Department, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney Health Partners, Sydney, Australia.\nHeart Health Research Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chalmers', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodward', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.\nGeorge Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}]",,,"Over a median four years, 763 cognitive decline/dementia (30.9% women) were recorded in 5888 participants.

35,34719502,Improving Detection of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment with Sex-Specific Cognitive Norms.,"BackgroundDespite a female advantage in verbal memory, normative data for verbal memory tests used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) often are not sex-adjusted.ObjectiveTo determine whether sex-adjusted norms improve aMCI diagnostic accuracy when accuracy was evaluated by progression to AD dementia over time.MethodsNon-sex-specific and sex-specific verbal memory test norms were incorporated into Jak/Bondi aMCI criteria and applied to older (age 65-90) non-demented women (N = 1,036) and men (N = 355) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Using sex-specific aMCI diagnosis as the ""true"" condition versus non-sex-specific aMCI diagnosis as the ""predicted"" condition, we identified True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives and compared AD dementia risk over 10 years among groups.ResultsRates of aMCI were higher in men versus women (χ2 = 15.39, p < 0.001) when determined based on typical diagnostic criteria, but this difference reversed when using sex-specific diagnostic criteria (χ2 = 8.38, p = 0.004). We identified 8%of women as False Negatives and 12%of men as False Positives. Risk of incident AD dementia in False Positive men was significantly lower than in True Positive men (HR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.12-0.58, p = 0.001). Risk of incident AD dementia in False Negative women was substantially higher than in True Negative women (HR = 3.11, 95%CI = 2.09-4.63, p < 0.001).ConclusionResults suggest that previous reports of higher aMCI rates in men versus women may be an artifact of non-sex-adjusted norms/cut-scores. Incorporation of sex-specific norms/cut-scores for verbal memory impairment into aMCI diagnostic criteria may improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid diagnostic errors in approximately 20%.","['Amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'diagnosis', 'incident Alzheimer’s disease', 'sex differences', 'verbal memory']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-11-02,"[{'lastname': 'Sundermann', 'firstname': 'Erin E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Lisa L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Bondi', 'firstname': 'Mark W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.\nVeterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bennett', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Salmon', 'firstname': 'David P', 'initials': 'DP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Maki', 'firstname': 'Pauline M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychology and OBGYN, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.'}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-215260,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05da828590>

37,34654630,Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease: metabolic reprogramming and therapeutic intervention.,"Studies on the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have revealed three classes of risk factor: age, genetics, and sex. These risk factors point to a metabolic dysregulation as the origin of AD. Adaptive alterations in cerebral metabolism are the rationale for the Metabolic Reprogramming (MR) Theory of the origin of AD. The theory contends that the progression toward AD involves three adaptive events: a hypermetabolic phase, a prolonged prodromal phase, and a metabolic collapse. This article exploits the MR Theory to elucidate the effect of hormonal changes on the origin and progression of AD in women. The theory invokes bioenergetic signatures of the menopausal transition to propose sex-specific diagnostic program and therapeutic strategies.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'brain metabolism', 'estrogen', 'inverse Warburg effect', 'menopausal transition']",Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM,2021-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Demetrius', 'firstname': 'Lloyd A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Eckert', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Basel, Transfaculty Research Platform Molecular and Cognitive Neuroscience, 4002 Basel, Switzerland; Neurobiology Lab for Brain Aging and Mental Health, Psychiatric University Clinics, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Grimm', 'firstname': 'Amandine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Basel, Transfaculty Research Platform Molecular and Cognitive Neuroscience, 4002 Basel, Switzerland; Neurobiology Lab for Brain Aging and Mental Health, Psychiatric University Clinics, 4002 Basel, Switzerland; University of Basel, Life Sciences Training Facility, 4055 Basel, Switzerland.

38,34634288,Sex-specific disruption in corticospinal excitability and hemispheric (a)symmetry in multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which pathophysiology and symptom progression presents differently between the sexes. In a cohort of people with MS (n = 110), we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate sex differences in corticospinal excitability (CSE) and sex-specific relationships between CSE and cognitive function. Although demographics and disease characteristics did not differ between sexes, males were more likely to have cognitive impairment as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); 53.3% compared to females at 26.3%. Greater CSE asymmetry was noted in females compared to males. Females demonstrated higher active motor thresholds and longer silent periods in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand which was more typical of hand dominance patterns in healthy individuals. Males, but not females, exhibited asymmetry of nerve conduction latency (delayed MEP latency in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand). In males, there was also a relationship between delayed onset of ipsilateral silent period (measured in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand) and MoCA, suggestive of cross-callosal disruption. Our findings support that a sex-specific disruption in CSE exists in MS, pointing to interhemispheric disruption as a potential biomarker of cognitive impairment and target for neuromodulating therapies.","['Cognition', 'Corpus callosum', 'Corticospinal excitability', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Sex differences', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation']",Brain research,2021-10-12,"[{'lastname': 'Chaves', 'firstname': 'Arthur R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': ""Recovery and Performance Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, L.A.

19801098",Patterns of hearing changes in women and men from denarians to nonagenarians.,"Hearing loss needs to be diagnosed and treated early, especially in older individuals, since presbycusis potentially increases the risk of depression and dementia. However, standard data on hearing thresholds across the life-span in Japanese individuals are lacking.
In a retrospective consecutive sample of 10681 native-Japanese speakers (37.3% men; 10-99 years; left-right hearing threshold difference of <15 dB for all tested pure tones; free of external, middle, or inner ear disease), we determined standard age-decade and sex-specific pure-tone air-conduction (125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz) hearing threshold norms. The main outcome measures were pure-tone averages for both ears by age-decade and sex.
For participants in their 20s, hearing thresholds at higher frequencies (>1000 Hz) were significantly worse in men than in women. For participants ≥70 years, hearing thresholds at low frequencies were higher in women. Hearing thresholds at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz tended to deteriorate, starting in the teenage years through the 50s, with some decades showing significantly worse decline. Sex differences were absent in the youngest and oldest groups.
Standard age- and sex-specific audiometric data reported here for Japanese individuals over nine age-decades are based on the largest dataset analyzed to date. While hearing thresholds of men and women in the very young and the very old age groups were indistinguishable in their cohorts, patterns of hearing changes for other age cohorts differed by direction and sex.

28025715",Alzheimer's pathogenic mechanisms and underlying sex difference.,"AD is a neurodegenerative disease, and its frequency is often reported to be higher for women than men: almost two-thirds of patients with AD are women. One prevailing view is that women live longer than men on average of 4.5 years, plus there are more women aged 85 years or older than men in most global subpopulations; and older age is the greatest risk factor for AD. However, the differences in the actual risk of developing AD for men and women of the same age is difficult to assess, and the findings have been mixed. An increasing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies as well as the complications in estimating incidence support the sex-specific biological mechanisms in diverging AD risk as an important adjunct explanation to the epidemiologic perspective. Although some of the sex differences in AD prevalence are due to differences in longevity, other distinct biological mechanisms increase the risk and progression of AD in women. These risk factors include (1) deviations in brain structure and biomarkers, (2) psychosocial stress responses, (3) pregnancy, menopause, and sex hormones, (4) genetic background (i.e., APOE), (5) inflammation, gliosis, and immune module (i.e., TREM2), and (6) vascular disorders. More studies focusing on the underlying biological mechanisms for this phenomenon are needed to better understand AD. This review presents the most recent data in sex differences in AD-the gateway to precision medicine, therefore, shaping expert perspectives, inspiring researchers to go in new directions, and driving development of future diagnostic tools and treatments for AD in a more customized way.","['Aging', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Estrogen', 'Gender difference', 'Hormones', 'Menopause']",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2021-04-13,"[{'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Donghui', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.

25730862",Sex-specific alterations in NAD+ metabolism in 3xTg Alzheimer's disease mouse brain assessed by quantitative targeted LC-MS.,"Levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) are known to decline with age and have been associated with impaired mitochondrial function leading to neurodegeneration, a key facet of Alzheimer's disease (AD). NAD+synthesis is sustained via tryptophan-kynurenine (Trp-Kyn) pathway as de novo synthesis route, and salvage pathways dependent on the availability of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. While being currently investigated as a multifactorial disease with a strong metabolic component, AD remains without curative treatment and important sex differences were reported in relation to disease onset and progression. The aim of this study was to reveal the potential deregulation of NAD+metabolism in AD with the direct analysis of NAD+precursors in the mouse brain tissue (wild type (WT) versus triple transgenic (3xTg) AD), using a sex-balanced design. To this end, we developed a quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, which allowed for the measurement of the full spectrum of NAD+precursors and intermediates in all three pathways. In brain tissue of mice with developed AD symptoms, a decrease in kynurenine (Kyn) versus increase in kynurenic acid (KA) levels were observed in both sexes with a significantly higher increment of KA in males. These alterations in Trp-Kyn pathway might be a consequence of neuroinflammation and a compensatory production of neuroprotective kynurenic acid. In the NAD+ salvage pathway, significantly lower levels of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) were measured in the AD brain of males and females. Depletion of NMN implies the deregulation of salvage pathway critical for maintaining optimal NAD+ levels and mitochondrial and neuronal function.","['3xTg AD mouse model', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'LC-MS', 'NAD+ metabolism', 'brain', 'targeted metabolomics']",Journal of neurochemistry,2021-04-09,"[{'lastname': 'van der Velpen', 'firstname': 'Vera', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Platform, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosenberg', 'firstname': 'Nadia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Maillard', 'firstname': 'Vanille', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Platform, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Teav', 'firstname': 'Tony', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Platform, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chatton', 'firstname': 'Jean-Yves', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gallart-Ayala', 'firstname': 'Hector', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Platform, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivanisevic', 'firstname': 'Julijana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Metabolomics Platform, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}]",,,,© 2021 The Authors.

42,33323410,Aβ oligomers induce pathophysiological mGluR5 signaling in Alzheimer's disease model mice in a sex-selective manner.,"The prevalence, presentation, and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) differ between men and women, although β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition is a pathological hallmark of AD in both sexes. Aβ-induced activation of the neuronal glutamate receptor mGluR5 is linked to AD progression. However, we found that mGluR5 exhibits distinct sex-dependent profiles. Specifically, mGluR5 isolated from male mouse cortical and hippocampal tissues bound with high affinity to Aβ oligomers, whereas mGluR5 from female mice exhibited no such affinity. This sex-selective Aβ-mGluR5 interaction did not appear to depend on estrogen, but rather Aβ interaction with cellular prion protein (PrP",[],Science signaling,2020-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'Abd-Elrahman', 'firstname': 'Khaled S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, Alexandria 21521, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Albaker', 'firstname': 'Awatif', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 12371, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'de Souza', 'firstname': 'Jessica M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Immunology, ICB, Universidade Federalde Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 31270-901, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ribeiro', 'firstname': 'Fabiola M', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, ICB, Universidade Federalde Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 31270-901, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Schlossmacher', 'firstname': 'Michael G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nNeuroscience Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tiberi', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nNeuroscience Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamilton', 'firstname': 'Alison', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.\nDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferguson', 'firstname': 'Stephen S G', 'initials': 'SSG', 'affiliation': 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada. sferguso@uottawa.ca.\nDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

29907423",Sex-Dependent Molecular Mechanisms of Lipotoxic Injury in Brain Microvasculature: Implications for Dementia.,"Cardiovascular risk factors and biologic sex play a role in vascular dementia which is characterized by progressive reduction in cognitive function and memory. Yet, we lack understanding about the role sex plays in the molecular mechanisms whereby lipid stress contributes to cognitive decline. Five-week-old low-density lipoprotein deficient (LDL-R -/-) male and female mice and C57BL/6J wild types (WT) were fed a control or Western Diet for 8 weeks. Differential expression of protein coding and non-protein coding genes (DEG) were determined in laser captured hippocampal microvessels using genome-wide microarray, followed by bioinformatic analysis of gene networks, pathways, transcription factors and sex/gender-based analysis (SGBA). Cognitive function was assessed by Y-maze. Bioinformatic analysis revealed more DEGs in females (2412) compared to males (1972). Hierarchical clusters revealed distinctly different sex-specific gene expression profiles irrespective of diet and genotype. There were also fewer and different biologic responses in males compared to females, as well as different cellular pathways and gene networks (favoring greater neuroprotection in females), together with sex-specific transcription factors and non-protein coding RNAs. Hyperlipidemic stress also resulted in less severe cognitive dysfunction in females. This sex-specific pattern of differential hippocampal microvascular RNA expression might provide therapeutic targets for dementia in males and females.","['brain microvasculature', 'cognitive function', 'multi-genomics', 'sex difference', 'western diet']",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-11-05,"[{'lastname': 'Nuthikattu', 'firstname': 'Saivageethi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Milenkovic', 'firstname': 'Dragan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.\nUniversité Clermont Auvergne, INRA, UNH, CRNH Auvergne, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Rutledge', 'firstname': 'John C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Villablanca', 'firstname': 'Amparo C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms21218146

32900766",Sex differences in clinical phenotype and transitions of care among individuals dying of COVID-19 in Italy.,"Among the unknowns posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the role of biological sex to explain disease susceptibility and progression is still a matter of debate, with limited sex-disaggregated data available.
A retrospective analysis was performed to assess if sex differences exist in the clinical manifestations and transitions of care among hospitalized individuals dying with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (February 27-June 11, 2020). Clinical characteristics and the times from symptoms' onset to admission, nasopharyngeal swab, and death were compared between sexes. Adjusted multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinical features associated with male sex.
Of the 32,938 COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in Italy, 3517 hospitalized and deceased individuals with COVID-19 (mean 78 ± 12 years, 33% women) were analyzed. At admission, men had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (adj-OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adj-OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.29-2.27), and chronic kidney disease (adj-OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.96), while women were older and more likely to have dementia (adj-OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.95) and autoimmune diseases (adj-OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), yet both sexes had a high level of multimorbidity. The times from symptoms' onset to admission and nasopharyngeal swab were slightly longer in men despite a typical acute respiratory illness with more frequent fever at the onset. Men received more often experimental therapy (adj-OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.45-5.74) and experienced more likely acute kidney injury (adj-OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.90).
Men and women dying with COVID-19 had different clinical manifestations and transitions of care. Identifying sex-specific features in individuals with COVID-19 and fatal outcome might inform preventive strategies.","['COVID-19', 'Comorbidities', 'In-hospital complications', 'Sex', 'Transition of care']",Biology of sex differences,2020-10-18,"[{'lastname': 'Raparelli', 'firstname': 'Valeria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161, Rome, Italy. valeria.raparelli@uniroma1.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Palmieri', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular, Endocrine-metabolic Diseases and Aging, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Via Giano della Bella, 34, 00161, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Canevelli', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Via Giano della Bella, 34, 00161, Rome, Italy.\nDepartment of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pricci', 'firstname': 'Flavia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular, Endocrine-metabolic Diseases and Aging, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Via Giano della Bella, 34, 00161, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Unim', 'firstname': 'Brigid', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular, Endocrine-metabolic Diseases and Aging, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Via Giano della Bella, 34, 00161, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lo Noce', 'firstname': 'Cinzia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular, Endocrine-metabolic Diseases and Aging, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Via Giano della Bella, 34, 00161, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Villani', 'firstname': 'Emanuele R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Largo Francesco Vito, 1, 00168, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rochon', 'firstname': 'Paula A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': ""Women's College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, University of Toronto, 76 Grenville St, Toronto, ON, M5G 1N8, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Pilote', 'firstname': 'Louise', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, 1001 boul.

45,33008530,"Sex difference in Alzheimer's disease: An updated, balanced and emerging perspective on differing vulnerabilities.","Sex biology influences Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sex differences exist in the epidemiologic, imaging, biomarker, and pathology studies of this uniquely human condition. The mandate to understand sex differences in major diseases like AD is important for many reasons. First, AD is the most common neurodegenerative condition and a devastating disease-experienced as an insidious and progressive erosion of memory, cognition, and other brain functions. Second, since true sex differences in AD exist, their precise understanding could reveal what protects one sex or makes the other vulnerable-and this knowledge could inform development of new therapeutic approaches to benefit both sexes. Third, AD develops in the aging brain in a milieu of decreased circulating gonadal hormones. Thus, how sex-specific depletion affects the brain along with how replacement of androgens in men and estrogens and progestins in women alters vulnerability to AD are relevant questions, with clinical implications in a future of personalized medicine. This review will highlight advances in sex differences in AD in human populations with a focused perspective on epidemiology, biomarkers, and clinical trials. A thorough and concise overview of sex differences reviewed here indicates varying vulnerabilities in men and women. This review examines several lines of recent and strong evidence that collectively indicate the following: (1) men die faster with AD, (2) more women live with AD, (3) both sexes show similar risk of developing AD until advanced ages when women show increased risk, (4) both sexes show largely similar AD biomarker burden with notable exceptions for higher tau levels in subgroups of women with high amyloid, (5) women show brain reserve and resilience to tau pathology, (6) both sexes are vulnerable to the genetic risk of carrying APOE4, with women showing higher risk, and (7) neither sex has shown clear benefit of hormone replacement for AD or dementia risk in randomized clinical trials to date.","['Aging', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Androgen', 'Biomarkers', 'Dementia', 'Estrogen', 'Gender', 'Sex', 'Sex difference', 'Testosterone']",Handbook of clinical neurology,2020-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Dubal', 'firstname': 'Dena B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Endowed Chair in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.

32091549",Examining Sex Differences in Markers of Cognition and Neurodegeneration in Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease: Preliminary Findings from the Colombian Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Biomarker Study.,"Growing evidence suggests that there may be a sex-specific biological risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with autosomal dominant AD due to a mutation (E280A) in Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) are genetically determined to develop early-onset dementia and thus, have few age-related risk factors for AD that are known to vary by sex (i.e., cardiovascular disease, menopause, life expectancy).
Investigate sex differences in markers of cognition and neurodegeneration in autosomal dominant AD.
We conducted a retrospective study in 19 cognitively-unimpaired PSEN1 mutation carriers (age range 20-44; 11 females), 11 symptomatic carriers (age range 42-56; 8 females), and 23 matched non-carriers family members (age range 20-50; 13 females). We examined hippocampal volume ratio, CERAD Total Score, and CERAD Word List (i.e., Learning, Delayed Recall, and Recognition). Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlations and regression models were conducted.
There were no differential associations between age, CERAD Total Score, CERAD Word List-Learning, Delayed Recall, Recognition, and hippocampal volume ratio in male and female carriers and non-carriers. Cognitively-unimpaired female carriers showed better CERAD Total scores and CERAD Word List-Learning than cognitively-unimpaired male carriers, despite having similar hippocampal volume ratios. The interaction of sex and hippocampal volume ratio did not predict cognitive performance across groups.
Our preliminary findings suggest that cognitively-unimpaired female carriers showed a verbal memory reserve, and as disease progresses, female carriers did not exhibit a cognitive susceptibility to AD-related neurodegeneration. Future studies with larger samples of autosomal dominant AD are warranted to further understand sex differences in AD-related clinical and pathological markers.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'atrophy', 'cognition', 'familial Alzheimer’s disease', 'memory', 'sex']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-09-15,"[{'lastname': 'Vila-Castelar', 'firstname': 'Clara', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Guzmán-Vélez', 'firstname': 'Edmarie', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pardilla-Delgado', 'firstname': 'Enmanuelle', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Buckley', 'firstname': 'Rachel F', 'initials': 'RF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bocanegra', 'firstname': 'Yamile', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Baena', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fox-Fuller', 'firstname': 'Joshua T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.\nDepartment of Psychological & Brain Sciences, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tirado', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Muñoz', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Giraldo', 'firstname': 'Margarita', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Acosta-Baena', 'firstname': 'Natalia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rios-Romenets', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Langbaum', 'firstname': 'Jessica B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': ""Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Tariot', 'firstname': 'Pierre N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': ""Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Lopera', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Reiman', 'firstname': 'Eric M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': ""Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Quiroz', 'firstname': 'Yakeel T', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.\nGrupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}]",,"Our preliminary findings suggest that cognitively-unimpaired female carriers showed a verbal memory reserve, and as disease progresses, female carriers did not exhibit a cognitive susceptibility to AD-related neurodegeneration.

47,32651319,Sex Differences of Longitudinal Brain Changes in Cognitively Unimpaired Adults.,"There is increasing evidence that AD progression differs by sex.
The aim of this work was to determine sex differences in the association of baseline levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau, YKL-40, sTREM2) with longitudinal brain changes in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults.
This pilot study included 36 CU subjects (age 66.5±5.5, 12 male) scanned twice, two years apart. Using a voxel-wise analysis, we determined the sex differences in the association maps between CSF biomarkers and atrophy rates.
We did not find differences related to Aβ42. We found a greater impact of the rest of CSF biomarkers in areas of the Papez circuit in women versus men. Men showed greater involvement in lateral parietal and paracentral areas.

48,31985459,Sex-Specific Associations Between Depressive Symptoms and Risk for Subsequent Dementia.,"An association between depression and an increased risk for subsequent dementia is well-established. Sexspecific associations are understudied yet.
We aimed to investigate sex-specific associations between depressive symptoms and dementia risk.
Longitudinal analyses were conducted in a pooled data set (n = 4,255, mean age = 80 years) of two prospective cohort studies (LEILA 75+, AgeCoDe). Depressive symptoms were harmonized by dichotomized scores of two different depression screening scales using established cutoffs. Transition to dementia was used as outcome in Cox proportional hazards models.
Depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with an increased risk for subsequent dementia, and this association was more pronounced in males (interaction of depressive symptoms × sex: HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.64, p = 0.042) in a model adjusted for study, age, and education. After additional adjustment for subjective and objective cognition, depressive symptoms and their interaction with sex (HR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.85-2.23, p = 0.188) were no longer significantly associated with the risk for subsequent dementia. Sex-stratified analyses showed stronger and significant associations between depressive symptoms and subsequent dementia in men (e.g., HR= 2.10, 95% CI: 1.36-3.23, p = 0.001, compared to HR= 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.58, p = 0.020, in women).
Overall, we provide evidence for a stronger association between depression and dementia in men compared to women. Depressive symptoms should be diagnosed, monitored, and treated, not only due to depression, but also with respect to the risk for subsequent dementia, especially in elderly men.","['Dementia', 'depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'gender', 'sex']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Heser', 'firstname': 'Kathrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kleineidam', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Pabst', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiese', 'firstname': 'Birgitt', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Institute of General Practice, Working Group Medical Statistics and IT Infrastructure, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Roehr', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Löbner', 'firstname': 'Margrit', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hajek', 'firstname': 'André', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Economics and Health Services Research, Hamburg Center for Health Economics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Leeden', 'firstname': 'Carolin', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Primary Medical Care, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Angermeyer', 'firstname': 'Matthias C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Center for Public Mental Health, Gösing am Wagram, Austria.\nDipartimento di Sanità Pubblica, Università degli Studi di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Scherer', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Primary Medical Care, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'König', 'firstname': 'Hans-Helmut', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Economics and Health Services Research, Hamburg Center for Health Economics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Maier', 'firstname': 'Wolfgang', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Riedel-Heller', 'firstname': 'Steffi G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagner', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.\nDZNE, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany.'}]",,,"Depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with an increased risk for subsequent dementia, and this association was more pronounced in males (interaction of depressive symptoms × sex: HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.64, p = 0.042) in a model adjusted for study, age, and education.

49,31658056,Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Old Age: A Sex-Specific Cytokinome Signature.,"Elevated peripheral levels of different cytokines and chemokines in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as compared with healthy controls (HC), have emphasized the role of inflammation in such a disease. Considering the cross-talking between the central nervous system and the periphery, the inflammatory analytes may provide utility as biomarkers to identify AD at earlier stages.
Using an advanced statistical approach, we can discriminate the interactive network of cytokines/chemokines and propose a useful tool to follow the progression and evolution of AD, also in light of sex differences.
A cohort of 289 old-age subjects was screened for cytokine and chemokine profiling, measured in plasma, after a thorough clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. A custom algorithm based on Fisher linear discriminant analysis was applied to ascertain a classification signature able to discriminate HC from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
We observed that a joint expression of three proteins (a ""signature"" composed by IFN-α2, IL-1α, TNFα) can discriminate HC from AD with an accuracy of 65.24%. Using this signature on MCI samples, 84.93% of them were classified as ""non-HC"". Stratifying MCI samples by sex, we observed that 87.23% of women were classified as ""non-HC"", and only 57.69% of males. Indeed, in a scatter plot of IFN-α2 and IL-1α, the HC group was better separated from MCI and AD in women as compared with men.
These findings suggest that AD is accompanied by a peripheral inflammatory response that can already be present in MCI subjects, thus providing a mean for detecting this at-risk status and allow an anticipated intervention.","['Cytokines', 'dementia', 'inflammation', 'markers', 'sex']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Boccardi', 'firstname': 'Virginia', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Paolacci', 'firstname': 'Lucia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Remondini', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Bologna, and INFN Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Giampieri', 'firstname': 'Enrico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Bologna, and INFN Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Poli', 'firstname': 'Giulia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Terni, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Curti', 'firstname': 'Nico', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Bologna, and INFN Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cecchetti', 'firstname': 'Roberta', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Villa', 'firstname': 'Alfredo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pathology, S.M. della Misericordia Hospital, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruggiero', 'firstname': 'Carmelinda', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Brancorsini', 'firstname': 'Stefano', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Terni, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mecocci', 'firstname': 'Patrizia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.'}]",,"These findings suggest that AD is accompanied by a peripheral inflammatory response that can already be present in MCI subjects, thus providing a mean for detecting this at-risk status and allow an anticipated intervention.","We observed that a joint expression of three proteins (a ""signature"" composed by IFN-α2, IL-1α, TNFα) can discriminate HC from AD with an accuracy of 65.24%.

28928740",Sex-specific hippocampal metabolic signatures at the onset of systemic inflammation with lipopolysaccharide in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Systemic inflammation enhances the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent pro-inflammatory endotoxin produced by the gut, is found in excess levels in AD where it associates with neurological hallmarks of pathology. Sex differences in susceptibility to inflammation and AD progression have been reported, but how this impacts on LPS responses remains under investigated. We previously reported in an APP/PS1 model of AD that systemic LPS administration rapidly altered hippocampal metabolism in males. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to comprehensively identify hippocampal metabolic processes occurring at onset of systemic inflammation with LPS (100 µg/kg, i.v.) in APP/PS1 mice, at an early pathological stage, and investigated the sexual dimorphism in this response. Four hours after LPS administration, pathways regulating energy metabolism, immune and oxidative stress responses were simultaneously recruited in the hippocampi of 4.5-month-old mice with a more protective response in females despite their pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant metabolic signature in the absence of immune stimulation. LPS induced comparable behavioural sickness responses in male and female wild-type and APP/PS1 mice and comparable activation of both the serotonin and nicotinamide pathways of tryptophan metabolism in their hippocampi. Elevations in N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, a major toxic metabolite of nicotinamide, correlated with behavioural sickness regardless of sex, as well as with the LPS-induced hypothermia seen in males. Males also exhibited a pro-inflammatory-like downregulation of pyruvate metabolism, exacerbated in APP/PS1 males, and methionine metabolism whereas females showed a greater cytokine response and anti-inflammatory-like downregulation of hippocampal methylglyoxal and methionine metabolism. Metabolic changes were not associated with morphological markers of immune cell activation suggesting that they constitute an early event in the development of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and AD exacerbation. These data suggest that the female hippocampus is more tolerant to acute systemic inflammation.","['APP/PS1 mouse model', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Hippocampus', 'Inflammation', 'Lipopolysaccharide', 'Metabolomics', 'Methionine', 'Microglia', 'Serotonin', 'Sex differences']","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019-09-29,"[{'lastname': 'Agostini', 'firstname': 'Alessandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Division of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Medical School, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuchun', 'firstname': 'Ding', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Computer Sciences, University of Nottingham, Jubilee Campus, Wollaton Road, Nottingham NG8 1BB, UK; School of Computing Science, Urban Sciences Building, Newcastle University, 1 Science Square, Science Central, Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 5TG, UK(1).'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Bai', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Computing Science, Urban Sciences Building, Newcastle University, 1 Science Square, Science Central, Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 5TG, UK(1).'}, {'lastname': 'Kendall', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Division of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Medical School, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Pardon', 'firstname': 'Marie-Christine', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Division of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Medical School, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK.

26005850",Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease: Understanding the molecular impact.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that presents with cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbance. Approximately 5.5 million people in the United States live with AD, most of whom are over the age of 65 with two-thirds being woman. There have been major advancements over the last decade or so in the understanding of AD neuropathological changes and genetic involvement. However, studies of sex impact in AD have not been adequately integrated into the investigation of disease development and progression. It becomes indispensable to acknowledge in both basic science and clinical research studies the importance of understanding sex-specific differences in AD pathophysiology and pathogenesis, which could guide future effort in the discovery of novel targets for AD. Here, we review the latest and most relevant literature on this topic, highlighting the importance of understanding sex dimorphism from a molecular perspective and its association to clinical trial design and development in AD research field.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Molecular impact', 'Pathogenesis', 'Risk factors', 'Sex differences']",Brain research,2019-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Toro', 'firstname': 'Carlos A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'National Center for the Medical Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury, James J Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10468, United States; Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, United States.

52,31127762,Women Outperform Men in Verbal Episodic Memory Even in Oldest-Old Age: 13-Year Longitudinal Results of the AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe Study.,"Sex differences in verbal episodic memory function have been widely reported. However, sex-specific effects on rates of episodic memory decline remain controversial, and evidence is particularly scarce in the oldest-old population.
We aimed to investigate sex differences in trajectories of episodic memory performance in oldest-old individuals.
Based on 13-year longitudinal data with 9 follow-up assessments of a large sample of cognitively unimpaired old (75+) primary care patients (n = 3,254) participating in the German AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe study, we used linear mixed effects analyses to model sex-specific trajectories of change in verbal episodic memory while accounting for covarying factors.
We found that even in the highest age group women outperformed men in immediate (b = -1.71, p < 0.001) and delayed (b = -0.85, p < 0.001) free recall conditions. Associated late-life trajectories, however, did not differ significantly between the sexes. We further demonstrated that younger age, higher education, and an absence of depressive symptoms predicted better performance in both sexes. In contrast, past occurrences of stroke and APOE ɛ4 carrier status showed a negative relation to test scores.
Our findings confirm previous research suggesting that women perform better in verbal episodic memory tests. We add that this advantage is still present in the oldest-old age groups. Our results indicate that sociodemographic and health related factors are as important as genetically based APOE ɛ4 carrier status in the prediction of normal cognitive development in advanced old age.","['Cognition', 'cohort study', 'longitudinal', 'oldest-old', 'sex differences', 'verbal episodic memory\n']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Golchert', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health (ISAP), University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Roehr', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health (ISAP), University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.\nLIFE - Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Luck', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Economic and Social Sciences & Institute of Social Medicine, Rehabilitation Sciences and Healthcare Research (ISRV), University of Applied Sciences Nordhausen, Nordhausen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagner', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.\nDZNE, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuchs', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of General Practice, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiese', 'firstname': 'Birgitt', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Work Group Medical Statistics and IT-Infrastructure, Institute for General Practice, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'van den Bussche', 'firstname': 'Hendrik', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Medical Care, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, University Medical Center, Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Brettschneider', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Economics and Health Services Research, Hamburg Center for Health Economics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Werle', 'firstname': 'Jochen', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim/Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bickel', 'firstname': 'Horst', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Pentzek', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of General Practice, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Oey', 'firstname': 'Anke', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Work Group Medical Statistics and IT-Infrastructure, Institute for General Practice, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Eisele', 'firstname': 'Marion', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Medical Care, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, University Medical Center, Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'König', 'firstname': 'Hans-Helmut', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Economics and Health Services Research, Hamburg Center for Health Economics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Weyerer', 'firstname': 'Siegfried', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim/Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mösch', 'firstname': 'Edelgard', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Maier', 'firstname': 'Wolfgang', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.\nDZNE, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Scherer', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Medical Care, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, University Medical Center, Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heser', 'firstname': 'Kathrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.\nJoint last authors.'}, {'lastname': 'Riedel-Heller', 'firstname': 'Steffi G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health (ISAP), University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.\nJoint last authors.'}]",,Our findings confirm previous research suggesting that women perform better in verbal episodic memory tests.

29033943",Sex-specific neurogenic deficits and neurocognitive disorders in middle-aged HIV-1 Tg26 transgenic mice.,"Varying degrees of cognitive deficits affect over half of all HIV-1 infected patients. Because of antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens, the HIV-1 patient population is increasing in age. Very few epidemiological studies have focused on sex-specific differences in HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The purpose of this study is to examine any possible differences between male and female mice in the progression of cognitive dementia during persistent low-level HIV-1 protein exposure, mimicking the typical clinical setting in the post-ART era. Eight to ten-month old HIV-1 Tg26(+/-) transgenic mice were utilized to assess for specific learning and memory modalities. Initial physiological screening and fear conditioning assessments revealed that Tg26 mice exhibited no significant differences in general behavioral function, contextual fear conditioning, or cued fear conditioning responses when compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates, regardless of sex. However, Barnes maze testing revealed significantly impaired short and long-term spatial memory in males, while females had impaired spatial learning abilities and short-term spatial memory. The potential cellular mechanism underlying these sex-specific neurocognitive deficits was explored with hippocampal neurogenic analysis. Compared to WT mice, both male and female Tg26(+/-) mice had fewer quiescent neural stem cells and neuroblasts in their hippocampi. Male Tg26(+/-) mice had a more robust reduction of the quiescent neural stem cell pool than female Tg26(+/-) mice. While female WT mice had a higher number of neural progenitor cells than male WT mice, only female Tg26(+/-) mice exhibited a robust reduction in the number of neural progenitor cells. Altogether, these results suggest that middle-aged male and female Tg26(+/-) mice manifest differing impairments in cognitive functioning and hippocampal neurogenesis. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding sex related differences in HAND pathology, which would aid in designing more optimized therapeutic regimens for the treatment of HAND.","['Barnes maze', 'Biological sex', 'Differentiation', 'Fear conditioning', 'HAND', 'HIV-1', 'Neural stem cells', 'Neurogenesis', 'Tg26 mouse']","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019-04-19,"[{'lastname': 'Putatunda', 'firstname': 'Raj', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yonggang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Fang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Fagan', 'firstname': 'Philip Regis', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Huaqing', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Science, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramirez', 'firstname': 'Servio H', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Praticò', 'firstname': 'Domenico', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Alzheimer's Center at Temple, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.""}, {'lastname': 'Barbe', 'firstname': 'Mary F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Wenhui', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, 3500 N Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, United States.

54,30959072,Impact of sex differences and gender specificity on behavioral characteristics and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders.,"The impact of neurodegenerative disorders in humans has multiple consequences because of the progressive decline in cognitive and physical performances. These disorders have diverse manifestations and are influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors, concurrent health conditions as well as un-modifiable predisposing risk factors, including gender and advanced age. Accumulating evidence indicates a gender-dependent natural bias of neurodegenerative diseases, such as, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis, with the ratio of male to female prevalence as well as the severity of the disease differing significantly between the two sexes. This observation has recently garnered much attention and it is now being realized that understanding the sex as a biological variable in the etiology of the neurodegenerative diseases may advance the status of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies while improving the associated decline in cognitive and functional abilities. This review highlights the influence of gender in neurodegenerative disorders and further discusses the sex-specific pre-determined microenvironments that are critical in predisposing the individuals to such disorders.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Cognitive impairment', 'Gender bias', 'Huntington’s disease', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative disorders', ""Parkinson's disease""]",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019-04-09,"[{'lastname': 'Ullah', 'firstname': 'Mohammad Fahad', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Prince Fahd Research Chair, Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Tabuk, 71491, Saudi Arabia.

11739814",Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Risk Factors for Dementia.,"Dementia, characterized by a progressive cognitive decline and a cumulative inability to behave independently, is highly associated with other diseases. Various cardiovascular disorders, such as coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, are well-known risk factors for dementia. Currently, increasing evidence suggests that sex factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases, including cardiovascular disease and dementia. Recent studies show that nearly two-thirds of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are women; however, the incidence difference between men and women remains vague. Therefore, studies are needed to investigate sex-specific differences, which can help understand the pathophysiology of dementia and identify potential therapeutic targets for both sexes. In the present review, we summarize sex differences in the prevalence and incidence of dementia by subtypes. This review also describes sex differences in the risk factors of dementia and examines the impact of risk factors on the incidence of dementia in both sexes.","['Cardiovascular risk factors', 'Dementia incidence', 'Dementia prevalence', 'Sex difference']",Biomolecules & therapeutics,2018-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Mi-Young', 'initials': 'MY', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Kyeongjin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'Chang Hyung', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.\nInstitute on Aging, Ajou University Medical Center, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Sang Yoon', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chronic Inflammatory Disease Research Center, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Yi-Sook', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.\nResearch Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.'}]",,,,,"10.4062/biomolther.2018.159

56,29985474,Sex differences in Alzheimer disease - the gateway to precision medicine.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by wide heterogeneity in cognitive and behavioural syndromes, risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. Addressing this phenotypic variation will be crucial for the development of precise and effective therapeutics in AD. Sex-related differences in neural anatomy and function are starting to emerge, and sex might constitute an important factor for AD patient stratification and personalized treatment. Although the effects of sex on AD epidemiology are currently the subject of intense investigation, the notion of sex-specific clinicopathological AD phenotypes is largely unexplored. In this Review, we critically discuss the evidence for sex-related differences in AD symptomatology, progression, biomarkers, risk factor profiles and treatment. The cumulative evidence reviewed indicates sex-specific patterns of disease manifestation as well as sex differences in the rates of cognitive decline and brain atrophy, suggesting that sex is a crucial variable in disease heterogeneity. We discuss critical challenges and knowledge gaps in our current understanding. Elucidating sex differences in disease phenotypes will be instrumental in the development of a 'precision medicine' approach in AD, encompassing individual, multimodal, biomarker-driven and sex-sensitive strategies for prevention, detection, drug development and treatment.",[],Nature reviews.

We analyzed sex-specific effects on Aβ-positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein, and rates of change on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5 across three cohorts, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle, and Harvard Aging Brain Study (n = 755; clinical dementia rating = 0; age (standard deviation) = 73.6 (6.5); female = 55%). Mixed-effects models of cognitive change by sex, Aβ-positron emission tomography, and apolipoprotein ε4 were examined with quadratic time effects over a median of 4 years of follow-up.
Apolipoprotein ε4 prevalence and Aβ burden did not differ by sex. Sex did not directly influence cognitive decline. Females with higher Aβ exhibited faster decline than males. Post hoc contrasts suggested that females who were Aβ and apolipoprotein ε4 positive declined faster than their male counterparts.

11796757",Sexual dimorphism in predisposition to Alzheimer's disease.,"Clinical studies indicate that Alzheimer's disease (AD) disproportionately affects women in both disease prevalence and rate of symptom progression, but the mechanisms underlying this sexual divergence are unknown. Although some have suggested this difference in risk is a reflection of the known differences in longevity between men and women, mounting clinical and preclinical evidence supports women also having intrinsic susceptibilities toward the disease. Although a number of potential risk factors have been hypothesized to mediate these differences, none have been definitively verified. In this review, we first summarize the epidemiologic studies of prevalence and incidence of AD among the sexes. Next, we discuss the most likely risk factors to date that interact with biological sex, including (1) genetic factors, (2) sex hormones (3) deviations in brain structure, (4) inflammation and microglia, and (5) and psychosocial stress responses. Overall, though differences in life span are likely to account for part of the divide between the sexes in AD prevalence, the abundance of preclinical and clinical evidence presented here suggests an increase in intrinsic AD risk for women. Therefore, future studies focusing on the underlying biological mechanisms for this phenomenon are needed to better understand AD pathogenesis in both sexes, with the eventual goal of sex-specific prevention and treatment strategies.","['APOE', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Brain structure', 'Cognition', 'Hormones', 'Sex difference', 'Stress']",Neurobiology of aging,2018-05-15,"[{'lastname': 'Fisher', 'firstname': 'Daniel W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bennett', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Hongxin', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.

26703952",Sex Differences in Cognitive Decline in Subjects with High Likelihood of Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.,"Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) biology and progression are not yet fully characterized. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of sex on cognitive progression in subjects with high likelihood of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's and followed up to 10 years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cerebrospinal fluid total-tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ42) ratio values were used to sub-classify 559 MCI subjects (216 females, 343 males) as having ""high"" or ""low"" likelihood for MCI due to Alzheimer's. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models incorporating all follow-ups. The worsening from baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive score (mean, SD) (9 ± 12) in subjects with high likelihood of MCI due to Alzheimer's was markedly greater than that in subjects with low likelihood (1 ± 6, p < 0.0001). Among MCI due to AD subjects, the mean worsening in cognitive score was significantly greater in females (11.58 ± 14) than in males (6.87 ± 11, p = 0.006).

61,29154037,Sex- and age-specific modulation of brain GABA levels in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Age and sex are risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the neurotransmitter systems, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in AD pathogenesis but the relevance of sex-specific GABAergic dysfunction during AD progression remains unknown. In the present study, we utilized state-of-the-art high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance to systematically monitor the brain region-, age-, and sex-specific modulation of GABA levels in wild-type and Tg2576 mice with amyloid pathology. In addition, we followed the possible role of reactive astrocytes in sex-specific GABA modulation. In female Tg2576 mice, hippocampal GABA levels were significantly elevated, along with higher number of reactive astrocytes and amyloid deposition. The elevated GABA was found to be produced via the monoamine oxidase-B route from putrescine in reactive astrocytes, more substantially in female than male mice, thus suggesting a role of astrocytes in memory impairment and sex-related differences in AD. Our results paint a coherent model of memory impairment in AD and signify that dynamic changes in regional GABA may be at the root of marked sex disparities observed in AD.","['(1)H high-resolution magic angle spinning NMR', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'GABA', 'Longitudinal study', 'Sex difference', 'Tg2576 mouse model']",Neurobiology of aging,2017-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'Upasana', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Analytical Chemistry, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stute', 'firstname': 'Lara', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Höfling', 'firstname': 'Corinna', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hartlage-Rübsamen', 'firstname': 'Maike', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Matysik', 'firstname': 'Jörg', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Analytical Chemistry, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Roβner', 'firstname': 'Steffen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Alia', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands.

62,28802916,Brain region- and sex-specific alterations in mitochondrial function and NF-κB signaling in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common late onset neurodegenerative disorder with indications that women are disproportionately affected. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been one of the most discussed hypotheses associated with the early onset and progression of AD, and it has been attributed to intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ). It was suggested that one of the possible mediators for Aβ-impaired mitochondrial function is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. NF-κB plays important roles in brain inflammation and antioxidant defense, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial function, and studies have confirmed altered NF-κB signaling in AD brain. In this study, we looked for sex-based differences in impaired bioenergetic processes and NF-κB signaling in the AD-like brain using transgenic (Tg) CRND8 mice that express excessive brain Aβ, but without tau pathology. Our results show that mitochondrial dysfunction is not uniform in affected brain regions. We observed increased basal and coupled respiration in the hippocampus of TgCRND8 females only, along with a decreased Complex II-dependent respiratory activity. Cortical mitochondria from TgCRND8 mice have reduced uncoupled respiration capacity, regardless of sex. The pattern of changes in NF-κB signaling was the same in both brain structures, but was sex specific. Whereas in females there was an increase in all three subunits of NF-κB, in males we observed increase in p65 and p105, but no changes in p50 levels. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial function and inflammatory signaling in the AD-like brain is region- and sex-specific, which is an important consideration for therapeutic strategies.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'NF-κB', 'TgCRND8', 'cortex', 'hippocampus', 'mitochondria']",Neuroscience,2017-08-15,"[{'lastname': 'Djordjevic', 'firstname': 'Jelena', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders, St Boniface Hospital Research Centre, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.

63,28025281,Meta-analysis of Driving Cessation and Dementia: Does Sex Matter?,"The number of drivers with dementia is expected to increase over the coming decades. Because dementia is associated with a higher risk of crashes, driving cessation becomes inevitable as the disease progresses, but many people with dementia resist stopping to drive. This meta-analysis examines whether there are sex differences in the prevalence and incidence of driving cessation among drivers with dementia and compares the pattern of sex differences in drivers with dementia to those without dementia.
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched in July 2015 for observational studies of sex differences in driving cessation. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model.
Twenty studies provided data on sex differences in driving cessation in older adults with or without dementia. Driving cessation was significantly more prevalent in women with dementia than men (odds ratio [OR] = 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50-2.98), and the same pattern was found in women without dementia (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.85-4.06).
Our findings suggest that the patterns of driving cessation differ between men and women with dementia, and this may have implications for sex-specific approaches designed to support drivers with dementia both before and after driving cessation.",[],"The journals of gerontology.

11796757",Sex and the development of Alzheimer's disease.,"Men and women exhibit differences in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The factors underlying the sex differences in AD are not well understood. This Review emphasizes the contributions of sex steroid hormones to the relationship between sex and AD. In women, events that decrease lifetime exposure to estrogens are generally associated with increased AD risk, whereas estrogen-based hormone therapy administered near the time of menopause may reduce AD risk. In men, estrogens do not exhibit age-related reduction and are not significantly associated with AD risk. Rather, normal age-related depletions of testosterone in plasma and brain predict enhanced vulnerability to AD. Both estrogens and androgens exert numerous protective actions in the adult brain that increase neural functioning and resilience as well as specifically attenuating multiple aspects of AD-related neuropathology. Aging diminishes the activational effects of sex hormones in sex-specific manners, which is hypothesized to contribute to the relationship between aging and AD. Sex steroid hormones may also drive sex differences in AD through their organizational effects during developmental sexual differentiation of the brain. Specifically, sex hormone actions during early development may confer inherent vulnerability of the female brain to development of AD in advanced age. The combined effects of organizational and activational effects of sex steroids yield distinct sex differences in AD pathogenesis, a significant variable that must be more rigorously considered in future research. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'aging', 'estrogen', 'menopause', 'sex differences', 'testosterone']",Journal of neuroscience research,2016-11-22,"[{'lastname': 'Pike', 'firstname': 'Christian J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.'}]",,,,"© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/jnr.23827,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d93946d0>

12475375",Middle-Aged Diabetic Females and Males Present Distinct Susceptibility to Alzheimer Disease-like Pathology.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a highly concerning public health problem of the twenty-first century. Currently, it is estimated that T2D affects 422 million people worldwide with a rapidly increasing prevalence. During the past two decades, T2D has been widely shown to have a major impact in the brain. This, together with the cognitive decline and increased risk for dementia upon T2D, may arise from the complex interaction between normal brain aging and central insulin signaling dysfunction. Among the several features shared between T2D and some neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer disease (AD)), the impairment of insulin signaling may be a key link. However, these may also involve changes in sex hormones' function and metabolism, ultimately contributing to the different susceptibilities between females and males to some pathologies. For example, female sex has been pointed as a risk factor for AD, particularly after menopause. However, less is known on the underlying molecular mechanisms or even if these changes start during middle-age (perimenopause). From the above, we hypothesized that sex differentially affects hormone-mediated intracellular signaling pathways in T2D brain, ultimately modulating the risk for neurodegenerative conditions. We aimed to evaluate sex-associated alterations in estrogen/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/insulin-related signaling, oxidative stress markers, and AD-like hallmarks in middle-aged control and T2D rat brain cortices. We used brain cortices homogenates obtained from middle-aged (8-month-old) control Wistar and non-obese, spontaneously T2D Goto-Kakizaki (GK) male and female rats. Peripheral characterization of the animal models was done by standard biochemical analyses of blood, plasma, or serum. Steroid sex hormones, oxidative stress markers, and AD-like hallmarks were given by specific ELISA kits and colorimetric techniques, whereas the levels of intracellular signaling proteins were determined by Western blotting. Albeit the high levels of plasma estradiol and progesterone observed in middle-aged control females suggested that they were still under their reproductive phase, some gonadal dysfunction might be already occurring in T2D ones, hence, anticipating their menopause. Moreover, the higher blood and lower brain cholesterol levels in female rats suggested that its dysfunctional uptake into the brain cortex may also hamper peripheral estrogen uptake and/or its local brain steroidogenic metabolism. Despite the massive drop in IGF-1 levels in females' brains, particularly upon T2D, they might have developed some compensatory mechanisms towards the maintenance of estrogen, IGF-1, and insulin receptors function and of the subsequent Akt- and ERK1/2-mediated signaling. These may ultimately delay the deleterious AD-like brain changes (including oxidative damage to lipids and DNA, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein and increased tau protein phosphorylation) associated with T2D and/or age (reproductive senescence) in female rats. By demonstrating that differential sex steroid hormone profiles/action may play a pivotal role in brain over T2D progression, the present study reinforces the need to establish sex-specific preventive and/or therapeutic approaches and an appropriate time window for the efficient treatment against T2D and AD.","['Alzheimer disease-like hallmarks', 'Insulin', 'Sex', 'Sex steroids', 'Type 2 diabetes']",Molecular neurobiology,2016-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Candeias', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'CNC- Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, Rua Larga, Faculty of Medicine (Pólo 1, 1st Floor), University of Coimbra, 3004-517, Coimbra, Portugal.\nInstitute for Interdisciplinary Research (IIIUC), University of Coimbra, Casa Costa Alemão - Pólo II, Rua D.

1262439",Sex Differences in Circadian Dysfunction in the BACHD Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that affects men and women in equal numbers, but some epidemiological studies indicate there may be sex differences in disease progression. One of the early symptoms of HD is disruptions in the circadian timing system, but it is currently unknown whether sex is a factor in these alterations. Since sex differences in HD could provide important insights to understand cellular and molecular mechanism(s) and designing early intervention strategies, we used the bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of HD (BACHD) to examine whether sex differences in circadian behavioral rhythms are detectable in an animal model of the disease. Similar to BACHD males, BACHD females display circadian disruptions at both 3 and 6 months of age; however, deficits to BACHD female mouse activity levels, rhythm precision, and behavioral fragmentation are either delayed or less severe relative to males. These sex differences are associated with a smaller suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in BACHD male mice at age of symptom onset (3 months), but are not associated with sex-specific differences in SCN daytime electrical activity deficits, or peptide expression (arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide) within the SCN. Notably, BACHD females exhibited delayed motor coordination deficits, as measured using rotarod and challenge beam. These findings suggest a sex specific factor plays a role both in non-motor and motor symptom progression for the BACHD mouse.",[],PloS one,2016-02-13,"[{'lastname': 'Kuljis', 'firstname': 'Dika A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Gad', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Loh', 'firstname': 'Dawn H', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'MacDowell Kaswan', 'firstname': 'Zoë', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Hitchcock', 'firstname': 'Olivia N', 'initials': 'ON', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghiani', 'firstname': 'Cristina A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.\nDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Colwell', 'firstname': 'Christopher S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0147583

16636170","Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.","Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality is essential for the formation of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence across countries.
We estimated age-sex-specific all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For pathogen-specific causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.
Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65.3 years (UI 65.0-65.6) in 1990, to 71.5 years (UI 71.0-71.9) in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million (UI 46.8-48.2) to 54.9 million (UI 53.6-56.3) over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute differences between countries decreased but relative differences increased. For women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative differences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions.
For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex specific mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.

68,24503613,Prognostic polypeptide blood plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease progression.,"Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have varying risks of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
To test the utility of the relative abundances of blood plasma polypeptides for predicting the risk of AD progression.
119 blood plasma samples of patients with MCI with different outcomes (stable MCI and progressive MCI) were analyzed by untargeted, label-free shotgun proteomics. Predictive biomarkers of progressive MCI were selected by multivariate analysis, followed by cross-validation of the predictive model.
The best model demonstrated the accuracy of ca. 79% in predicting progressive MCI. Sex differences of the predictive biomarkers were also assessed. We have identified some sex-specific protein biomarkers, e.g., alpha-2-macrogloblin (A2M), which strongly correlates with female AD progression but not with males.
Significant sex bias in AD-specific biomarkers underscores the necessity of selecting sex-balanced cohort in AD biomarker studies, or using sex-specific models. Blood protein biomarkers are found to be promising for predicting AD progression in clinical settings.","['Biomarkers', 'human blood plasma', 'label-free quantification', 'mass spectrometry']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2014-02-08,"[{'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Hongqian', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Physiological Chemistry I, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Lyutvinskiy', 'firstname': 'Yaroslav', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Physiological Chemistry I, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Herukka', 'firstname': 'Sanna-Kaisa', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Soininen', 'firstname': 'Hilkka', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rutishauser', 'firstname': 'Dorothea', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Division of Physiological Chemistry I, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Zubarev', 'firstname': 'Roman A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Physiological Chemistry I, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden.'}]",,"Significant sex bias in AD-specific biomarkers underscores the necessity of selecting sex-balanced cohort in AD biomarker studies, or using sex-specific models.

9921852",Clinical epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease: assessing sex and gender differences.,"With the aging of the population, the burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly expanding. More than 5 million people in the US alone are affected with AD and this number is expected to triple by 2050. While men may have a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia, women are disproportionally affected with AD. One explanation is that men may die of competing causes of death earlier in life, so that only the most resilient men may survive to older ages. However, many other factors should also be considered to explain the sex differences. In this review, we discuss the differences observed in men versus women in the incidence and prevalence of MCI and AD, in the structure and function of the brain, and in the sex-specific and gender-specific risk and protective factors for AD. In medical research, sex refers to biological differences such as chromosomal differences (eg, XX versus XY chromosomes), gonadal differences, or hormonal differences. In contrast, gender refers to psychosocial and cultural differences between men and women (eg, access to education and occupation). Both factors play an important role in the development and progression of diseases, including AD. Understanding both sex- and gender-specific risk and protective factors for AD is critical for developing individualized interventions for the prevention and treatment of AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'dementia', 'dimorphic medicine', 'gender', 'risk factors', 'sex']",Clinical epidemiology,2014-01-29,"[{'lastname': 'Mielke', 'firstname': 'Michelle M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA ; Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vemuri', 'firstname': 'Prashanthi', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocca', 'firstname': 'Walter A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA ; Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}]",,,,,10.2147/CLEP.S37929,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05da069040>
70,22738723,Behavioral and neurobiological effects of prenatal stress exposure in male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.,"Epidemiological evidence implies a role for chronic stress and stress-related disorders in the etiopathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although chronic stress exposure during various stages of life has been shown to exacerbate AD-related cognitive deficits and neuropathology in AD mouse models, the role of stress exposure during the prenatal period on AD development and progression remained to be investigated. The present study therefore explored the effects of prenatal maternal stress (PMS) in both male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse offspring in terms of cognition, affect, and AD-related neuropathology. As prenatal perturbations are likely to mediate their effects via alterations in epigenetic regulation, changes in hippocampal DNA methyltransferase 3a, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels were assessed as underlying mechanisms. Repetitive restraint stress during the first week of gestation exerted a sex-dependent effect, with male PMS mice showing spatial memory deficits and a blunted hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis response, while female PMS mice showed improved spatial memory performance, increased depressive-like behavior, as well as a decrease in hippocampal plaque load. In addition, sex differences were observed among APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, independent of PMS (i.e., female mice showed impaired spatial memory performance, higher hippocampal plaque load, altered amyloid precursor protein processing in the CA3 and lower DNA methyltransferase 3a immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus when compared with male mice of the same age). In conclusion, PMS exposure impacts on the behavioral phenotype and neuropathology of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Moreover, given the remarkable sex differences observed, one should not overlook the impact of sex-specific responses to environmental exposures when investigating gene-environment interactions in AD.",[],Neurobiology of aging,2012-06-29,"[{'lastname': 'Sierksma', 'firstname': 'Annerieke S R', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Prickaerts', 'firstname': 'Jos', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chouliaras', 'firstname': 'Leonidas', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rostamian', 'firstname': 'Somayeh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Delbroek', 'firstname': 'Lore', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rutten', 'firstname': 'Bart P F', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Steinbusch', 'firstname': 'Harry W M', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'van den Hove', 'firstname': 'Daniel L A', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

71,22142389,Risk profiles of subtypes of mild cognitive impairment: the sydney memory and ageing study.,"To compare the risk profiles of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes in a population-based elderly sample.
Cross-sectional study.
The population-based Sydney Memory and Ageing Study.
Seven hundred fifty-seven English-speaking, community-dwelling individuals without dementia aged 70 to 90.
Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were used to diagnose MCI and its subtypes, categorized as amnestic (aMCI) or nonamnestic (naMCI) and as single- (sdMCI) or multiple- (mdMCI) domain. Risk profiles were derived from sociodemographic; lifestyle; and cardiac, physical, mental, and general health data. Whole-sample and sex-specific comparisons between aMCI and naMCI and between mdMCI and sdMCI were made using age- (and sex-) adjusted multiple regressions comprising initially significant univariate factors.
Risk factors for MCI were presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, heart disease, high homocysteine, poor odor identification ability, low visual acuity, and lower mental activity. The odds of having naMCI rather than aMCI were lower with greater levels of social activity and greater if taking antihypertensives, the latter particularly in men. The odds of naMCI were greater in men taking antidepressants or with a longer 6-meter walk time and in women with hypertension. The odds of having mdMCI rather than sdMCI were greater in participants with a history of depression or having the APOE ε4 allele. Greater odds of mdMCI were also associated with lower mental activity, particularly for women. For men, the odds of mdMCI were greater with the APOE ε4 allele and lower if diagnosed with high cholesterol.

18631956",Estimation and validation of a multiattribute model of Alzheimer disease progression.,"To estimate and validate a multiattribute model of the clinical course of Alzheimer disease (AD) from mild AD to death in a high-quality prospective cohort study, and to estimate the impact of hypothetical modifications to AD progression rates on costs associated with Medicare and Medicaid services.
The authors estimated sex-specific longitudinal Grade of Membership (GoM) models for AD patients (103 men, 149 women) in the initial cohort of the Predictors Study (1989-2001) based on 80 individual measures obtained every 6 mo for 10 y. These models were replicated for AD patients (106 men, 148 women) in the 2nd Predictors Study cohort (1997-2007). Model validation required that the disease-specific transition parameters be identical for both Predictors Study cohorts. Medicare costs were estimated from the National Long Term Care Survey.
Sex-specific models were validated using the 2nd Predictors Study cohort with the GoM transition parameters constrained to the values estimated for the 1st Predictors Study cohort; 57 to 61 of the 80 individual measures contributed significantly to the GoM models. Simulated, cost-free interventions in the rate of progression of AD indicated that large potential cost offsets could occur for patients at the earliest stages of AD.
AD progression is characterized by a small number of parameters governing changes in large numbers of correlated indicators of AD severity. The analysis confirmed that the progression of AD represents a complex multidimensional physiological process that is similar across different study cohorts. The estimates suggested that there could be large cost offsets to Medicare and Medicaid from the slowing of AD progression among patients with mild AD. The methodology appears generally applicable in AD modeling.",[],Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,2010-12-25,"[{'lastname': 'Stallard', 'firstname': 'Eric', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sociology and Center for Population Health and Aging, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kinosian', 'firstname': 'Bruce', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zbrozek', 'firstname': 'Arthur S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yashin', 'firstname': 'Anatoliy I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Glick', 'firstname': 'Henry A', 'initials': 'HA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stern', 'firstname': 'Yaakov', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Sex-specific models were validated using the 2nd Predictors Study cohort with the GoM transition parameters constrained to the values estimated for the 1st Predictors Study cohort; 57 to 61 of the 80 individual measures contributed significantly to the GoM models.

73,16753269,Cycloxygenase-2 activity promotes cognitive deficits but not increased amyloid burden in a model of Alzheimer's disease in a sex-dimorphic pattern.,"Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in normal aging populations, an effect that may occur from inhibition of the cyclooxygenases, the rate-limiting enzymes in the formation of prostaglandins. In this study, we investigated whether increased activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, potentiates disease progression in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. To study the functional effects of COX-2 activity, male and female bigenic mice (amyloid precursor protein with Swedish mutation [APPswe]-presenilin-1 protein with deletion of exon 9 [PS1dE9] and trigenic COX-2/APPswe-PS1dE9) were behaviorally tested +/-administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Behavioral testing included a three-trial Y maze that measures spatial working and recognition memories and an open field task that tested levels of hyperactivity. Overexpression of COX-2 in APPswe-PS1dE9 mice resulted in specific deficits in spatial working memory in female but not male mice. These sex-specific deficits were abolished by pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 activity. Importantly, COX-2-associated deficits were dependent on co-expression of all three transgenes since COX-2 single transgenic and APPswe-PS1dE9 bigenic mice showed normal memory. Quantification of amyloid plaque load and total Abeta 40 and 42 peptides did not reveal significant differences in trigenic versus bigenic mice treated with either vehicle or celecoxib. Taken together, these data indicate an interaction between the effects of COX-2 and Abeta peptides on cognition that occurs in a sex-specific manner in the absence of significant changes in amyloid burden. These findings suggest that pathological activation of COX-2 may potentiate the toxicity of Abeta peptides, particularly in females, without significantly affecting Abeta accumulation.",[],Neuroscience,2006-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Melnikova', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Savonenko', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Q', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'X', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hand', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kaufmann', 'firstname': 'W E', 'initials': 'WE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vehmas', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Andreasson', 'firstname': 'K I', 'initials': 'KI', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.05.001,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcacf770>
74,10078062,[Epidemiology and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease].,"Alzheimer's disease or dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD/DAT) is one of the most common dementia conditions and it amounts to over 40-90% of dementia cases among elderly and old patients. Epidemiological studies in this area make a great contribution to the study of the etiology and risk factors of AD/DAT). The collaborative reanalysis of AD/DAT prevalence and incidence in EEC countries (""EURODERM"" programme) shows that the overall European age-specific prevalence of AD does not differ greatly. There was an exponential increase in age-specific AD/DAT prevalence was found with age, as evidenced by the studies made in Russia. Sex-specific prevalence and incidence of AD/DAT are unclear since the fact that the condition more often occurs in elderly women than in men of the same age has not been confirmed. The data on risk factors obtained in cohort and case-control studies of AD/DAT have been analyzed. Progress in molecular genetics has identified 3 genes that are responsible for the occurrence of familial forms of the disease. The gene of apolipoprotein E on chromosome 19 is recognized to be the major genetic risk factor of late AD/DAT. The role of gene mutations in the trigger mechanisms of sporadic BA/DAT is also discussed. The environmental risk factors of AD/DAT include brain injury, viral infections, neutroxic chemicals, various immunological and hormonal disorders. The protective role of such factors as long-term use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents and estrogens is discussed. The involvement of nicotine dependence in the pathogenesis and the role of smoking as a possible protective factor are the subject of discussion. Such factors as education levels, occupation, stresses are widely discussed, although their role is considered to be controversial. The Russian study revealed the influence of chronic stress on AD development. The authors consider that chronic stress may play an important role in AD/DAT progression.",[],Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk,1999-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Gavrilova', 'firstname': 'S I', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bratsun', 'firstname': 'A L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcaae950>
75,2330103,An examination of male-female differences in progression and mortality of Parkinson's disease.,"We conducted disability and mortality studies to determine if the male preponderance usually found in Parkinson's disease (PD) was reflected in different courses of the diseases in the 2 sexes. We analyzed longitudinal disability score in 47 men and 23 women with PD followed for 6 years at UCLA. We found no significant differences between the sexes in mean disability scores in any of the 6 years. Mean dopa dosage was significantly higher in men, possibly reflecting their generally larger body mass. Choreoathetosis, dementia, or other side effects did not differ between the 2 groups. We obtained observed to expected mortality ratios in 239 men and 132 women followed for 3,831 person-years from records of 4 medical centers. Using the sex-specific US Life Tables to calculate expected mortality, we found the observed to expected ratio for the men was 1.7457 and for the women 2.4740, a significantly greater excess in female mortality. Analyses of mortality using tables which are not sex-specific will fail to uncover the decreased longevity in women with PD. We conclude that, despite the male preponderance in PD, men and women acquire it at the same age, have the same progression and duration of disease, and die at the same age; whereas, in the general population, women have a longer life expectancy than men. It is not known what factors protect women from incurring PD and what lowers their life expectancy to that of men when they do have the disease.",[],Neurology,1990-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Diamond', 'firstname': 'S G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1769.'}, {'lastname': 'Markham', 'firstname': 'C H', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hoehn', 'firstname': 'M M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McDowell', 'firstname': 'F H', 'initials': 'FH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Muenter', 'firstname': 'M D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1212/wnl.40.5.763,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcad5e50>
