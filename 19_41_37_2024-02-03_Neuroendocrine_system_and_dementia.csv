26864406",Converged avenues: depression and Alzheimer's disease- shared pathophysiology and novel therapeutics.,"Depression, a highly prevalent disorder affecting over 280 million people worldwide, is comorbid with many neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depression and AD share overlapping pathophysiology, and the search for accountable biological substrates made it an essential and intriguing field of research. The paper outlines the neurobiological pathways coinciding with depression and AD, including neurotrophin signalling, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), cellular apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and other aetiological factors. Understanding overlapping pathways is crucial in identifying common pathophysiological substrates that can be targeted for effective management of disease state. Antidepressants, particularly monoaminergic drugs (first-line therapy), are shown to have modest or no clinical benefits. Regardless of the ineffectiveness of conventional antidepressants, these drugs remain the mainstay for treating depressive symptoms in AD. To overcome the ineffectiveness of traditional pharmacological agents in treating comorbid conditions, a novel therapeutic class has been discussed in the paper. This includes neurotransmitter modulators, glutamatergic system modulators, mitochondrial modulators, antioxidant agents, HPA axis targeted therapy, inflammatory system targeted therapy, neurogenesis targeted therapy, repurposed anti-diabetic agents, and others. The primary clinical challenge is the development of therapeutic agents and the effective diagnosis of the comorbid condition for which no specific diagnosable scale is present. Hence, introducing Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare system is revolutionary. AI implemented with interdisciplinary strategies (neuroimaging, EEG, molecular biomarkers) bound to have accurate clinical interpretation of symptoms. Moreover, AI has the potential to forecast neurodegenerative and psychiatric illness much in advance before visible/observable clinical symptoms get precipitated.","['Alzheimer’s disease (AD)', 'Antidepressant therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Comorbidity', 'Major depressive disorder (MDD)', 'Novel antidepressants']",Molecular biology reports,2024-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Bajaj', 'firstname': 'Shivanshu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, 333031, Rajasthan, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahesh', 'firstname': 'Radhakrishnan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, 333031, Rajasthan, India. rmahesh@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in.'}]",,,,"© 2024.

1,38179773,"A More Holistic Perspective of Alzheimer's Disease: Roles of Gut Microbiome, Adipocytes, HPA Axis, Melatonergic Pathway and Astrocyte Mitochondria in the Emergence of Autoimmunity.","Alzheimer's disease is widely regarded as poorly treated due to poor conceptualization. For 40 years, Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology has focused on two culprits, amyloid-β induced plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau associated tangles, with no significant treatment advance. This is confounded by data showing amyloid-β to be an endogenous antimicrobial that is increased in a wide array of diverse medical conditions associated with heightened inflammation. This article reviews the wider bodies of data pertaining to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, highlighting the role of suppressed astrocyte mitochondrial function and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway as a core hub in driving neuronal loss in dementia. It is proposed that astrocyte function over aging becomes dysregulated, at least partly mediated by systemic processes involving the 10-fold decrease in pineal melatonin leading to the attenuated capacity of night-time melatonin to dampen residual daytime inflammation. Suppressed pineal melatonin also attenuates melatonin's inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation, thereby changing not only stress/hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis consequences but also the consequences of the cortisol awakening response, which 'primes the body for the coming day'. Gut microbiome-derived butyrate also inhibits glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation, as well as inducing the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. It is proposed that the loss of astrocyte melatonin prevents the autocrine and paracrine effects of melatonin in limiting amyloid-β levels and effects. Suppressed astrocyte melatonin production also attenuates the melatonin induction of astrocyte lactate, thereby decreasing neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and the neuronal mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. The loss of astrocyte lactate and melatonin, coupled to the suppression of neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and melatonin production decreases mitophagy, leading to the induction of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1. MHC-1 initiates the chemoattraction of CD8+ t cells, leading to neuronal destruction in Alzheimer's disease being driven by 'autoimmune'/'immune-mediated' processes. Alzheimer's disease may therefore be conceptualized as being initiated by systemic processes that act on astrocytes as a core hub, with the suppression of the astrocyte melatonergic pathway leaving neurons deplete of appropriate metabolic substrates and co-ordinated antioxidants. This culminates in an 'immune-mediated' cell death. Future research and treatment/prevention implications are indicated.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'HPA axis', 'N-acetylserotonin', 'adipocytes', 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'glucocorticoid receptor', 'gut microbiome', 'kynurenine', 'melatonin', 'treatment']",Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),2024-01-05,"[{'lastname': 'Anderson', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'CRC Scotland & London, SW1V 1PG London, UK.'}]",,,,© 2023 The Author(s).

2,37930827,Procyanidins and sensory nutrition; Do procyanidins modulate homeostasis via astringent taste receptors?,"Long-term intake of procyanidins has been suggested to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and sensory function decline associated with aging. However, most of the ingested procyanidins are not absorbed and are excreted in the feces, so the mechanism of their beneficial impact is unknown. Procyanidins are the components of astringency in plant foods and their stimulation appears to be directly transmitted to the central nervous system via sensory nerves. Recent attention has been focused on the taste receptors expressed in the extra-oral gastrointestinal tract may regulate homeostasis via the neuroendocrine system. In this paper, we have reviewed recent findings on the relationship between the astringency of procyanidins and their bioregulatory effects.","['Procyanidins', 'astringency', 'gastrointestinal - brain axis', 'hormesis', 'sensory nutrition']","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",2023-11-06,"[{'lastname': 'Osakabe', 'firstname': 'Naomi', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Functional Control Systems, Graduate School of Engineering and Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology.\nSystems Engineering and Science, Graduate School of Engineering and Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology.\nDepartment of Bio-science and Engineering, Faculty of System Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology.'}, {'lastname': 'Fushimi', 'firstname': 'Taiki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Functional Control Systems, Graduate School of Engineering and Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujii', 'firstname': 'Yasuyuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bio-science and Engineering, Faculty of System Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology.'}, {'lastname': 'Calabrese', 'firstname': 'Vittorio', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Catania, 95125 Catania.'}]",,,,"© The Author(s) 2023.

3,37872793,Early Chronic Stress Induced Changes within the Locus Coeruleus in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.,"Chronic exposure to stress throughout the lifespan has been the focus of many studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the similarities between the biological mechanisms involved in chronic stress and the pathophysiology of AD. In fact, the earliest abnormality associated with the disease is the presence of phosphorylated tau protein in locus coeruleus neurons, a brain structure highly responsive to stress and perceived threat. Here, we introduce allostatic load as a useful concept for understanding many of the complex, interacting neuropathological changes involved in the AD degenerative process. In response to chronic stress, aberrant tau proteins that begin to accumulate within the locus coeruleus decades prior to symptom onset appear to represent a primary pathological event in the AD cascade, triggering a wide range of interacting brain changes involving neuronal excitotoxicity, endocrine alterations, inflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid plaque exacerbation. While it is acknowledged that stress will not necessarily be the major precipitating factor in all cases, early tau-induced changes within the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine pathway suggests that a therapeutic window might exist for preventative measures aimed at managing stress and restoring balance within the HPA axis.","['LC', 'Tau', 'allostatic load', 'chronic stress', 'dementia', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuroticism', 'norepinephrine']",Current Alzheimer research,2023-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Minné', 'firstname': 'Donné', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbial & Health Biotechnology Institute, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, 7535, South Africa.\nFaculty of Health and Wellness Sciences, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, 7535, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Marnewick', 'firstname': 'Jeanine L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbial & Health Biotechnology Institute, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, 7535, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Engel-Hills', 'firstname': 'Penelope', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health and Wellness Sciences, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, 7535, South Africa.'}]",,,,"Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",10.2174/1567205020666230811092956,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8f32c70>

34298088",Biosynthesis of neuroprotective melatonin is dysregulated in Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder associated with uncontrolled body movements, cognitive decline, and reduced circulating melatonin levels. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and exogenous melatonin treatment is neuroprotective in experimental HD models. In neurons, melatonin is exclusively synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, we investigated the integrity of melatonin biosynthesis pathways in pineal and extrapineal brain areas in human HD brain samples, in the R6/2 mouse model of HD and in full-length mutant huntingtin knock-in cells. Aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) is the rate-limiting step enzyme in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway. We found that AANAT expression is significantly decreased in the pineal gland and the striatum of HD patients compared to normal controls. In the R6/2 mouse forebrain, AANAT protein expression was decreased in synaptosomal, but not nonsynaptosomal, mitochondria and was associated with decreased synaptosomal melatonin levels compared to wild type mice. We also demonstrate sequestration of AANAT in mutant-huntingtin protein aggregates likely resulting in decreased AANAT bioavailability. Paradoxically, AANAT mRNA expression is increased in tissues where AANAT protein expression is decreased, suggesting a potential feedback loop that is, ultimately unsuccessful. In conclusion, we demonstrate that pineal, extrapineal, and synaptosomal melatonin levels are compromised in the brains of HD patients and R6/2 mice due, at least in part, to protein aggregation.","[""Huntington's disease"", 'melatonin', 'mitochondria']",Journal of pineal research,2023-09-18,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jinho', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jingjing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baranov', 'firstname': 'Sergei V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Heath', 'firstname': 'Brianna E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jia', 'firstname': 'Jiaoying', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Suofu', 'firstname': 'Yalikun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baranova', 'firstname': 'Oxana V', 'initials': 'OV', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiaomin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Larkin', 'firstname': 'Timothy M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lariviere', 'firstname': 'William R', 'initials': 'WR', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlisle', 'firstname': 'Diane L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Friedlander', 'firstname': 'Robert M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Neuroapoptosis Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}]",,,,© 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

18202581",Effect of exercise on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis dysregulation was suggested to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the effects of exercise on HPG hormones in an AD rat model, as a possible mechanism underlying the favorable effect of exercise on AD. Forty male Wistar albino rats 2-3 months old were subdivided randomly into two groups (n = 20 each): AD group (injected intraperitoneally with aluminum chloride (70 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks) and Control group. Each group was subdivided into exercised or non-exercised group (n = 10 each). Exercised groups were subjected to a swimming protocol (60 min/day, 5 days/week, 4 weeks). Serum HPG hormones, hippocampal β-amyloid levels and Morris water-maze cognition were assessed. Results demonstrated higher levels of β-amyloid, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) together with lower testosterone levels and cognitive impairment in the AD rats compared to controls. Β-amyloid levels negatively correlated with testosterone levels and positively correlated with GnRH, LH and FSH among the AD rats. Higher testosterone and lower GnRH, LH, FSH and β-amyloid levels, as well as cognitive improvement, were observed in the exercised compared to non-exercised AD rats, suggesting a modulatory role of exercise training on AD-associated HPG axis dysregulation.",[],Scientific reports,2023-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Khairy', 'firstname': 'Eman Y', 'initials': 'EY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, 165, Horreya Avenue, Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt. eman.hassan@alexu.edu.eg.'}, {'lastname': 'Salama', 'firstname': 'Ola A', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, 165, Horreya Avenue, Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt.'}]",,,,© 2023.

16134144",Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics define the natural history of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology develops many years before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Two pathological processes-aggregation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide into plaques and the microtubule protein tau into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)-are hallmarks of the disease. However, other pathological brain processes are thought to be key disease mediators of Aβ plaque and NFT pathology. How these additional pathologies evolve over the course of the disease is currently unknown. Here we show that proteomic measurements in autosomal dominant AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) linked to brain protein coexpression can be used to characterize the evolution of AD pathology over a timescale spanning six decades. SMOC1 and SPON1 proteins associated with Aβ plaques were elevated in AD CSF nearly 30 years before the onset of symptoms, followed by changes in synaptic proteins, metabolic proteins, axonal proteins, inflammatory proteins and finally decreases in neurosecretory proteins. The proteome discriminated mutation carriers from noncarriers before symptom onset as well or better than Aβ and tau measures. Our results highlight the multifaceted landscape of AD pathophysiology and its temporal evolution. Such knowledge will be critical for developing precision therapeutic interventions and biomarkers for AD beyond those associated with Aβ and tau.",[],Nature medicine,2023-08-08,"[{'lastname':

7,37471539,Immune-mediated denervation of the pineal gland underlies sleep disturbance in cardiac disease.,"Disruption of the physiologic sleep-wake cycle and low melatonin levels frequently accompany cardiac disease, yet the underlying mechanism has remained enigmatic. Immunostaining of sympathetic axons in optically cleared pineal glands from humans and mice with cardiac disease revealed their substantial denervation compared with controls. Spatial, single-cell, nuclear, and bulk RNA sequencing traced this defect back to the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), which responded to cardiac disease with accumulation of inflammatory macrophages, fibrosis, and the selective loss of pineal gland-innervating neurons. Depletion of macrophages in the SCG prevented disease-associated denervation of the pineal gland and restored physiological melatonin secretion.

8,37466061,The relationship between thyroid deficiency and blood-based biomarkers of cognitive disorders.,"Thyroid hormones play an essential role in metabolism regulation and circadian rhythm control. Recent studies approved their role in normal development and healthy function of central nervous system (CNS). The thyroid gland is a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis disrupted during thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, two main clinical conditions that induce more liability against dementia-related disease.
In the first step, this study evaluated the circular level of neuropeptide Y (NPY), leptin, oxytocin, and vasopressin in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism patients. In the second step, we investigated neurological and cognitive abnormalities by assessment of the hallmark proteins and peptides such as amyloid β (Aβ) variants, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), and tau protein in thyroid-deficient samples.
The results show increased content of leptin hormone in patients with hypothyroidism who also manifested high levels of vasopressin. Underactivation and overactivation of the thyroid gland are accompanied by reduced circular oxytocin. We may conclude that thyroid deficiency is associated with neurohormone dysregulation. Interestingly, both patient groups exhibited significant increases in Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels relative to the control group, which was also accompanied by the rise in GSK-3β; this might be interpreted as cholinergic system dysfunction and cognitive impairment. The results revealed tau content increased considerably in thyrotoxicosis but did not change significantly in hypothyroidism compared to the control group.
Therefore, our results have shown that thyroid gland dysfunction is a risk factor for cognitive impairment, mainly through neuroendocrine dysregulation. This study provides a relationship between hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism and biomarkers of neurological abnormalities in blood serum.",[],Neuro endocrinology letters,2023-07-19,"[{'lastname': 'Alamara', 'firstname': 'Dheyaa Obaid', 'initials': 'DO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Sadeghi', 'firstname': 'Leila', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Dehghan', 'firstname': 'Gholamreza', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.'}]","In the first step, this study evaluated the circular level of neuropeptide Y (NPY), leptin, oxytocin, and vasopressin in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism patients.

33579855","Hepatic Oxi-Inflammation and Neophobia as Potential Liver-Brain Axis Targets for Alzheimer's Disease and Aging, with Strong Sensitivity to Sex, Isolation, and Obesity.","Research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has classically focused on alterations that occur in the brain and their intra- and extracellular neuropathological hallmarks. However, the oxi-inflammation hypothesis of aging may also play a role in neuroimmunoendocrine dysregulation and the disease's pathophysiology, where the liver emerges as a target organ due to its implication in regulating metabolism and supporting the immune system. In the present work, we demonstrate organ (hepatomegaly), tissue (histopathological amyloidosis), and cellular oxidative stress (decreased glutathione peroxidase and increased glutathione reductase enzymatic activities) and inflammation (increased IL-6 and TNF𝛼) as hallmarks of hepatic dysfunction in 16-month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice at advanced stages of the disease, and as compared to age- and sex-matched non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts. Moreover, liver-brain axis alterations were found through behavioral (increased neophobia) and HPA axis correlations that were enhanced under forced isolation. In all cases, sex (male) and isolation (naturalistic and forced) were determinants of worse hepatomegaly, oxidative stress, and inflammation progression. In addition, obesity in old male NTg mice was translated into a worse steatosis grade. Further research is underway determine whether these alterations could correlate with a worse disease prognosis and to establish potential integrative system targets for AD research.","['3xTg-AD', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'HPA axis', 'amyloidosis', 'corticosterone', 'liver–brain axis', 'obesity', 'oxidative stress', 'social isolation', 'steatosis']",Cells,2023-06-10,"[{'lastname': 'Fraile-Ramos', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Neurociències, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Garrit', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Reig-Vilallonga', 'firstname': 'Josep', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Giménez-Llort', 'firstname': 'Lydia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Neurociències, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/cells12111517

28881854","Dysbiosis and Alzheimer's disease: role of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia and the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain. Recently, microbial dysbiosis has been identified as one of the major factors involved in the onset and progression of AD. Imbalance in gut microbiota is known to affect central nervous system (CNS) functions through the gut-brain axis and involves inflammatory, immune, neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. An altered gut microbiome is known to affect the gut and BBB permeability, resulting in imbalance in levels of neurotransmitters and neuroactive peptides/factors. Restoration of levels of beneficial microorganisms in the gut has demonstrated promising effects in AD in pre-clinical and clinical studies. The current review enlists the important beneficial microbial species present in the gut, the effect of their metabolites on CNS, mechanisms involved in dysbiosis related to AD and the beneficial effects of probiotics on AD. It also highlights challenges involved in large-scale manufacturing and quality control of probiotic formulations.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Dysbiosis', 'Gut microbiota', 'Probiotics']",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2023-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Thakkar', 'firstname': 'Ami', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal's Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai, India.""}, {'lastname': 'Vora', 'firstname': 'Amisha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal's Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai, India. amisha.vora@nmims.edu.""}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Ginpreet', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal's Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai, India.""}, {'lastname': 'Akhtar', 'firstname': 'Jamal', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, Ministry of AYUSH, New Delhi, India.'}]",,,,"© 2023.

30115946",The fibroblast growth factor system in cognitive disorders and dementia.,"Cognitive impairment is the core precursor to dementia and other cognitive disorders. Current hypotheses suggest that they share a common pathological basis, such as inflammation, restricted neurogenesis, neuroendocrine disorders, and the destruction of neurovascular units. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are cell growth factors that play essential roles in various pathophysiological processes via paracrine or autocrine pathways. This system consists of FGFs and their receptors (FGFRs), which may hold tremendous potential to become a new biological marker in the diagnosis of dementia and other cognitive disorders, and serve as a potential target for drug development against dementia and cognitive function impairment. Here, we review the available evidence detailing the relevant pathways mediated by multiple FGFs and FGFRs, and recent studies examining their role in the pathogenesis and treatment of cognitive disorders and dementia.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'cognitive disorders', 'dementia', 'fibroblast growth factor', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor', 'neurodegenerative diseases']",Frontiers in neuroscience,2023-05-22,"[{'lastname': 'Zhai', 'firstname': 'Wujianwen', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Research and Development Center, Guang' Anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Tong', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Research and Development Center, Guang' Anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Yujing', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Research and Development Center, Guang' Anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Shijing', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Research and Development Center, Guang' Anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Manman', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Research and Development Center, Guang' Anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Pan', 'firstname': 'Juhua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Research and Development Center, Guang' Anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}]",,,,"Copyright © 2023 Zhai, Zhang, Jin, Huang, Xu and Pan.","10.3389/fnins.2023.1136266

13,37150422,Effects of Danggui-Shaoyao-San on central neuroendocrine and pharmacokinetics in female ovariectomized rats.,"The traditional Chinese medicine formula Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) has been reported to have estrogen-like effects and therapeutic effects on the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
To explore whether the central oxytocin and neuroendocrine system is involved in the modulating effects of DSS on the cognition and neuropsychiatric hebaviors in female AD rats, and to investigate the pharmacokinetics of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in female AD rats with DSS treatment.
DSS (1.2, 3.2, 8.6 g/kg/day) was orally administered to ovariectomized (OVX) rats, and saline was orally administered to sham operation rats as control group. The Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and passive avoidance test were conducted for evaluation of learning and memory abilities, while elevated plus maze test and forced swim test were performed to assess anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. ELISA kits were used to detect the levels of estrogen (E), estrogen receptor α (ERα), oxytocin (OT), oxytocin receptor (OTR), acetylcholine (Ach), acetylcholin esterase (AchE), and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) in the cortex. The concentrations of Ach, glutamate (Glu), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus were assessed by HPLC-MS. The changes of neuronal morphology in the hippocampus were observed by Nissl staining. The pharmacokinetics of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in OVX rats with DSS treatment were studied by HPLC.
In the Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and passive avoidance test, OVX rats showed cognitive impairment. In the elevated plus maze test and forced swim test, the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors of OVX rats were significant as compared to the control group. Treatment of DSS significantly imporved the cognitive deficits, and ameliorated anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors of OVX rats. The expression of E, ERα, OT, OTR, AchE and ChAT in the cortex of model group were significantly decreased, and DSS significantly reversed these changes. The concentrations of Ach, Glu, GABA, 5-HT and NE in the hippocampus of OVX rats were significantly decreased, whereas DSS significantly increased the levels of Ach, Glu, GABA, 5-HT and NE. There was no significant difference in the concentration of DA in the hippocampus among groups. Degenerating neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region were observed in OVX rats, and the number of neurons was decreased. DSS treatment reduced the degenerating neurons, and incresed the number of neurons. The MRT (0 - ∞), AUC (0 - ∞), Cmax and t1/2z values of paeoniflorin, and the AUC 
DSS improves the learning and memory ability, and attenuates anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors of OVX rats. The mechanism may be through increasing estrogen, reducing cholinergic damage, and modulating neurotransmitters. The increase in absorption and elimination time of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in OVX rats may enhance the efficacy of DSS.","['Danggui-Shaoyao-San', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Ovariectomy', 'Pharmacokinetics']",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2023-05-08,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Fu-Gang', 'initials': 'FG', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Pharmacology, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, Shandong, 271016, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Pharmacology, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, Shandong, 271016, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Pharmacology, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, Shandong, 271016, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Xu-Ri', 'initials': 'XR', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Pharmacology, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, Shandong, 271016, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Fu-Wang', 'initials': 'FW', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Pharmacology, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, Shandong, 271016, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Shuang-Shuang', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Pharmacology, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, Shandong, 271016, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Xue-Qin', 'initials': 'XQ', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Pharmacology, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, Shandong, 271016, PR China.

14,37120476,Clinical Ageing.,"Ageing is generally characterised by the declining ability to respond to stress, increasing homeostatic imbalance, and increased risk of ageing-associated diseases . Mechanistically, the lifelong accumulation of a wide range of molecular and cellular impairments leads to organismal senescence. The aging population poses a severe medical concern due to the burden it places on healthcare systems and the general public as well as the prevalence of diseases and impairments associated with old age. In this chapter, we discuss organ failure during ageing as well as ageing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and drugs that can regulate it. A much-debated subject is about ageing and regeneration. With age, there is a gradual decline in the regenerative properties of most tissues. The goal of regenerative medicine is to restore cells, tissues, and structures that are lost or damaged after disease, injury, or ageing. The question arises as to whether this is due to the intrinsic ageing of stem cells or, rather, to the impairment of stem-cell function in the aged tissue environment. The risk of having a stroke event doubles each decade after the age of 55. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop neurorestorative therapies for stroke which occurs mostly in elderly people. Initial enthusiasm for stimulating restorative processes in the ischaemic brain with cell-based therapies has meanwhile converted into a more balanced view, recognising impediments related to survival, migration, differentiation, and integration of therapeutic cells in the hostile aged brain environment. Therefore, a current lack of understanding of the fate of transplanted cells means that the safety of cell therapy in stroke patients is still unproven. Another issue associated with ischaemic stroke is that patients at risk for these sequels of stroke are not duly diagnosed and treated due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. However, recently neurovascular unit-derived exosomes in response to Stroke and released into serum are new plasma genetic and proteomic biomarkers associated with ischaemic stroke. The second valid option, which is also more economical, is to invest in prevention.","['Ageing', 'Comorbidities', 'Dementia', 'Genomics', 'Obesity', 'Rehabilitation', 'Stroke']",Sub-cellular biochemistry,2023-04-30,"[{'lastname': 'Surugiu', 'firstname': 'Roxana', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Research Centre for Normal and Pathological Aging, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Craiova, Romania.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Burdusel', 'firstname': 'Daiana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Research Centre for Normal and Pathological Aging, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Craiova, Romania.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruscu', 'firstname': 'Mihai-Andrei', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Research Centre for Normal and Pathological Aging, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Craiova, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Cercel', 'firstname': 'Andreea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics Group, Sant Pau Hospital Institute of Research, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Hermann', 'firstname': 'Dirk M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Research Centre for Normal and Pathological Aging, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Craiova, Romania.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Cadenas', 'firstname': 'Israel Fernandez', 'initials': 'IF', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics Group, Sant Pau Hospital Institute of Research, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Popa-Wagner', 'firstname': 'Aurel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Research Centre for Normal and Pathological Aging, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Craiova, Romania. aurel.popa-wagner@geriatrics-healthyageing.com.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. aurel.popa-wagner@geriatrics-healthyageing.com.'}]",,,,"© 2023.

33419664",Etiology of anxious and fearful behavior in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN3 disease).,"Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL, CLN3) is a childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease with prominent symptoms comprising a pediatric dementia syndrome. As in adult dementia, behavioral symptoms like mood disturbances and anxiety are common. In contrast to in adult dementia, however, the anxious behavioral symptoms increase during the terminal phase of JNCL disease. In the present study, the current understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety and anxious behavior in general is addressed as will a discussion of the mechanism of the anxious behavior seen in young JNCL patients. Based on developmental behavioral points of view, known neurobiological mechanisms, and the clinical presentation of the anxious behavior, a theory of its etiology is described.
During the terminal phase, the cognitive developmental age of JNCL patients is below 2 years. At this stage of mental development individuals act primarily from a concrete world of consciousness and do not have the cognitive ability to encounter a normal anxiety response. Instead, they experience the evolutionary basic emotion of fear, and as the episodes typically are provoked when the adolescent JNCL patient is exposed to either loud sounds, is lifted from the ground, or separated from the mother/known caregiver, the fear can best be perceived as the developmental natural fear-response that appears in children 0-2 years of age. The efferent pathways of the neural fear circuits are mediated through autonomic, neuroendocrine, and skeletal-motor responses. The autonomic activation occurs early, is mediated through the sympathetic and parasympathetic neural systems, and as JNCL patients beyond puberty have an autonomic imbalance with a significant sympathetic hyperactivity, the activation of the autonomic nervous system results in a disproportionate high sympathetic activity resulting in tachycardia, tachypnea, excessive sweating, hyperthermia, and an increased atypical muscle activity. The episodes are thus phenotypically similar to what is seen as Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity (PSH) following an acute traumatic brain injury. As in PSH, treatment is difficult and so far, no consensus of a treatment algorithm exists. Use of sedative and analgesic medication and minimizing or avoiding provocative stimuli may partly reduce the frequency and intensity of the attacks. Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation might be an option worth to investigate rebalancing the sympathetic-parasympathetic disproportion.","['CLN3', 'Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis', 'neurodegenerative diseases']",Frontiers in psychiatry,2023-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Ostergaard', 'firstname': 'John R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Child and Adolescence, Centre for Rare Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2023 Ostergaard.,"10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1059082

18,36776123,Effects of mutant huntingtin in oxytocin neurons on non-motor features of Huntington's disease.,"Early non-motor features including anxiety, depression and altered social cognition are present in Huntington's disease (HD). The underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not known. Oxytocin (OXT) is involved in the regulation of emotion, social cognition and metabolism, and our previous work showed that the OXT system is affected early in HD. The aim of the study was to investigate the potential causal relationship between the selective expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) in OXT neurons and the development of non-motor features and neuropathology.
To express mHTT only in OXT neurons, we used a novel flex-switch adeno-associated viral vector design to selectively express either mHTT or wild-type HTT in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus using OXT-Cre-recombinase mice. We also performed a mirror experiment to selectively delete mHTT in OXT neurons using the BACHD mouse model. Mice underwent a battery of behavioural tests to assess psychiatric and social behaviours 3 months post-injection or at 2 months of age, respectively. Post-mortem analyses were performed to assess the effects on the OXT system.
Our results show that selective expression of mHTT in OXT neurons was associated with the formation of mHTT inclusions and a 26% reduction of OXT-immunopositive neurons as well as increased anxiety-like behaviours compared with uninjected mice. However, selective deletion of mHTT from OXT neurons alone was not sufficient to alter the metabolic and psychiatric phenotype of the BACHD mice at this early time point.
Our results indicate that mHTT expression can exert cell-autonomous toxic effects on OXT neurons without affecting the non-motor phenotype at early time points in mice.","[""Huntington's disease"", 'behavioural symptoms', 'huntingtin protein', 'hypothalamus', 'oxytocin', 'paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus']",Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,2023-02-14,"[{'lastname': 'Bergh', 'firstname': 'Sofia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Gabery', 'firstname': 'Sanaz', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Tonetto', 'firstname': 'Simone', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirik', 'firstname': 'Deniz', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Brain Repair and Imaging in Neural Systems (BRAINS) Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Åsa', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheong', 'firstname': 'Rachel Y', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}]",,,"Our results show that selective expression of mHTT in OXT neurons was associated with the formation of mHTT inclusions and a 26% reduction of OXT-immunopositive neurons as well as increased anxiety-like behaviours compared with uninjected mice.

25435336","Persisting neuropsychiatric symptoms, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrospinal fluid cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.","Neuropsychiatric symptoms are important treatment targets in the management of dementia and can be present at very early clinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Increased cortisol has been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been associated with faster cognitive decline. Elevated cortisol output has been observed in relation to perceived stress, depression, and anxiety. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) has known anti-glucocorticoid effects and may counter the effects of cortisol.
We aimed to examine whether CSF cortisol and DHEAS levels were associated with (1) neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline, (2) changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms over 3 years, and (3) whether these associations were related to or independent of AD pathology.
One hundred and eighteen participants on a prospective study in a memory clinic setting, including patients with cognitive impairment (n = 78), i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, and volunteers with normal cognition (n = 40), were included. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). CSF cortisol and DHEAS, as well as CSF AD biomarkers, were obtained at baseline. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were re-assessed at follow-up visits 18 and 36 months from baseline. We constructed linear regression models to examine the links between baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms, the presence of AD pathology as indicated by CSF biomarkers, and CSF cortisol and DHEAS. We used repeated-measures mixed ANCOVA models to examine the associations between the neuropsychiatric symptoms' changes over time, baseline CSF cortisol and DHEAS, and AD pathology.
Higher CSF cortisol was associated with higher NPI-Q severity scores at baseline after controlling for covariates including AD pathology status (B = 0.085 [0.027; 0.144], p = 0.027; r = 0.277). In particular, higher CSF cortisol was associated with higher baseline scores of depression/dysphoria, anxiety, and apathy/indifference. Elevated CSF cortisol was also associated with more marked increase in NPI-Q scores over time regardless of AD status (p = 0.036, η
Higher CSF cortisol may reflect or contribute to more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline, as well as more pronounced worsening over 3 years, independently of the presence of AD pathology. Our findings also suggest that interventions targeting the HPA axis may be helpful to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia', 'Biomarkers', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cortisol', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate', 'Neuropsychiatric symptoms']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2022-12-19,"[{'lastname': 'Ouanes', 'firstname': 'Sami', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Old Age Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. sami.ouanes@gmail.com.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO BOX 3050, Doha, Qatar. sami.ouanes@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Rabl', 'firstname': 'Miriam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Gerontopsychiatric Medicine, Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, University Hospital of Psychiatry, Minervastrasse 145, P.O.

26687838",Conserved YKL-40 changes in mice and humans after postoperative delirium.,"Delirium is a common postoperative neurologic complication among older adults. Despite its prevalence (14%-50%) and likely association with inflammation, the exact mechanisms that underpin postoperative delirium are unclear. This project aimed to characterize systemic and central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory changes following surgery in mice and humans. Matched plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the ""Investigating Neuroinflammation Underlying Postoperative Brain Connectivity Changes, Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction, Delirium in Older Adults"" (INTUIT; NCT03273335) study were compared to murine endpoints. Delirium-like behavior was evaluated in aged mice using the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Test (5-CSRTT). Using a well established orthopedic surgical model in the FosTRAP reporter mouse we detected neuronal changes in the prefrontal cortex, an area implicated in attention, but notably not in the hippocampus. In aged mice, plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels increased after orthopedic surgery, but hippocampal YKL-40 expression was decreased. Given the growing evidence for a YKL-40 role in delirium and other neurodegenerative conditions, we assayed human plasma and CSF samples. Plasma YKL-40 levels were similarly increased after surgery, with a trend toward a greater postoperative plasma YKL-40 increase in patients with delirium. However, YKL-40 levels in CSF decreased following surgery, which paralleled the findings in the mouse brain. Finally, we confirmed changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as early as 9 h after surgery in mice, which warrants more detailed and acute evaluations of BBB integrity following surgery in humans. Together, these results provide a nuanced understanding of neuroimmune interactions underlying postoperative delirium in mice and humans, and highlight translational biomarkers to test potential cellular targets and mechanisms.","['4-OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen', '5-CSRTT, 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Test', 'AD, Alzheimer’s disease', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'BBB, blood-brain barrier', 'Biomarkers', 'CAM, Confusion AssessmentMethod', 'CNS, central nervous system', 'CSF, cerebrospinal fluid', 'Delirium', 'ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay', 'GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein', 'IHC, immunohistochemistry', 'IL-6, interleukin-6', 'MMSE, mini-mental status exam', 'NfL, neurofilament light chain', 'PBS, phosphate-buffered saline', 'PFA, paraformaldehyde', 'PLC, prelimbic cortex', 'ROI, regions of interest', 'SIMOA, single molecule array', 'Surgery', 'TRAP, Targeted Recombination in Active Populations', 'YKL-40', 'YKL-40, chitinase-3-like protein 1']","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2022-12-03,"[{'lastname': 'David-Bercholz', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Acker', 'firstname': 'Leah', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Caceres', 'firstname': 'Ana I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Pau Yen', 'initials': 'PY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Goenka', 'firstname': 'Saanvi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Franklin', 'firstname': 'Nathan O', 'initials': 'NO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Mouse Behavioral and Neuroendocrine Analysis Core Facility, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodriguiz', 'firstname': 'Ramona M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Mouse Behavioral and Neuroendocrine Analysis Core Facility, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wetsel', 'firstname': 'William C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Mouse Behavioral and Neuroendocrine Analysis Core Facility, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.\nDepartment of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.\nDepartment of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Devinney', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wright', 'firstname': 'Mary Cooter', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Zetterberg', 'firstname': 'Henrik', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Mölndal, Sweden.\nClinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Mölndal, Sweden.\nDepartment of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square, London, UK.\nUK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, London, UK.\nHong Kong Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Ting', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Berger', 'firstname': 'Miles', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Terrando', 'firstname': 'Niccolò', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.\nDepartment of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.\nDepartment of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.'}]",,,,© 2022 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100555

30385464",Systematic investigation of imprinted gene expression and enrichment in the mouse brain explored at single-cell resolution.,"Although a number of imprinted genes are known to be highly expressed in the brain, and in certain brain regions in particular, whether they are truly over-represented in the brain has never been formally tested. Using thirteen single-cell RNA sequencing datasets we systematically investigated imprinted gene over-representation at the organ, brain region, and cell-specific levels.
We established that imprinted genes are indeed over-represented in the adult brain, and in neurons particularly compared to other brain cell-types. We then examined brain-wide datasets to test enrichment within distinct brain regions and neuron subpopulations and demonstrated over-representation of imprinted genes in the hypothalamus, ventral midbrain, pons and medulla. Finally, using datasets focusing on these regions of enrichment, we identified hypothalamic neuroendocrine populations and the monoaminergic hindbrain neurons as specific hotspots of imprinted gene expression.
These analyses provide the first robust assessment of the neural systems on which imprinted genes converge. Moreover, the unbiased approach, with each analysis informed by the findings of the previous level, permits highly informed inferences about the functions on which imprinted gene expression converges. Our findings indicate the neuronal regulation of motivated behaviours such as feeding and sleep, alongside the regulation of pituitary function, as functional hotspots for imprinting. This adds statistical rigour to prior assumptions and provides testable predictions for novel neural and behavioural phenotypes associated with specific genes and imprinted gene networks. In turn, this work sheds further light on the potential evolutionary drivers of genomic imprinting in the brain.","['Genomic Imprinting', 'Imprinted Gene Network', 'Neuroendocrine', 'Single Cell Genomics']",BMC genomics,2022-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Higgs', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hill', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, UK Dementia Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'John', 'firstname': 'R M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Isles', 'firstname': 'A R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK. islesar1@cardiff.ac.uk.'}]",,,"We established that imprinted genes are indeed over-represented in the adult brain, and in neurons particularly compared to other brain cell-types.

22,36309985,Micromorphology of pineal gland calcification in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.,"The formation of concrements in human pineal gland (PG) is a physiological process and, according to many researchers, is associated with the involution of PG structures. The majority of scientific publications concern progressive calcification of PG, leaving out studies on the destruction of already formed calcified concrements. Our study fills the gap in knowledge about calcified zones destruction in PG in normal aging and neuropathological conditions, which has not been addressed until now.
Our objective is to gain insight into human PG tissue impairment in both normal aging and neurodegenerative conditions. X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) allowed us to study PG tissue degeneration at high spatial resolution and, for the first time, to examine the damaged PG concrements in detail. Our research finding could potentially enhance the understanding of the PG involvement in the process of aging as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD).
The research was carried out on human PG autopsy material in normal aging, VD, and AD conditions. Laboratory-based micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) was used to collect and evaluate samples of native, uncut, and unstained PG with different degrees of pineal calcification. The detailed high-resolution 3D images of the selected PGs were produced using synchrotron-based XPCT. Histology and immunohistochemistry of soft PG tissue confirmed XPCT results.
We performed via micro-CT the evaluation of the morphometric parameters of PG such as total sample volume, calcified concrements volume, and percentage of concrements in the total volume of the sample. XPCT imaging revealed high-resolution details of age-related PG alteration. In particular, we noted signs of moderate degradation of concrements in some PGs from elderly donors. In addition, our analysis revealed noticeable degenerative change in both concrements and soft tissue of PGs with neuropathology. In particular, we observed a hollow core and separated layers as well as deep ragged cracks in PG concrements of AD and VD samples. In parenchyma of some samples, we detected wide pinealocyte-free fluid-filled areas adjacent to the calcified zones.
The present work provides the basis for future scientific research focused on the dynamic nature of PG calcium deposits and PG soft tissue in normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases.","['X-ray phase-contrast tomography', 'histology', 'human pineal gland', 'microtomography', 'neurodegenerative diseases']",Medical physics,2022-10-31,"[{'lastname': 'Bukreeva', 'firstname': 'Inna', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology - CNR, Rome unit, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Junemann', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology - CNR, Rome unit, Rome, Italy.\nResearch Institute of Human Morphology, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Cedola', 'firstname': 'Alessia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology - CNR, Rome unit, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Brun', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Longo', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A., Basovizza, Trieste, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Tromba', 'firstname': 'Giuliana', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A., Basovizza, Trieste, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilde', 'firstname': 'Fabian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Materials Physics, Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, Geesthacht, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Chukalina', 'firstname': 'Marina V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Federal Scientific Research Center ""Crystallography and Photonics"" RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation.\nSmart Engines Service LLC, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Krivonosov', 'firstname': 'Yuri S', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Federal Scientific Research Center ""Crystallography and Photonics"" RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Dyachkova', 'firstname': 'Irina G', 'initials': 'IG', 'affiliation': 'Federal Scientific Research Center ""Crystallography and Photonics"" RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Buzmakov', 'firstname': 'Alexey V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Federal Scientific Research Center ""Crystallography and Photonics"" RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Zolotov', 'firstname': 'Denis A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Federal Scientific Research Center ""Crystallography and Photonics"" RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Palermo', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology - CNR, Rome unit, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gigli', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology - CNR, c/o Campus Ecotekne - Università del Salento via Monteroni, Lecce, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Otlyga', 'firstname': 'Dmitry A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of Human Morphology, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Saveliev', 'firstname': 'Sergey V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of Human Morphology, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}, {'lastname': 'Fratini', 'firstname': 'Michela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology - CNR, Rome unit, Rome, Italy.\nLaboratory of Neurophysics and Neuroimaging (NaN), IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Asadchikov', 'firstname': 'Victor E', 'initials': 'VE', 'affiliation': 'Federal Scientific Research Center ""Crystallography and Photonics"" RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}]",,The present work provides the basis for future scientific research focused on the dynamic nature of PG calcium deposits and PG soft tissue in normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases.,"We performed via micro-CT the evaluation of the morphometric parameters of PG such as total sample volume, calcified concrements volume, and percentage of concrements in the total volume of the sample.

21286840","Crosstalk of Alzheimer's disease-phenotype, HPA axis, splenic oxidative stress and frailty in late-stages of dementia, with special concerns on the effects of social isolation: A translational neuroscience approach.","Coping with emotional stressors strongly impacts older people due to their age-related impaired neuroendocrine and immune systems. Elevated cortisol levels seem to be associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), alterations in the innate immune system result in crosstalk between immune mediators and neuronal and endocrine functions. Besides, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or agitation are observed in most patients. Here, we studied the psychophysiological response to intrinsic (AD-phenotype) and extrinsic (anxiogenic tests) stress factors and their relation to liver, kidneys, heart, and spleen oxidative status in 18-months-old female gold-standard C57BL/6 mice and 3xTg-AD mice model for AD. The emotional, cognitive, and motor phenotypes were assessed under three different anxiogenic conditions. Survival, frailty index, and immunoendocrine status (corticosterone levels and oxidative stress of peripheral organs) were evaluated. Genotype differences in neuropsychiatric-like profiles and cognitive disfunction in 3xTg-AD females that survived beyond advanced stages of the disease persisted despite losing other behavioral and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) physiological differences. A secondary analysis studied the impact of social isolation, naturally occurring in 3xTg-AD mice due to the death of cage mates. One month of isolation modified hyperactivity and neophobia patterns and disrupt the obsessive-compulsive disorder-like digging ethogram. Frailty index correlated with spleen organometrics in all groups, whereas two AD-specific salient functional correlations were identified: (1) Levels of corticosterone with worse performance in the T-maze, (2) and with a lower splenic GPx antioxidant enzymatic activity, which may suppose a potent risk of morbidity and mortality in AD.","['3xTg-AD mice', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'aging', 'cognition', 'neuroimmunoendocrine crosstalk', 'neuropsychiatric symptoms', 'social isolation', 'translational neuroscience']",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Muntsant', 'firstname': 'Aida', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Neurociències, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Giménez-Llort', 'firstname': 'Lydia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Neurociències, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2022 Muntsant and Giménez-Llort.,"10.3389/fnagi.2022.969381

34739421",Towards an understanding of the pathological basis of senile depression and incident dementia: Implications for treatment.,"Senile depression (SD) is a heterogeneous syndrome. Several clinical profiles are more likely to appear in SD than in early-life depression, but it remains unclear whether the pathophysiology is different. The prevalence of dementia increases with aging, and the underlying pathophysiological processes in the preclinical phase begin even before cognitive deficits or neurological signs appear. SD may be either a risk factor for developing dementia or a prodromal stage of dementia. The inconsistent findings regarding the association between SD and incident dementia may be attributable to the neuropathological heterogeneity underlying SD. Most studies have focused on patients with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) as an outcome, but several clinicopathological studies suggest that primary age-related tauopathy and argyrophilic grain disease may account for a proportion of cases clinically misdiagnosed as AD in the elderly population. Furthermore, most AD cases have additional neuropathologic changes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Here, we review the neuropathological findings linking SD to incident dementia, focusing on common age-related neuropathologies. In particular, the roles of disturbance of neural circuity, imbalance of monoaminergic systems, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and elevated neuroinflammatory status are discussed. Finally, we review the current treatment of SD in the context of age-related neuropathological changes.","['Alzheimer disease', 'Lewy body disease', 'neuropathology', 'senile depression', 'tau']",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2022-10-03,"[{'lastname': 'Kawakami', 'firstname': 'Ito', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.\nDementia Research Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iga', 'firstname': 'Jun-Ichi', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Matsuyama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takahashi', 'firstname': 'Sho', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Disaster and Community Psychiatry, Division of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.\nDepartment of Community and Disaster Assistance, Ibaraki Prefectural Medical Research Center of Psychiatry, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Yi-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujishiro', 'firstname': 'Hiroshige', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.'}]",,,,"© 2022 The Authors.

17562829",Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and anxiety-like behavior during aging: A test of the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis in amyloidogenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, dementing, whole-body disorder that presents with decline in cognitive, behavioral, and emotional functions, as well as endocrine dysregulation. The etiology of AD is not fully understood but stress- and anxiety-related hormones may play a role in its development and trajectory. The glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis posits that levels of glucocorticoids increase with age, leading to dysregulated negative feedback, further elevated glucocorticoids, and resulting neuropathology. We examined the impact of age (from 2 to 10 months) and stressor exposure (predator odor) on hormone levels (corticosterone and ghrelin), anxiety-like behavior (open field and light dark tests), and memory-related behavior (novel object recognition; NOR), and whether these various measures correlated with neuropathology (hippocampus and cortex amyloid beta, Aβ) in male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Additionally, we performed exploratory analyses to probe if the open field and light dark test as commonly used tasks to assess anxiety levels were correlated. Consistent with the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis, baseline corticosterone increased with age. Predator odor exposure elevated corticosterone at each age, but in contrast to the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis, the magnitude of stressor-induced elevations in corticosterone levels did not increase with age. Overall, transgenic mice had higher post-stressor, but not baseline, corticosterone than non-transgenic mice, and across both genotypes, females consistently had higher (baseline and post-stressor) corticosterone than males. Behavior in the open field test primarily showed decreased locomotion with age, and this was pronounced in transgenic females. Anxiety-like behaviors in the light dark test were exacerbated following predator odor, and female transgenic mice were the most impacted. Compared to transgenic males, transgenic females had higher Aβ concentrations and showed more anxiety-like behavior. Performance on the NOR did not differ significantly between genotypes. Lastly, we did not find robust, statistically significant correlations among corticosterone, ghrelin, recognition memory, anxiety-like behaviors, or Aβ, suggesting outcomes are not strongly related on the individual level. Our data suggest that despite Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus and cortex, male and female APPswePS1dE9 transgenic mice do not differ robustly from their non-transgenic littermates in physiological, endocrine, and behavioral measures at the range of ages studied here.","['Aging', 'Anxiety', 'Between-task correlations', 'Corticosterone', 'Ghrelin', 'Predator odor', 'Within-task correlations']",General and comparative endocrinology,2022-09-20,"[{'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Breanna N', 'initials': 'BN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States.

27,35762404,"Digital histological morphometry of the human pineal gland in a postmortem study, with endocrine and neurological clinical implications.","The pineal gland is a small-sized, photo neuroendocrine organ in the midline of the brain that synthesises and secretes melatonin and serotonin. Chords and islands of pinealocytes constitute the secretory parenchyma, while glial tissue and calcifications represent degenerative changes. This study examined human postmortem pineal glands to microscopically assess morphological changes possibly associated with clinical data, by using digital techniques. A retrospective autopsy study has been performed on 72 paediatric and adult autopsy cases. The glands have been processed for histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining with synaptophysin (SYN), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and neurofilament (NF). Slides were digitally scanned. Morphometric data were obtained using CaseViewer and ImageJ. The comorbidities used for correlation with morphometric data were obesity, type 2 diabetes, adrenal gland adenoma, goitre, chronic pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, and mixed dementia. Thirty-three females and 39 males were included in the study. Increased secretory parenchyma was found in patients with chronic pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, and adrenal gland adenoma. Reduced activity was found in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, advanced pineal calcification, mixed dementia, and old age. There were no changes associated with goitre, cachexia, or Willis's polygon atherosclerosis. No significant differences between gender were found. The activity of the pineal gland can be assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry of neuroendocrine and structural pinealocyte markers and observation of glial tissue and calcifications. There is a need for further research to evaluate the clinical impact of these morphological changes on the neuroendocrine systems, with clinical implications in endocrinology, neurology, and even psychiatry. Digital techniques offer a more exact analysis of histological data.","['autopsy', 'histology', 'immunohistochemistry', 'morphometry', 'neuroendocrine', 'pineal gland']","Anatomia, histologia, embryologia",2022-06-29,"[{'lastname': 'Gheban', 'firstname': 'Bogdan-Alexandru', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Anatomic Pathology, Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.\nEmergency Clinical County Hospital Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Colosi', 'firstname': 'Horațiu Alexandru', 'initials': 'HA', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Medical Informatics and Biostatistics, Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Gheban-Roșca', 'firstname': 'Ioana-Andreea', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Medical Informatics and Biostatistics, Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Georgiu', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Anatomic Pathology, Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.\nEmergency Clinical County Hospital Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Gheban', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Dept. of Anatomic Pathology, Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.\nChildren's Emergency Clinical Hospital Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.""}, {'lastname': 'Crișan', 'firstname': 'Doinița', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Anatomic Pathology, Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.\nEmergency Clinical County Hospital Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Crișan', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Emergency Clinical County Hospital Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.\nDept. of Histology, Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.'}]",,,,© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.,10.1111/ahe.12828,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d940d4a0>

28410407",Bacterial Amyloid Curli Associated Gut Epithelial Neuroendocrine Activation Predominantly Observed in Alzheimer's Disease Mice with Central Amyloid-β Pathology.,"Substantial evidence from recent research suggests an influential and underappreciated force in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis: the pathological signals originate from outside the brain. Pathogenic bacteria produce amyloid-like proteins ""curli"" that form biofilms and show functional similarities to human amyloid-β (Aβ). These proteins may contribute to neurological disease progression via signaling cascade from the gut to the brain.
We propose that curli causes neuroendocrine activation from the gut to brain that promotes central Aβ pathology.
PGP9.5 and TLR2 levels in response to curli in the lumen of Tg2576 AD mice were analyzed by immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR analysis. Western blot and human 3D in vitro enteroids culture systems were also used. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate bacterial dysbiosis.
We found significant increase in bacterial-amyloid curli with elevated TLR2 at the mRNA level in the pre- and symptomatic Tg-AD gut compared to littermate WT controls. This data associates with increased gram-positive bacterial colonization in the ileum of the symptomatic AD mice. We found fundamental evidence for vagus nerve activation in response to bacterial curli. Neuroendocrine marker PGP9.5 was significantly elevated in the gut epithelium of symptomatic AD mice, and this was colocalized with increased TLR2 expression. Enteroids, 3D-human ileal mini-gut monolayer in vitro model system also revealed increase levels of TLR2 upon stimulation with purified bacterial curli fibrils.
These findings reveal the importance of pathological changes within the gut-vagus-brain signaling in response to luminal bacterial amyloid that might play a vital role in central Aβ pathogenesis seen in the AD brain.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'PGP9.5', 'TLR2', 'amyloid-β', 'bacterial amyloid', 'curli', 'dysbiosis', 'enteroendocrine cell', 'gut barrier', 'gut-brain axis', 'neuroendocrine', 'vagus nerve']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Das', 'firstname': 'Tushar K', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Blasco-Conesa', 'firstname': 'Maria P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Korf', 'firstname': 'Janelle', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Honarpisheh', 'firstname': 'Pedram', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chapman', 'firstname': 'Matthew R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ganesh', 'firstname': 'Bhanu P', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}]",,These findings reveal the importance of pathological changes within the gut-vagus-brain signaling in response to luminal bacterial amyloid that might play a vital role in central Aβ pathogenesis seen in the AD brain.,"We found significant increase in bacterial-amyloid curli with elevated TLR2 at the mRNA level in the pre- and symptomatic Tg-AD gut compared to littermate WT controls.

29,35465745,Feasibility of Hair Cortisol as a Biomarker of Chronic Stress in People With Dementia.,"Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are an innovative way to measure chronic stress relying on a small sample of hair. To date, there are no studies that have studied HCC as a biomarker of chronic stress in individuals with dementia. Given the vulnerability to chronic stress in people with dementia, using HCC as an objective measure of physiological stress in those with dementia has potential to enhance our understanding of this population. The goal of this exploratory, multidisciplinary, pilot study was to establish feasibility of HCC testing in people with dementia as a biomarker of chronic stress. HCC was examined over a 6-month period to assess physiological stress response during a transition to memory care.

12796141",Heart-brain interactions in cardiac and brain diseases: why sex matters.,"Cardiovascular disease and brain disorders, such as depression and cognitive dysfunction, are highly prevalent conditions and are among the leading causes limiting patient's quality of life. A growing body of evidence has shown an intimate crosstalk between the heart and the brain, resulting from a complex network of several physiological and neurohumoral circuits. From a pathophysiological perspective, both organs share common risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking or dyslipidaemia, and are similarly affected by systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and dysfunction of the neuroendocrine system. In addition, there is an increasing awareness that physiological interactions between the two organs play important roles in potentiating disease and that sex- and gender-related differences modify those interactions between the heart and the brain over the entire lifespan. The present review summarizes contemporary evidence of the effect of sex on heart-brain interactions and how these influence pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and treatment responses of specific heart and brain diseases.","['Brain', 'Dementia', 'Depression', 'Gender', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Ischaemic heart disease', 'Sex', 'Stroke', 'Takotsubo syndrome']",European heart journal,2022-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Rossi', 'firstname': 'Alexia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.\nCenter for Molecular Cardiology, University of Zurich, Schlieren, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Mikail', 'firstname': 'Nidaa', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.\nCenter for Molecular Cardiology, University of Zurich, Schlieren, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bengs', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.\nCenter for Molecular Cardiology, University of Zurich, Schlieren, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Haider', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.\nCenter for Molecular Cardiology, University of Zurich, Schlieren, Switzerland.\nDivision of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Treyer', 'firstname': 'Valerie', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Buechel', 'firstname': 'Ronny Ralf', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wegener', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rauen', 'firstname': 'Katrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Psychiatric Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.\nInstitute for Stroke and Dementia Research, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tawakol', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center, Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bairey Merz', 'firstname': 'C Noel', 'initials': 'CN', 'affiliation': ""Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center, Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.""}, {'lastname': 'Regitz-Zagrosek', 'firstname': 'Vera', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nUniversity of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gebhard', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.\nCenter for Molecular Cardiology, University of Zurich, Schlieren, Switzerland.'}]",,,,"© The Author(s) 2022.

30591954",DNA methylation in blood cells is associated with cortisol levels in offspring of mothers who had prenatal post-traumatic stress disorder.,"Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with differential DNA methylation in offspring and disrupted cortisol secretion. This study aimed to determine methylation signatures of cortisol levels in children, and whether associations differ based on maternal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Blood epigenome-wide methylation and fasting cortisol levels were measured in 118 offspring of mothers recruited from the Kosovo Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims. Mothers underwent clinically administered assessment for PTSD using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Correlations between offspring methylation and cortisol levels were examined using epigenome-wide analysis, adjusting for covariates. Subsequent analysis focussed on a priori selected genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress signalling. Methylation at four sites were correlated with cortisol levels (cg15321696, r = -0.33, cg18105800, r = +0.33, cg00986889, r = -0.25, and cg15920527, r = -0.27). In adjusted multivariable regression, when stratifying based on prenatal PTSD status, significant associations were only found for children born to mothers with prenatal PTSD (p < 0.001). Several sites within HPA axis genes were also associated with cortisol levels in the maternal PTSD group specifically. There is evidence that methylation is associated with cortisol levels, particularly in offspring born to mothers with prenatal PTSD. However, larger studies need to be carried out to independently validate these findings.","['BDNF', 'CRH', 'CRHR1/2', 'DNA methylation', 'FKBP5', 'NR3C1/2', 'cortisol', 'epigenetics', 'intergenerational', 'maternal PTSD', 'offspring', 'war']",Stress and health : journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress,2022-02-05,"[{'lastname': 'Fransquet', 'firstname': 'Peter Daniel', 'initials': 'PD', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Biological Neuropsychiatry and Dementia Unit, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hjort', 'firstname': 'Line', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Center for Pregnant Women with Diabetes, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Metabolic Epigenetics Group, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Rushiti', 'firstname': 'Feride', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Kosovo Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims, Pristina, Albania.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Shr-Jie', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Danish Institute Against Torture (DIGNITY), Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Krasniqi', 'firstname': 'Sebahate Pacolli', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Kosovo Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims, Pristina, Albania.'}, {'lastname': 'Çarkaxhiu', 'firstname': 'Selvi Izeti', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': 'Kosovo Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims, Pristina, Albania.'}, {'lastname': 'Arifaj', 'firstname': 'Dafina', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Kosovo Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims, Pristina, Albania.'}, {'lastname': 'Xhemaili', 'firstname': 'Vjosa Devaja', 'initials': 'VD', 'affiliation': 'Kosovo Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims, Pristina, Albania.'}, {'lastname': 'Salihu', 'firstname': 'Mimoza', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Kosovo Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims, Pristina, Albania.'}, {'lastname': 'Leku', 'firstname': 'Nazmie Abullahu', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Kosovo Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims, Pristina, Albania.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Biological Neuropsychiatry and Dementia Unit, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}]",,,,© 2022 The Authors.

32,35051644,Carving the senescent phenotype by the chemical reactivity of catecholamines: An integrative review.,"Macromolecules damaged by covalent modifications produced by chemically reactive metabolites accumulate in the slowly renewable components of living bodies and compromise their functions. Among such metabolites, catecholamines (CA) are unique, compared with the ubiquitous oxygen, ROS, glucose and methylglyoxal, in that their high chemical reactivity is confined to a limited set of cell types, including the dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons and their direct targets, which suffer from CA propensities for autoxidation yielding toxic quinones, and for Pictet-Spengler reactions with carbonyl-containing compounds, which yield mitochondrial toxins. The functions progressively compromised because of that include motor performance, cognition, reward-driven behaviors, emotional tuning, and the neuroendocrine control of reproduction. The phenotypic manifestations of the resulting disorders culminate in such conditions as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, hypertension, sarcopenia, and menopause. The reasons to suspect that CA play some special role in aging accumulated since early 1970-ies. Published reviews address the role of CA hazardousness in the development of specific aging-associated diseases. The present integrative review explores how the bizarre discrepancy between CA hazardousness and biological importance could have emerged in evolution, how much does the chemical reactivity of CA contribute to the senescent phenotype in mammals, and what can be done with it.","['Aging', 'Catecholamines', 'Circulatory system', 'Cognitive decline', 'Gonadotropins', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'Neuromelanin', 'Stem cell niches', 'Steroid hormones']",Ageing research reviews,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Golubev', 'firstname': 'Aleksei G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Carcinogenesis and Oncogerontology, N.N.

33,34933727,Melatonin hormone as a therapeutic weapon against neurodegenerative diseases.,"Brain disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (PD) are irreversible conditions with several cognitive problems, including learning disabilities, memory loss, movement abnormalities, and speech problems. These disorders are caused by a variety of factors, mainly due to the toxic pollutants-induced biochemical changes in protein production, uncontrolled neuronal electrical activity, and altered neurotransmitter levels. Oxidative stress and toxicity associated with the increased glutamate levels decreased acetylcholine levels, and brain inflammation is the main contributing factor. Melatonin hormone is considered one of the potent treatment approaches for neurodegenerative disorders. Melatonin is released from the pineal gland and has a critical role in brain function regulation. Membrane receptors, binding sites, and chemical interaction mediate hormonal actions having multiple phenotypic expressions. It acts as a neurodegenerative agent against some neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), PD, depression, and migraines. Melatonin inhibits neurotoxic pollutants-induced Tau protein hyperphosphorylation, especially in AD. Other pivotal features of melatonin are its anti-inflammatory properties, which decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and factors such as IL-8, IL-6, and TNF. Melatonin also reduces NO (an inflammation factor). In this review, we have highlighted the protective effects of melatonin, mainly spotlighting its neuroprotective mechanisms that will be beneficial to assess their effects in environmental pollution-induced neurodegenerative pathology.",[],"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",2021-12-23,"[{'lastname': 'Asefy', 'firstname': 'Zahra', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran. ftekhari@ymail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Khusro', 'firstname': 'Ameer', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research Department of Plant Biology and Biotechnology, Loyola College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India . ftekhari@ymail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Mammadova', 'firstname': 'Shakar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Geography, Baku State University, Baku, Azerbaijan. ftekhari@ymail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoseinnejhad', 'firstname': 'Sirus', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran. ftekhari@ymail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Eftekhari', 'firstname': 'Aziz', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran. ftekhari@ymail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Alghamdi', 'firstname': 'Saad', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, P.O.

32653555",Gut microbiota depletion from early adolescence alters anxiety and depression-related behaviours in male mice with Alzheimer-like disease.,"The gut-microbiota-brain axis plays an important role in stress-related disorders, and dysfunction of this complex bidirectional system is associated with Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to assess the idea that whether gut microbiota depletion from early adolescence can alter anxiety- and depression-related behaviours in adult mice with or without Alzheimer-like disease. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with an antibiotic cocktail from weaning to adulthood. Adult mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-beta (Aβ)1-42, and were subjected to anxiety and depression tests. We measured, brain malondialdehyde and glutathione following anxiety tests, and assessed brain oxytocin and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function by measuring adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone following depression tests. Healthy antibiotic-treated mice displayed significant decreases in anxiety-like behaviours, whereas they did not show any alterations in depression-like behaviours and HPA axis function. Antibiotic treatment from early adolescence prevented the development of anxiety- and depression-related behaviours, oxidative stress and HPA axis dysregulation in Alzheimer-induced mice. Antibiotic treatment increased oxytocin in the brain of healthy but not Alzheimer-induced mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that gut microbiota depletion following antibiotic treatment from early adolescence might profoundly affect anxiety- and depression-related behaviours, and HPA axis function in adult mice with Alzheimer-like disease.",[],Scientific reports,2021-11-27,"[{'lastname': 'Mosaferi', 'firstname': 'Belal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Sciences, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Jand', 'firstname': 'Yahya', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Salari', 'firstname': 'Ali-Akbar', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Salari Institute of Cognitive and Behavioral Disorders (SICBD), P.O.

30308413",Linking Diabetes Mellitus with Alzheimer's Disease: Bioinformatics Analysis for the Potential Pathways and Characteristic Genes.,"As the surging epidemics with significant disability, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with microvascular complications are widely prevalent, sharing considerable similarities in putative pathomechanism. Despite a spurt of researches on the biology, knowledge about their interactive mechanisms is still rudimentary. Applying bioinformatics ways to explore the differentially co-expressed genes contributes to achieve our objectives to find new therapeutic targets. In this study, we firstly integrated gene expression omnibus datasets (GSE28146 and GSE43950) to identify differentially expressed genes. The enrichment analysis of pivotal genes, like gene ontology and pathway signaling proceeded subsequently. Besides, the related protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was then constructed. To further explain the inner connections, we ended up unearthing the biological significance of valuable targets. As a result, a set of 712, 630, 487, and 997 genes were differentially identified in T2DM with microvascular complications and AD at incipient, moderate, and severe, respectively. The enrichment analysis involving both diseases implicated the dominance of immune system, especially the noteworthy chemokine signaling. Multiple comparisons confirmed that CACNA2D3, NUMB, and IER3 were simultaneously participate in these two conditions, whose respective associations with neurological and endocrine diseases, and regulators including interacting chemicals, transcription factors, and miRNAs were analyzed. Bioinformatics analysis eventually concluded that immune-related biological functions and pathways closely link AD and T2DM with microvascular complications. Further exploration of the regulatory factors about CACNA2D3, NUMB, and IER3 in neuroendocrine field may provide us a promising direction to discover potential strategies for the comorbidity status.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Bioinformatics analysis', 'Differentially expressed genes', 'Type II diabetes mellitus']",Biochemical genetics,2021-11-16,"[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Cheng', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.\nClinical Neuroscience Institute of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Juyu', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.\nClinical Neuroscience Institute of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wen', 'firstname': 'Xueyi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.\nClinical Neuroscience Institute of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Keshen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. likeshen1971@126.com.\nClinical Neuroscience Institute of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. likeshen1971@126.com.'}]",,,,"© 2021.

15486049",Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in male rats results in sustained HPA activation and hyperinsulinemia.,"Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is a spectrum of cognitive deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease, for which insulin resistance is a major risk factor. A major cause of VCID is chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Under stress, sustained hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activation can result in insulin resistance. Little is known about the effects of CCH on the HPA axis. We hypothesized that CCH causes sustained HPA activation and insulin resistance.

31325907","Hair glucocorticoids are associated with childhood adversity, depressive symptoms and reduced global and lobar grey matter in Generation Scotland.","Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation has been commonly reported in major depressive disorder (MDD), but with considerable heterogeneity of results; potentially due to the predominant use of acute measures of an inherently variable/phasic system. Chronic longer-term measures of HPA-axis activity have yet to be systematically examined in MDD, particularly in relation to brain phenotypes, and in the context of early-life/contemporaneous stress. Here, we utilise a temporally stable measure of cumulative HPA-axis function (hair glucocorticoids) to investigate associations between cortisol, cortisone and total glucocorticoids with concurrent measures of (i) lifetime-MDD case/control status and current symptom severity, (ii) early/current-life stress and (iii) structural neuroimaging phenotypes, in N = 993 individuals from Generation Scotland (mean age = 59.1 yrs). Increased levels of hair cortisol were significantly associated with reduced global and lobar brain volumes with reductions in the frontal, temporal and cingulate regions (β",[],Translational psychiatry,2021-10-14,"[{'lastname': 'Green', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. claire.green@ed.ac.uk.'}, {'lastname': 'Stolicyn', 'firstname': 'Aleks', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Mathew A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Xueyi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Romaniuk', 'firstname': 'Liana', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbu', 'firstname': 'Miruna C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hawkins', 'firstname': 'Emma L', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wardlaw', 'firstname': 'Joanna M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'UK Dementia Research Institute, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.\nCentre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Steele', 'firstname': 'J Douglas', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Imaging Science and Technology, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Waiter', 'firstname': 'Gordon D', 'initials': 'GD', 'affiliation': 'Aberdeen Biomedical Imaging Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sandu', 'firstname': 'Anca-Larisa', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Aberdeen Biomedical Imaging Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Archie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Porteous', 'firstname': 'David J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Seckl', 'firstname': 'Jonathan R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Lawrie', 'firstname': 'Stephen M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Reynolds', 'firstname': 'Rebecca M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Cavanagh', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, College of Medical and Veterinary Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'McIntosh', 'firstname': 'Andrew M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.\nCentre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Whalley', 'firstname': 'Heather C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}]",,,,© 2021.

31307034",Caregiver subjective and physiological markers of stress and patient heart failure severity in family care dyads.,"Greater family caregiver exposure to uncontrolled patient symptoms is predictive of greater caregiver psychological and physiological stress in dementia and other chronic illnesses, but these phenomena have not been well-studied in heart failure (HF) - a disease with high symptom burden. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that worse patient functional status (as reflected by increasing HF symptoms) would be associated with elevated psychological and physiological stress for the caregiver. This was a secondary analysis of data from 125 HF caregivers in the Caregiver Opportunities for Optimizing Lifestyle (COOL) study. Psychological stress was measured on four dimensions: care-related strain/burden (Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale), depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Index), and general stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Physiological stress was measured by markers of HPA axis function (elevated cortisol awakening response [CAR]), endothelial dysfunction (increased PAI-1), and inflammation (increased IL-6, hsCRP). HF patient functional status was quantified by caregiver assessment of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class. Generalized linear models were used to test associations between patient NYHA Class and stress (one model per indicator). NYHA Class (ordinal) was backwards difference coded in each model to examine caregiver stress in relation to increasing levels of HF severity. Caregivers were mostly female and in their mid-fifties, with a slight majority of the sample being African American and the patient's spouse. Overall, patient functional status was associated with greater caregiver psychological and physiological stress. In terms of psychological stress, higher NYHA Class was significantly associated with greater caregiver anxiety and general stress, but not with caregiver burden or depression. In terms of physiological stress, higher NYHA Class was associated with elevated markers in all models (elevated CAR and higher IL-6, hsCRP, and PAI-1). Across models, most associations between NYHA Class and stress were present at relatively early stages of functional limitation (i.e. Class II), while others emerged when functional limitations became more severe. To inform timing and mechanisms for much-needed caregiver interventions, research is needed to determine which aspects of HF symptomatology are most stressful for caregivers across the HF trajectory.","['Caregivers', 'Heart failure', 'Stress, physiological', 'Stress, psychological', 'Symptoms']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-09-06,"[{'lastname': 'Bidwell', 'firstname': 'Julie T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Family Caregiving Institute at the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing, University of California, Davis, 2570 48th Street, Sacramento, CA 95817, United States.

However, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms often precede the motor component and may be due to changes in the limbic system. Recent work has indicated pathology in the hypothalamus in HD but other parts of the limbic system have not been extensively studied. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in HD also include white matter pathology. Here we investigated if the main white matter tract of the limbic system, the fornix, is affected in HD. We demonstrate that the fornix is 34% smaller already in prodromal HD and 41% smaller in manifest HD compared to controls using volumetric analyses of MRI of the IMAGE-HD study. In post-mortem fornix tissue from HD cases, we confirm the smaller fornix volume in HD which is accompanied by signs of myelin breakdown and reduced levels of the transcription factor myelin regulating factor but detect no loss of oligodendrocytes. Further analyses using RNA-sequencing demonstrate downregulation of oligodendrocyte identity markers in the fornix of HD cases. Analysis of differentially expressed genes based on transcription-factor/target-gene interactions also revealed enrichment for binding sites of SUZ12 and EZH2, components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, as well as RE1 Regulation Transcription Factor. Taken together, our data show that there is early white matter pathology of the fornix in the limbic system in HD likely due to a combination of reduction in oligodendrocyte genes and myelin break down.","['Fornix', 'Huntingtin', 'MRI', 'Oligodendrocyte', 'RNA sequencing']",Acta neuropathologica,2021-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Gabery', 'firstname': 'Sanaz', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, BMC D11, 22184, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwa', 'firstname': 'Jing Eugene', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Translational Laboratory in Genetic Medicine (TLGM), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138648, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheong', 'firstname': 'Rachel Y', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, BMC D11, 22184, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Baldo', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, BMC D11, 22184, Lund, Sweden.\nEvotec SE, HD Research and Translational Sciences, 22419, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari Bardile', 'firstname': 'Costanza', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Translational Laboratory in Genetic Medicine (TLGM), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138648, Singapore.\nDepartment of Medical Genetics, British Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V5Z 4H4, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Brendan', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, 3180, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McLean', 'firstname': 'Catriona', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Georgiou-Karistianis', 'firstname': 'Nellie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, 3180, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Poudel', 'firstname': 'Govinda R', 'initials': 'GR', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, 3180, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Halliday', 'firstname': 'Glenda', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'The Brain and Mind Centre and Faculty of Medicine and Health, School of Medical Sciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pouladi', 'firstname': 'Mahmoud A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': ""Translational Laboratory in Genetic Medicine (TLGM), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138648, Singapore.\nDepartment of Medical Genetics, British Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V5Z 4H4, Canada.\nDepartment of Physiology, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, 117597, Singapore.""}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Åsa', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, BMC D11, 22184, Lund, Sweden. asa.petersen@med.lu.se.'}]",,,,© 2021.

41,34392773,Elevated levels of hair cortisol concentrations in professional dementia caregivers.,"Providing care for people with dementia can be a highly stressful profession. Hair Cortisol Concentration (HCC) levels have been used as a biological marker for HPA axis activity to demonstrate that informal caregivers of people with dementia could be vulnerable to chronic stress. The current study aimed to progress the findings of research conducted with informal caregivers and is the first study to assess HCC as a biological indicator of stress in professional carers of people with dementia. HCC levels were compared between 32 professional dementia caregivers (30 females with a mean age of 45.83 and 2 males with a mean age of 24.50), 45 employees working in higher education settings (42 females with a mean age of 38.66 and 3 males with a mean age of 31.89) and 88 undergraduate students (67 females with a mean age of 24.04 and 21 males with a mean age of 23.91). Analysis of HCC was used to assess HPA axis activity over 1 month. A one-way ANCOVA, with age and gender being included as covariates, revealed that higher levels of HCC were observed in professional dementia carers than people who worked within higher education settings and undergraduate students. The results indicated that professional dementia caregivers may experience stress to the extent of activating biological stress responses at a greater frequency in comparison to people who work in higher education and undergraduate students. However, no significant differences were observed in the perceived stress levels reported across dementia caregivers, professionals working in higher education, and undergraduate students. These findings highlight the requirement to ascertain the extent to which work-related tasks or other factors, specific to the profession of caring for people with dementia, could elicit heightened HPA stress reactivity.","['Dementia', 'carer', 'hair cortisol', 'occupation', 'stress', 'well-being']","Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2021-08-17,"[{'lastname': 'Rippon', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Health and Life Sciences, Department of Psychology, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'McDonnell', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Studio III Clinical Support Services, Alcester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bristow', 'firstname': 'Matt', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Science and Engineering, Division of Psychology, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'School of Health and Life Sciences, Department of Psychology, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'McCreadie', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Studio III Clinical Support Services, Alcester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wetherell', 'firstname': 'Mark A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'School of Health and Life Sciences, Department of Psychology, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}]",,,,,10.1080/10253890.2021.1968821,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8ca28b0>

18209732",Chronic stress induces NPD-like behavior in APPPS1 and WT mice with subtle differences in gene expression.,"Neuropsychiatric disturbances (NPDs) are considered hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, treatment of these symptoms has proven difficult and development of safe and effective treatment options is hampered by the limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Thus, robust preclinical models are needed to increase knowledge of NPDs in AD and develop testable hypotheses and novel treatment options. Abnormal activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is implicated in many psychiatric symptoms and might contribute to both AD and NPDs development and progression. We aimed to establish a mechanistic preclinical model of NPD-like behavior in the APPPS1 mouse model of AD and wildtype (WT) littermates. In APPPS1 and WT mice, we found that chronic stress increased anxiety-like behavior and altered diurnal locomotor activity suggestive of sleep disturbances. Also, chronic stress activated the HPA axis, which, in WT mice, remained heightened for additional 3 weeks. Chronic stress caused irregular expression of circadian regulatory clock genes (BMAL1, PER2, CRY1 and CRY2) in both APPPS1 and WT mice. Interestingly, APPPS1 and WT mice responded differently to chronic stress in terms of expression of serotonergic markers (5-HT","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'HPA axis', 'anxiety', 'chronic stress', 'neuropsychiatric disturbances', 'preclinical research model', 'sleep disturbances']","Genes, brain, and behavior",2021-08-13,"[{'lastname': 'Clement', 'firstname': 'Amalie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.\nDepartment of Pathology and Fluid Biomarkers, H.

43,34340133,Intact circadian rhythm despite cortisol hypersecretion in Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis.,"Hypersecretion of the glucocorticoid steroid hormone cortisol by individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been suspected for several decades, during which time dozens of examinations of this phenomenon have been conducted and published. The goals of this investigation were to summarize this sizeable body of literature, test whether participant and methodological characteristics modify the magnitude of the AD-associated basal cortisol hypersecretion, and examine whether cortisol circadian rhythmicity is maintained among individuals with AD. To this end, the present meta-analysis and systematic review examined over 300 comparisons of indices of basal HPA-axis functioning between individuals with AD and cognitively normal older adults. AD was associated with basal cortisol elevations (g = 0.45) but the magnitude of the effect was not systematically impacted by any of the participant characteristics considered or the time-of-day of the cortisol sampling. Further, there was no evidence of group differences among direct indices of circadian rhythmicity such as the cortisol awakening response or the diurnal cortisol slope. These results suggest that basal hypersecretion of cortisol, but not circadian dysrhythmia, is characteristic of individuals with AD. Mechanistically, the observed hypersecretion is consistent with the theorized AD-driven deterioration of the hippocampus and subsequent reduction in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis inhibition. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the role and timing of cortisol elevations in the progression of AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Circadian rhythm', 'Cortisol', 'HPA-axis', 'Meta-analysis']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-08-03,"[{'lastname': 'Saelzler', 'firstname': 'Ursula G', 'initials': 'UG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr. La Jolla, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.

44,34238481,Craniopharyngiomas primarily affecting the hypothalamus.,"The concept of craniopharyngiomas (CPs) primarily affecting the hypothalamus, or ""hypothalamic CPs"" (Hy-CPs), refers, in a restrictive sense, to the subgroup of CPs originally developing within the neural tissue of the infundibulum and tuber cinereum, the components of the third ventricle floor. This subgroup, also known as infundibulo-tuberal CPs, largely occupies the third ventricle and comprises up to 40% of this pathological entity. The small subgroup of strictly intraventricular CPs (5%), lesions wholly developed within the third ventricle above an anatomically intact third ventricle floor, can also be included within the Hy-CP category. The remaining types of sellar and/or suprasellar CPs may compress or invade the hypothalamic region during their growth but will not be considered in this review. Hy-CPs predominantly affect adults, causing a wide range of symptoms derived from hypothalamic dysfunction, such as adiposogenital dystrophy (Babinski-Fröhlich's syndrome), diabetes insipidus (DI), abnormal diurnal somnolence, and a complex set of cognitive (dementia-like, Korsakoff-like), emotional (rage, apathy, depression), and behavioral (autism-like, psychotic-like) disturbances. Accordingly, Hy-CPs represent a neurobiological model of psychiatric disorders caused by a lesion restricted to the hypothalamus. The vast majority (90%) of squamous-papillary CPs belong to the Hy-CP category. Pathologically, most Hy-CPs present extensive and strong adhesions to the surrounding hypothalamus, usually formed of a thick band of gliotic tissue encircling the central portion of the tumor (""ring-like"" attachment) or its entire boundary (""circumferential"" attachment). CPs with these severe adhesion types associate high surgical risk, with morbidity and mortality rates three times higher than those for sellar/suprasellar CPs. Consequently, radical surgical removal of Hy-CPs cannot be generally recommended. Rather, Hy-CPs should be accurately classified according to an individualized surgery-risk stratification scheme considering patient age, CP topography, presence of hypothalamic symptoms, tumor size, and, most importantly, the CP-hypothalamus adhesion pattern.","['Craniopharyngioma', 'Hypothalamic syndrome', 'Hypothalamus', 'Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome', 'Mamillary bodies', 'Median eminence', 'Pituitary infundibulum', 'Third ventricle', 'Tuber cinereum']",Handbook of clinical neurology,2021-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Pascual', 'firstname': 'José María', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, La Princesa University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.

29560886",Enduring glucocorticoid-evoked exacerbation of synaptic plasticity disruption in male rats modelling early Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis.,"Synaptic dysfunction is a likely proximate cause of subtle cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer's disease. Soluble oligomers are the most synaptotoxic forms of amyloid ß-protein (Aß) and mediate synaptic plasticity disruption in Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. Because the presence and extent of cortisol excess in prodromal Alzheimer's disease predicts the onset of cognitive symptoms we hypothesised that corticosteroids would exacerbate the inhibition of hippocampal synaptic long-term potentiation in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. In a longitudinal experimental design using freely behaving pre-plaque McGill-R-Thy1-APP male rats, three injections of corticosterone or the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone profoundly disrupted long-term potentiation induced by strong conditioning stimulation for at least 2 months. The same treatments had a transient or no detectible detrimental effect on synaptic plasticity in wild-type littermates. Moreover, corticosterone-mediated cognitive dysfunction, as assessed in a novel object recognition test, was more persistent in the transgenic animals. Evidence for the involvement of pro-inflammatory mechanisms was provided by the ability of the selective the NOD-leucine rich repeat and pyrin containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome inhibitor Mcc950 to reverse the synaptic plasticity deficit in corticosterone-treated transgenic animals. The marked prolongation of the synaptic plasticity disrupting effects of brief corticosteroid excess substantiates a causal role for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation in early Alzheimer's disease.",[],Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2021-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Qi', 'firstname': 'Yingjie', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College, Dublin, 2, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Klyubin', 'firstname': 'Igor', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College, Dublin, 2, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ondrejcak', 'firstname': 'Tomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College, Dublin, 2, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Neng-Wei', 'initials': 'NW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College, Dublin, 2, Ireland.\nDepartment of Physiology and Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Science Avenue, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Rowan', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College, Dublin, 2, Ireland. mrowan@tcd.ie.'}]",,,,© 2021.

46,34159699,"Chronic stress and Alzheimer's disease: the interplay between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, genetics and microglia.","Chronic psychosocial stress is increasingly being recognised as a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) is the major stress response pathway in the body and tightly regulates the production of cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone. Dysregulation of the HPA axis and increased levels of cortisol are commonly found in AD patients and make a major contribution to the disease process. The underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In addition, within the general population there are interindividual differences in sensitivities to glucocorticoid and stress responses, which are thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. These differences could ultimately impact an individuals' risk of AD. The purpose of this review is first to summarise the literature describing environmental and genetic factors that can impact an individual's HPA axis reactivity and function and ultimately AD risk. Secondly, we propose a mechanism by which genetic factors that influence HPA axis reactivity may also impact inflammation, a key driver of neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that these factors can mediate glucocorticoid priming of the immune cells of the brain, microglia, to become pro-inflammatory and promote a neurotoxic environment resulting in neurodegeneration. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and identifying these genetic factors has implications for evaluating stress-related risk/progression to neurodegeneration, informing the success of interventions based on stress management and potential risks associated with the common use of glucocorticoids.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'HPA axis reactivity', 'chronic stress', 'cortisol', 'glucocorticoids', 'microglia', 'neuroinflammation']",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,2021-06-24,"[{'lastname': 'Milligan Armstrong', 'firstname': 'Ayeisha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nCurtin Medical School, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Porter', 'firstname': 'Tenielle', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Curtin Medical School, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nCollaborative Genomics and Translation Group, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, 270 Joondalup Drive, Joondalup, WA, 6027, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Quek', 'firstname': 'Hazel', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Institute, 300 Herston Rd, Herston, QLD, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'White', 'firstname': 'Anthony', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Institute, 300 Herston Rd, Herston, QLD, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Haynes', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jackaman', 'firstname': 'Connie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nCurtin Medical School, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Villemagne', 'firstname': 'Victor', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, 270 Joondalup Drive, Joondalup, WA, 6027, Australia.\nThe Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, 30 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Munyard', 'firstname': 'Kylie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nCurtin Medical School, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Laws', 'firstname': 'Simon M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Curtin Medical School, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nCollaborative Genomics and Translation Group, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, 270 Joondalup Drive, Joondalup, WA, 6027, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Verdile', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nCurtin Medical School, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nSchool of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, 270 Joondalup Drive, Joondalup, WA, 6027, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Groth', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.\nCurtin Medical School, Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, WA, 6102, Australia.'}]",,,,© 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.,10.1111/brv.12750,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db5e4b80>

48,34061772,Altered endocannabinoid-dynamics in craniopharyngioma patients and their association with HPA-axis disturbances.,"Patients with craniopharyngioma (CP) frequently suffer from morbid obesity. Endocannabinoids (ECs) are involved in weight gain and rewarding behavior but have not been investigated in this context.
Cross-sectional single-center study.
Eighteen patients with CP and 16 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Differences in endocannabinoids (2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA)) and endocannabinoid-like molecules (oleoyl ethanolamide (OEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and arachidonic acid (AA) were measured at baseline and following endurance exercise. We further explored ECs-dynamics in relation to markers of HPA-axis activity (ACTH, cortisol, copeptin) and hypothalamic damage.
Under resting conditions, independent of differences in BMI, 2-AG levels were more than twice as high in CP patients compared to controls. In contrast, 2-AG and OEA level increased in response to exercise in controls but not in CP patients, while AEA levels decreased in controls. As expected, exercise increased ACTH and copeptin levels in controls only. In a mixed model analysis across time and group, HPA measures did not provide additional information for explaining differences in 2-AG levels. However, AEA levels were negatively influenced by ACTH and copeptin levels, while OEA levels were negatively predicted by copeptin levels only. There were no significant differences in endocannabinoids depending on hypothalamic involvement.
Patients with CP show signs of a dysregulated endocannabinoid system under resting conditions as well as following exercise in comparison to healthy controls. Increased 2-AG levels under resting conditions and the missing response to physical activity could contribute to the metabolic phenotype of CP patients.",[],European journal of endocrinology,2021-06-02,"[{'lastname': 'Auer', 'firstname': 'Matthias K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität München, LMU München, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gebert', 'firstname': 'Dorothea', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Research Group Clinical Neuroendocrinology, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Biedermann', 'firstname': 'Sarah V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.\nHuman Behavior Laboratory, Institute for Sex Research and Forensic Psychiatry, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bindila', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stalla', 'firstname': 'Günter', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität München, LMU München, Munich, Germany.\nMedicover Neuroendocrinology, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reisch', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität München, LMU München, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kopczak', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuss', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Human Behavior Laboratory, Institute for Sex Research and Forensic Psychiatry, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.'}]",,Patients with CP show signs of a dysregulated endocannabinoid system under resting conditions as well as following exercise in comparison to healthy controls.

26017579",Systemic manifestation and contribution of peripheral tissues to Huntington's disease pathogenesis.,"Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that is caused by expansion of cytosine/adenosine/guanine repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which leads to a toxic, aggregation-prone, mutant HTT-polyQ protein. Beyond the well-established mechanisms of HD progression in the central nervous system, growing evidence indicates that also peripheral tissues are affected in HD and that systemic signaling originating from peripheral tissues can influence the progression of HD in the brain. Herein, we review the systemic manifestation of HD in peripheral tissues, and the impact of systemic signaling on HD pathogenesis. Mutant HTT induces a body wasting syndrome (cachexia) primarily via its activity in skeletal muscle, bone, adipose tissue, and heart. Additional whole-organism effects induced by mutant HTT include decline in systemic metabolic homeostasis, which stems from derangement of pancreas, liver, gut, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and circadian functions. In addition to spreading via the bloodstream and a leaky blood brain barrier, HTT-polyQ may travel long distance via its uptake by neurons and its axonal transport from the peripheral to the central nervous system. Lastly, signaling factors that are produced and/or secreted in response to therapeutic interventions such as exercise or in response to mutant HTT activity in peripheral tissues may impact HD. In summary, these studies indicate that HD is a systemic disease that is influenced by intertissue signaling and by the action of pathogenic HTT in peripheral tissues. We propose that treatment strategies for HD should include the amelioration of HD symptoms in peripheral tissues. Moreover, harnessing signaling between peripheral tissues and the brain may provide a means for reducing HD progression in the central nervous system.","['Ageing', 'Huntington’s disease', 'Intertissue signaling', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Peripheral tissues']",Ageing research reviews,2021-05-13,"[{'lastname': 'Chuang', 'firstname': 'Chia-Lung', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Demontis', 'firstname': 'Fabio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.

12603289",Pathophysiological Bases of Comorbidity in Migraine.,"Despite that it is commonly accepted that migraine is a disorder of the nervous system with a prominent genetic basis, it is comorbid with a plethora of medical conditions. Several studies have found bidirectional comorbidity between migraine and different disorders including neurological, psychiatric, cardio- and cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, metaboloendocrine, and immunological conditions. Each of these has its own genetic load and shares some common characteristics with migraine. The bidirectional mechanisms that are likely to underlie this extensive comorbidity between migraine and other diseases are manifold. Comorbid pathologies can induce and promote thalamocortical network dysexcitability, multi-organ transient or persistent pro-inflammatory state, and disproportionate energetic needs in a variable combination, which in turn may be causative mechanisms of the activation of an ample defensive system with includes the trigeminovascular system in conjunction with the neuroendocrine hypothalamic system. This strategy is designed to maintain brain homeostasis by regulating homeostatic needs, such as normal subcortico-cortical excitability, energy balance, osmoregulation, and emotional response. In this light, the treatment of migraine should always involves a multidisciplinary approach, aimed at identifying and, if necessary, eliminating possible risk and comorbidity factors.","['CNS disorders', 'energetic balance', 'migraine threshold', 'thalamocortical network dysexcitability', 'trigeminovascular system']",Frontiers in human neuroscience,2021-05-08,"[{'lastname': 'Altamura', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Headache and Neurosonology Unit, Neurology, Campus Bio-Medico University Hospital, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Corbelli', 'firstname': 'Ilenia', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Clinica Neurologica, Dipartimento di Medicina, Ospedale S.M.

31383855",Dysbiosis and Alzheimer's Disease: A Role for Chronic Stress?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable, neuropsychiatric, pathological condition that deteriorates the worth of geriatric lives. AD is characterized by aggregated senile amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, gliosis, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and bioenergetic deficits. The changes in GIT composition and harmony have been recognized as a decisive and interesting player in neuronal pathologies including AD. Microbiota control and influence the oxidoreductase status, inflammation, immune system, and the endocrine system through which it may have an impact on the cognitive domain. The altered and malfunctioned state of microbiota is associated with minor infections to complicated illnesses that include psychosis and neurodegeneration, and several studies show that microbiota regulates neuronal plasticity and neuronal development. The altered state of microbiota (dysbiosis) may affect behavior, stress response, and cognitive functions. Chronic stress-mediated pathological progression also has a well-defined role that intermingles at various physiological levels and directly impacts the pathological advancement of AD. Chronic stress-modulated alterations affect the well-established pathological markers of AD but also affect the gut-brain axis through the mediation of various downstream signaling mechanisms that modulate the microbial commensals of GIT. The extensive literature reports that chronic stressors affect the composition, metabolic activities, and physiological role of microbiota in various capacities. The present manuscript aims to elucidate mechanistic pathways through which stress induces dysbiosis, which in turn escalates the neuropathological cascade of AD. The stress-dysbiosis axis appears a feasible zone of work in the direction of treatment of AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'HPA Axis', 'chronic stress', 'glucocorticoids', 'microbiota', 'probiotics']",Biomolecules,2021-05-06,"[{'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Vivek Kumar', 'initials': 'VK', 'affiliation': 'Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab 140401, India.\nGoverment College of Pharmacy, District Shimla, Rohru 171207, Himachal Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Thakur Gurjeet', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab 140401, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Garg', 'firstname': 'Nikhil', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab 140401, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Dhiman', 'firstname': 'Sonia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab 140401, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Saurabh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab 140401, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Rahman', 'firstname': 'Md Habibur', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Southeast University, Banani, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Najda', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Quality of Vegetables and Medicinal Plants, Department of Vegetable Crops and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, 15 Akademicka Street, 20-950 Lublin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Walasek-Janusz', 'firstname': 'Magdalena', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Quality of Vegetables and Medicinal Plants, Department of Vegetable Crops and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, 15 Akademicka Street, 20-950 Lublin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamel', 'firstname': 'Mohamed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, Giza 12211, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Albadrani', 'firstname': 'Ghadeer M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, College of Science, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh 11474, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Akhtar', 'firstname': 'Muhammad Furqan', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Riphah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Riphah International University, Lahore Campus, Lahore 54950, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saleem', 'firstname': 'Ammara', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Altyar', 'firstname': 'Ahmed E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, P.O.

22048062",The connections of Locus Coeruleus with hypothalamus: potential involvement in Alzheimer's disease.,"The hypothalamus and Locus Coeruleus (LC) share a variety of functions, as both of them take part in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle and in the modulation of autonomic and homeostatic activities. Such a functional interplay takes place due to the dense and complex anatomical connections linking the two brain structures. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the occurrence of endocrine, autonomic and sleep disturbances have been associated with the disruption of the hypothalamic network; at the same time, in this disease, the occurrence of LC degeneration is receiving growing attention for the potential roles it may have both from a pathophysiological and pathogenetic point of view. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the anatomical and functional connections between the LC and hypothalamus, to better understand whether the impairment of the former may be responsible for the pathological involvement of the latter, and whether the disruption of their interplay may concur to the pathophysiology of AD. Although only a few papers specifically explored this topic, intriguingly, some pre-clinical and post-mortem human studies showed that aberrant protein spreading and neuroinflammation may cause hypothalamus degeneration and that these pathological features may be linked to LC impairment. Moreover, experimental studies in rodents showed that LC plays a relevant role in modulating the hypothalamic sleep/wake cycle regulation or neuroendocrine and systemic hormones; in line with this, the degeneration of LC itself may partly explain the occurrence of hypothalamic-related symptoms in AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Autonomic system', 'Hypothalamus', 'Locus Coeruleus', 'Neurodegenerative disorders', 'Noradrenaline', 'Sleep']","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2021-05-05,"[{'lastname': 'Giorgi', 'firstname': 'Filippo Sean', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Galgani', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Neurology Unit, Pisa University Hospital, 56126, Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Puglisi-Allegra', 'firstname': 'Stefano', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'I.R.C.C.S.

29701831",Multi-ancestry genome-wide gene-sleep interactions identify novel loci for blood pressure.,"Long and short sleep duration are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP), possibly through effects on molecular pathways that influence neuroendocrine and vascular systems. To gain new insights into the genetic basis of sleep-related BP variation, we performed genome-wide gene by short or long sleep duration interaction analyses on four BP traits (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure) across five ancestry groups in two stages using 2 degree of freedom (df) joint test followed by 1df test of interaction effects. Primary multi-ancestry analysis in 62,969 individuals in stage 1 identified three novel gene by sleep interactions that were replicated in an additional 59,296 individuals in stage 2 (stage 1 + 2

29991138",Gut Microbiota Composition and Epigenetic Molecular Changes Connected to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathogenesis is not fully known. Although there are several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, none of them completely explain the origin and progression of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and epigenetics can directly influence the pathogenesis of AD via their effects on multiple pathways, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid protein. Various gut microbes such as Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, E. coli, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and Verrucomicrobia are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. These microbes and their metabolites modulate various physiological processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis, such as neuroinflammation and other inflammatory processes, amyloid deposition, cytokine storm syndrome, altered BDNF and NMDA signaling, impairing neurodevelopmental processes. Likewise, epigenetic markers associated with AD mainly include histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are under the direct control of a variety of enzymes, such as acetylases and methylases. The activity of these enzymes is dependent upon the metabolites generated by the host's gut microbiome, suggesting the significance of epigenetics in AD pathogenesis. It is interesting to know that both gut microbiota and epigenetics are dynamic processes and show a high degree of variation according to diet, stressors, and environmental factors. The bidirectional relation between the gut microbiota and epigenetics suggests that they might work in synchrony to modulate AD representation, its pathogenesis, and progression. They both also provide numerous targets for early diagnostic biomarkers and for the development of AD therapeutics. This review discusses the gut microbiota and epigenetics connection in the pathogenesis of AD and aims to highlight vast opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutics of AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'CNS complications', 'Epigenetics', 'Gut microbiota', 'Gut–brain axis', 'Pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease']",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,2021-04-09,"[{'lastname': 'Nagu', 'firstname': 'Priyanka', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Govt.

22722776",Clinical application of intrathecal gadobutrol for assessment of cerebrospinal fluid tracer clearance to blood.,"BACKGROUNDMethodology for estimation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracer clearance could have wide clinical application in predicting excretion of intrathecal drugs and metabolic solutes from brain metabolism and for diagnostic workup of CSF disturbances.METHODSThe MRI contrast agent gadobutrol (Gadovist) was used as a CSF tracer and injected into the lumbar CSF. Gadobutrol is contained outside blood vessels of the CNS and is eliminated along extravascular pathways, analogous to many CNS metabolites and intrathecal drugs. Tracer enrichment was verified and assessed in CSF by MRI at the level of the cisterna magna in parallel with obtaining blood samples through 48 hours.RESULTSIn a reference patient cohort (n = 29), both enrichment within CSF and blood coincided in time. Blood concentration profiles of gadobutrol through 48 hours varied between patients diagnosed with CSF leakage (n = 4), idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus dementia (n = 7), pineal cysts (n = 8), and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (n = 4).CONCLUSIONAssessment of CSF tracer clearance is clinically feasible and may provide a way to predict extravascular clearance of intrathecal drugs and endogenous metabolites from the CNS. The peak concentration in blood (at about 10 hours) was preceded by far peak tracer enhancement at MRI in extracranial lymphatic structures (at about 24 hours), as shown in previous studies, indicating a major role of the spinal canal in CSF clearance capacity.FUNDINGThe work was supported by the Department of Neurosurgery, Oslo University Hospital; the Norwegian Institute for Air Research; and the University of Oslo.","['Alzheimer disease', 'Diagnostics', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Neuroscience']",JCI insight,2021-04-07,"[{'lastname': 'Eide', 'firstname': 'Per K', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Mariussen', 'firstname': 'Espen', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Institute for Air Research, Kjeller, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Uggerud', 'firstname': 'Hilde', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Institute for Air Research, Kjeller, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Pripp', 'firstname': 'Are H', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'Oslo Centre of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Research Support Services.'}, {'lastname': 'Lashkarivand', 'firstname': 'Aslan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Hassel', 'firstname': 'Bjørnar', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Neurohabilitation, and.'}, {'lastname': 'Christensen', 'firstname': 'Hege', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Section for Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Department of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Hovd', 'firstname': 'Markus Herberg', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Section for Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Department of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Ringstad', 'firstname': 'Geir', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,,,,"10.1172/jci.insight.147063

19734441",Laboratory-Supported Multiple System Atrophy beyond Autonomic Function Testing and Imaging: A Systematic Review by the MoDiMSA Study Group.,"Neuroimaging has been used to support a diagnosis of possible multiple system atrophy (MSA). Only blood pressure changes upon standing are included in the second consensus criteria but other autonomic function tests (AFT) are also useful to diagnose widespread and progressive autonomic failure typical of MSA. Additional diagnostic tools are of interest to improve accuracy of MSA diagnosis.
To assess the utility of diagnostic tools beyond brain imaging and AFT in enhancing a laboratory-supported diagnosis of MSA to support the upcoming revision of the consensus criteria.
The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society MSA Study Group (MoDiMSA) performed a systematic review of original papers on biomarkers, sleep studies, genetic, neuroendocrine, neurophysiological, neuropsychological and other tests including olfactory testing and acute levodopa challenge test published before August 2019.
Evaluation of history of levodopa responsiveness and olfaction is useful in patients in whom MSA-parkinsonian subtype is suspected. Neuropsychological testing is useful to exclude dementia at time of diagnosis. Applicability of sphincter EMG is limited. When MSA-cerebellar subtype is suspected, a screening for the common causes of adult-onset progressive ataxia is useful, including spinocerebellar ataxias in selected patients. Diagnosing stridor and REM sleep behavior disorder is useful in both MSA subtypes. However, none of these tools are validated in large longitudinal cohorts of postmortem confirmed MSA cases.
Despite limited evidence, additional laboratory work-up of patients with possible MSA beyond imaging and AFT should be considered to optimize the clinical diagnostic accuracy.","['diagnostic tests', 'multiple system atrophy']",Movement disorders clinical practice,2021-04-06,"[{'lastname': 'Stankovic', 'firstname': 'Iva', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Neurology Clinic, Clinical Center of Serbia, School of Medicine University of Belgrade Belgrade Serbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fanciulli', 'firstname': 'Alessandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Medical University of Innsbruck Innsbruck Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kostic', 'firstname': 'Vladimir S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Neurology Clinic, Clinical Center of Serbia, School of Medicine University of Belgrade Belgrade Serbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Krismer', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Medical University of Innsbruck Innsbruck Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Meissner', 'firstname': 'Wassilios G', 'initials': 'WG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology for Neurodegenerative Diseases, French Reference Center for MSA University Hospital Bordeaux Bordeaux France.\nInstitute of Neurodegenerative Diseases, University Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5293 Bordeaux France.\nDepartment of Medicine University of Otago Christchurch New Zealand.\nNew Zealand Brain Research Institute Christchurch New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Palma', 'firstname': 'Jose Alberto', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dysautonomia Center, Langone Medical Center New York University School of Medicine New York New York USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Panicker', 'firstname': 'Jalesh N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'UCL Institute of Neurology London United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Uro-Neurology The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery London United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Seppi', 'firstname': 'Klaus', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Medical University of Innsbruck Innsbruck Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Wenning', 'firstname': 'Gregor K', 'initials': 'GK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Medical University of Innsbruck Innsbruck Austria.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Evaluation of history of levodopa responsiveness and olfaction is useful in patients in whom MSA-parkinsonian subtype is suspected.

57,33786903,Insulin as a neuroendocrine hormone.,"The year 2021 marks 100 years since the discovery of insulin and this Special Issue of the Journal of Neuroendocrinology was conceived as a way to mark that historic breakthrough. The discovery of insulin and its subsequent use in the treatment of diabetes is one of the most striking success stories in biomedical research. From a neuroendocrinology perspective, the recognition that insulin also exerts widespread and varied actions in the brain is more recent, but potentially also of equal importance with relevance for conditions ranging from obesity to dementia. The reviews contained in this Special Issue were selected to cover the range of known actions of insulin in neuroendocrine function, and also to highlight areas where further understanding of insulin actions in the brain hold great promise for further improvements in human health.",[],Journal of neuroendocrinology,2021-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Grattan', 'firstname': 'David R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuroendocrinology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrews', 'firstname': 'Zane B', 'initials': 'ZB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.'}]",,,,© 2021 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/jne.12966,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db73d0e0>

18697911",Hormonal and Metabolic Changes of Aging and the Influence of Lifestyle Modifications.,"Increased life expectancy combined with the aging baby boomer generation has resulted in an unprecedented global expansion of the elderly population. The growing population of older adults and increased rate of age-related chronic illness has caused a substantial socioeconomic burden. The gradual and progressive age-related decline in hormone production and action has a detrimental impact on human health by increasing risk for chronic disease and reducing life span. This article reviews the age-related decline in hormone production, as well as age-related biochemical and body composition changes that reduce the bioavailability and actions of some hormones. The impact of hormonal changes on various chronic conditions including frailty, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia are also discussed. Hormone replacement therapy has been attempted in many clinical trials to reverse and/or prevent the hormonal decline in aging to combat the progression of age-related diseases. Unfortunately, hormone replacement therapy is not a panacea, as it often results in various adverse events that outweigh its potential health benefits. Therefore, except in some specific individual cases, hormone replacement is not recommended. Rather, positive lifestyle modifications such as regular aerobic and resistance exercise programs and/or healthy calorically restricted diet can favorably affect endocrine and metabolic functions and act as countermeasures to various age-related diseases. We provide a critical review of the available data and offer recommendations that hopefully will form the groundwork for physicians/scientists to develop and optimize new endocrine-targeted therapies and lifestyle modifications that can better address age-related decline in heath.",[],Mayo Clinic proceedings,2021-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'Pataky', 'firstname': 'Mark W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, and Nutrition, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.'}, {'lastname': 'Young', 'firstname': 'William F', 'initials': 'WF', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, and Nutrition, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.'}, {'lastname': 'Nair', 'firstname': 'K Sreekumaran', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, and Nutrition, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

16151880",Cohort profile: the Dutch famine birth cohort (DFBC)- a prospective birth cohort study in the Netherlands.,"The Dutch famine birth cohort study was set up to investigate the effects of acute maternal undernutrition of the 1944-1945 Dutch famine during the specific stages of gestation on later health, with a particular focus on chronic cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, ageing and mental health.
The Dutch famine birth cohort consists of 2414 singletons born alive and at term in the Wilhelmina Gasthuis in Amsterdam around the time of the Dutch famine (1943-1947) whose birth records have been kept. The cohort has been traced and studied since 1994, when the first data collection started. The cohort has been interviewed and physically examined in several waves of data collection since that time, allowing repeated measures of a wide range of phenotypic information as well as the collection of biological samples (blood, urine, buccal swabs), functional testing (of heart, lungs, kidney, HPA axis) and imaging of the brain (MRI) and vasculature (ultrasound). Additionally, genetic and epigenetic information was collected. Through linkage with registries, mortality and morbidity information of the entire cohort has been obtained.
Prenatal famine exposure had lasting consequences for health in later life. The effects of famine depended on its timing during the gestation and the organs and tissues developing at that time, with most effects after exposure to famine in early gestation. The effects of famine were widespread and affected the structure and function of many organs and tissues, resulted in altered behaviour and increased risks of chronic degenerative diseases and increased mortality. The effects of famine were independent of size at birth, which suggests that programming may occur without altering size at birth.
As the cohort ages, we will be assessing the effects of prenatal undernutrition on (brain) ageing, cognitive decline and dementia, as well as overall morbidity and mortality.
The Dutch famine birth cohort is not linked to a clinical trial.","['epidemiology', 'nutrition & dietetics', 'public health']",BMJ open,2021-03-06,"[{'lastname': 'Bleker', 'firstname': 'Laura S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology and Data Science, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Rooij', 'firstname': 'Susanne R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology and Data Science, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands s.r.derooij@amsterdamumc.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'Painter', 'firstname': 'Rebecca C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ravelli', 'firstname': 'Anita Cj', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Medical Informatics; Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Roseboom', 'firstname': 'Tessa J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology and Data Science; Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

23973293",The Role of Hypothalamic Inflammation in Diet-Induced Obesity and Its Association with Cognitive and Mood Disorders.,"Obesity is often associated with cognitive and mood disorders. Recent evidence suggests that obesity may cause hypothalamic inflammation. Our aim was to investigate the hypothesis that there is a causal link between obesity-induced hypothalamic inflammation and cognitive and mood disorders. Inflammation may influence hypothalamic inter-connections with regions important for cognition and mood, while it may cause dysregulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and influence monoaminergic systems. Exercise, healthy diet, and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists, which can reduce hypothalamic inflammation in obese models, could improve the deleterious effects on cognition and mood.","['cognitive disorders', 'dementia', 'depression', 'diet', 'hypothalamic inflammation', 'mood disorders', 'obesity']",Nutrients,2021-02-07,"[{'lastname': 'Dionysopoulou', 'firstname': 'Sofia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, Hippocratio General Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Charmandari', 'firstname': 'Evangelia', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, First Department of Pediatrics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 'Aghia Sophia' Children's Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.\nDivision of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Center for Clinical, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Bargiota', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, University Hospital of Larisa, Medical School of Larisa, University of Thessaly, 41334 Larisa, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Vlahos', 'firstname': 'Nikolaos', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': '2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Areteion University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Mastorakos', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine Unit, Areteion University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Valsamakis', 'firstname': 'Georgios', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, University Hospital of Larisa, Medical School of Larisa, University of Thessaly, 41334 Larisa, Greece.\nEndocrine Unit, Areteion University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/nu13020498

61,33497696,Psychobiological mechanisms underlying the health-beneficial effects of music in people living with dementia: A systematic review of the literature.,"Music has been used as agent in medicine for decades. The applications of music in health span from music therapy to music listening interventions to mere music listening. Music may reduce stress and improve health in people living with dementia (PwD), but the exact underpinnings of these effects are unclear. It is proposed that beneficial effects of music are mediated by a reduction in psychobiological stress. Therefore, the present review aims to shed light on the potential psychobiological mechanisms underlying the health-beneficial effects of music in PwD.
We searched for studies investigating health-beneficial effects of music in PwD by means of psychobiological stress measures using the PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and by hand-searching.
The inclusion criteria were met by 12 studies. Seven of the included studies investigated effects of music therapy on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or the immune system in patients with mild to moderate dementia. Results showed decreased ANS activity as measured by heart rate variability but no effect on alpha-amylase. Effects on blood pressure were mixed. Concerning the secretion of cortisol, one study found decreased HPA axis activity whereas two studies found no significant effects. No effects were found on salivary immunoglobin A. Three studies investigated the effects of music listening interventions in patients with severe dementia by means of predominantly ANS parameters with evidence indicating increased parasympathetic activation after music listening. Two studies investigated the effects of mere music listening on skin conductance using experimental designs. One study found increases in arousal due to music listening, whereas the other study found no effect.
These very preliminary results indicate effects of music on central stress pathways in PwD, but also highlight the need for further research focussing on a comprehensive assessment of autonomic, endocrine and immunological parameters in response to music. Furthermore, future studies should directly compare music therapy to music listening interventions and mere music listening in samples of PwD of varying disease severity and varying care settings.","['Arts in health', 'Music medicine', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Physiology', 'Psychobiological measures', 'Stress']",Physiology & behavior,2021-01-27,"[{'lastname': 'Sittler', 'firstname': 'Mareike C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Counseling and Clinical Intervention, Institute of Psychology, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Humboldtstr. 11, 07743 Jena, Germany.

30984798",Effects of mutant huntingtin inactivation on Huntington disease-related behaviours in the BACHD mouse model.,"Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with no disease-modifying treatments approved so far. Ongoing clinical trials are attempting to reduce huntingtin (HTT) expression in the central nervous system (CNS) using different strategies. Yet, the distribution and timing of HTT-lowering therapies required for a beneficial clinical effect is less clear. Here, we investigated whether HD-related behaviours could be prevented by inactivating mutant HTT at different disease stages and to varying degrees in an experimental model.
We generated mutant BACHD mice with either a widespread or circuit-specific inactivation of mutant HTT by using Cre recombinase (Cre) under the nestin promoter or the adenosine A
While motor deficits, body weight changes, anxiety and depressive-like behaviours are present in BACHD mice, early widespread CNS inactivation during development significantly improves rotarod performance, body weight changes and depressive-like behaviour. However, conditional circuit-wide mutant HTT deletion from the indirect striatal pathway during development and focal striatal-specific deletion in adulthood failed to rescue any of the HD-related behaviours.
Our results indicate that widespread targeting and the timing of interventions aimed at reducing mutant HTT are important factors to consider when developing disease-modifying therapies for HD.","['Adenosine A2A receptor', 'BACHD', 'Huntington disease', 'indirect striatal pathway', 'striatum']",Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,2020-12-18,"[{'lastname': 'Cheong', 'firstname': 'Rachel Y', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Baldo', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Sajjad', 'firstname': 'Muhammad U', 'initials': 'MU', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirik', 'firstname': 'Deniz', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Brain Repair and Imaging in Neural Systems Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Åsa', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}]",,,"While motor deficits, body weight changes, anxiety and depressive-like behaviours are present in BACHD mice, early widespread CNS inactivation during development significantly improves rotarod performance, body weight changes and depressive-like behaviour.

32790653",Psychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19 and Their Social Significance.,"Alterations in complex behavioral patterns during the extended period of the COVID-19 pandemic are predicted to promote a variety of psychiatric disease symptoms due to enforced social isolation and self-quarantine. Accordingly, multifaceted mental health problems will continue to increase, thereby creating a challenge for society and the health care system in general. Recent studies show that COVID-19 can directly or indirectly influence the central nervous system, potentially causing neurological pathologies such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Thus, chronic COVID-19-related disease processes have the potential to cause serious mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Importantly, mental health problems can foster systemic changes in functionally-linked neuroendocrine conditions that heighten a person's susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. These altered defense mechanisms may include compromised ""self-control"" and ""self-care"", as well as a ""lack of insight"" into the danger posed by the virus. These consequences may have serious social impacts on the future of COVID-19 survivors. Compounding the functionally related issues of altered mental health parameters and viral susceptibility are the potential effects of compromised immunity on the establishment of functional herd immunity. Within this context, mental health takes on added importance, particularly in terms of the need to increase support for mental health research and community-based initiatives. Thus, COVID-19 infections continue to reveal mental health targets, a process we must now be prepared to deal with.",[],Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2020-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'Ptacek', 'firstname': 'Radek', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Ptackova', 'firstname': 'Hana', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Anders', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Stefano', 'firstname': 'George B', 'initials': 'GB', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive and Molecular Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, NY, USA.'}]",,,,,10.12659/MSM.930340,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d95f3540>

19959250",Blood-based biomarkers in hypothalamic-pituitary axes for the risk of dementia or cognitive decline: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Blood-based biomarkers are ideal candidates for dementia prediction. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate longitudinal relationships of blood hormones and hormone-binding proteins in hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axes with dementia or cognitive decline. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and BIOSIS were systematically searched from 1919 to June 2020. Fifteen types of hormones and four types of hormone-binding proteins were measured in 48 prospective studies. Increased risk of dementia or cognitive decline could be predicted by elevated blood concentrations of free-thyroxine (free-T4, RR = 1.06, p = 0.001) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG, RR = 1.10, p = 0.025). Lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within (RR = 1.28, p < 0.001) and below (RR = 1.27, p = 0.004) the normal range were both risky. Current evidence suggests the alterations of multiple blood molecules in HP axes, especially TSH, free-T4, and SHBG precede the incidence of dementia or cognitive decline. The underpinning etiology remains to be elucidated in the future.","['blood biomarker', 'cognitive decline', 'dementia', 'hormone', 'hypothalamic-pituitary']",Aging,2020-10-27,"[{'lastname': 'Ge', 'firstname': 'Yi-Jun', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Chen-Chen', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Lan', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}]",,,,,"10.18632/aging.103813

Preclinical and human clinical trial data reveal exciting potential for novel treatment targets and therapeutic modulation with prebiotics, medicinal herbs, probiotics, and synbiotics in health, aging, and neurodegeneration and are reviewed here. While greater insights and characterization of the microbiota-gut-brain axis have been revealed over the past decade, salient questions related to the pathology, pathogenesis and clinical treatment of the axis in the context of both health and neurodegenerative disease remain and are discussed in this review. Future directions such as additional well-controlled, large scale, longitudinal human clinical trials are urgently needed to further elucidate both mechanism and therapeutic opportunity in health, neurological disease, and disease subpopulations to ensure that the next decade ushers the dawn of targeted therapeutic modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","['gut-brain axis', 'prebiotic', 'probiotic']",Journal of evidence-based integrative medicine,2020-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Christine Tara', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, Center of Excellence for Research and Training in Integrative Health, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1177/2515690X20957225,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d949df40>

25046530",Melatonin and Autophagy in Aging-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"With aging, the nervous system gradually undergoes degeneration. Increased oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death are considered to be common pathophysiological mechanisms of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Autophagy is a cellular basic metabolic process that degrades the aggregated or misfolded proteins and abnormal organelles in cells. The abnormal regulation of neuronal autophagy is accompanied by the accumulation and deposition of irregular proteins, leading to changes in neuron homeostasis and neurodegeneration. Autophagy exhibits both a protective mechanism and a damage pathway related to programmed cell death. Because of its ""double-edged sword"", autophagy plays an important role in neurological damage and NDDs including AD, PD, HD, OPIDN, and ALS. Melatonin is a neuroendocrine hormone mainly synthesized in the pineal gland and exhibits a wide range of biological functions, such as sleep control, regulating circadian rhythm, immune enhancement, metabolism regulation, antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-tumor effects. It can prevent cell death, reduce inflammation, block calcium channels, etc. In this review, we briefly discuss the neuroprotective role of melatonin against various NDDs via regulating autophagy, which could be a new field for future translational research and clinical studies to discover preventive or therapeutic agents for many NDDs.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Huntington’s disease', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'autophagy', 'melatonin', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy']",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-10-02,"[{'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Fang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurosurgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Sandhu', 'firstname': 'Aaron F', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurosurgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Rungratanawanich', 'firstname': 'Wiramon', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Section of Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology, Laboratory of Membrane Biochemistry and Biophysics, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20892, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'George E', 'initials': 'GE', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurosurgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Akbar', 'firstname': 'Mohammed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neuroscience & Behavior, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Shuanhu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Byoung-Joon', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Section of Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology, Laboratory of Membrane Biochemistry and Biophysics, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20892, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurosurgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms21197174

69,32969239,Stress-Induced Neurodegeneration: The Potential for Coping as Neuroprotective Therapy.,"Stress responses are essential for survival, but become detrimental to health and cognition with chronic activation. Chronic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis release of glucocorticoids induces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and neuronal loss, decreases learning and memory, and modifies glucocorticoid receptor/mineralocorticoid receptor expression. Elderly who report increased stress are nearly 3 times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, have decreased global cognition and faster cognitive decline than those reporting no stress. Patients with mild cognitive impairment are more sensitive to stress compared to healthy elderly and those with Alzheimer's disease. Stress may also transduce neurodegeneration via the gut microbiome. Coping styles determine hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor expression in mice, indicating that coping modifies cortisol's effect on the brain. Identifying neuroprotective coping strategies that lessen the burden of stress may prevent or slow cognitive decline. Treatments and education designed to reduce stress should be recognized as neuroprotective.","['Alzheimer’s disease (AD)', 'cognition', 'coping', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis', 'neurodegeneration', 'stress']",American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,2020-09-25,"[{'lastname': 'Kline', 'firstname': 'Shelby A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Health, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mega', 'firstname': 'Michael S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Health, Portland, OR, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1177/1533317520960873,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9755090>

31488882",Roles of Gut Microbiota in Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease and Therapeutic Effects of Chinese Medicine.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and its susceptibility and development process are affected by age, genetic and epigenetic factors. Recent studies confirmed that gut microbiota (GM) might contribute to AD through a variety of pathways including hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and inflflammatory and immune processes. CM formula, herbs, and monomer enjoy unique advantages to treat and prevent AD. Hence, the purpose of this review is to outline the roles of GM and its core metabolites in the pathogenesis of AD. Research progress of CMs regarding the mechanisms of how they regulate GM to improve cognitive impairment of AD is also reviewed. The authors tried to explore new therapeutic strategies to AD based on the regulation of GM using CM.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Chinese medicine', 'gut microbiota', 'pathogenesis']",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,2020-09-03,"[{'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Ying-Xin', 'initials': 'YX', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Xi-Juan', 'initials': 'XJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Qing', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Ye-Fei', 'initials': 'YF', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Dan-Bin', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Wen-Yun', 'initials': 'WY', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Lin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Hu-Hu', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.

72,32853753,Embryonic proteoglycans regulate monoamines in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.,"Using the rat Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like model we have analyzed the hippocampal short-term potentiation, levels of monoamines, and morphological changes in the hippocampal and cortical neurons after the administration of proteoglycans of embryonic origin (PEG). Results showed that the levels of monoamines and especially norepinephrine in the target AD brain structures were found elevated, except serotonin, which was unaffected in the hippocampus, but decreased in the frontal cortex. These changes were accompanied by the substantial structural damage of cortical and hippocampal neurons. PEG was able to reverse most of these changes. In addition, PEG administration had regime-dependent effects on a short-term potentiation pattern of hippocampal neurons. The elevated levels of key elements of brain monoaminergic system in the model of AD support the hypothesis of the important role of monoamines in the excessive synaptic excitation resulting in cognitive dysfunction in AD brain. The neuroprotective effect of PEG, as manifested by the recovery of the monoaminergic system, suggests this bioactive substance as a perspective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Cortex', 'Hippocampus', 'Monoamines', 'Proteoglycans of embryonic origin', 'Short-term potentiation']",Neurochemistry international,2020-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Chavushyan', 'firstname': 'Vergine', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neuroscience, Yerevan State Medical University after M.Heratsi, Yerevan, Armenia; Laboratory of Neuroendocrine Relations, L.

Accumulated evidence from transgenic animal Alzheimer's disease (AD) models and human AD patients have demonstrated that BBB dysfunction is a major player in AD pathology. In this review, we discuss the role of the BBB in maintaining brain integrity and how this is mediated by crosstalk between BBB-associated cells within the neurovascular unit (NVU). We then discuss the role of the NVU, in particular its endothelial cell, pericyte, and glial cell constituents, in AD pathogenesis. The effect of substances released by the neuroendocrine system in modulating BBB function and AD pathogenesis is also discussed. We perform a systematic review of currently available AD treatments specifically targeting pericytes and BBB glial cells. In summary, this review provides a comprehensive overview of BBB dysfunction in AD and a new perspective on the development of therapeutics for AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Blood-brain barrier', 'Endothelial cells', 'Neuroendocrine', 'Neurovascular unit']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2020-08-12,"[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Zhangsen', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Lik-Wei', 'initials': 'LW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597, Singapore; Neurobiology/Aging Program, Life Sciences Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117456, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'Yixun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Xiaomin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Nan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, PO Box 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'Chenju', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.

74,32609399,Pineal volume reduction in patients with mild cognitive impairment who converted to Alzheimer's disease.,"Pineal parenchymal volume (PPV) reduction is one of the predisposing factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, PPV could be used as a predictor of developing AD in clinical settings. We investigated whether PPV in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was correlated with conversion of these patients to AD.
A total of 237 patients with MCI underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. A two-sample t-test was used to compare PPV at baseline in MCI patients who converted to AD (MCI-C) with those who did not convert (MCI-NC). Logistic regression analysis with forced entry was used to identify predictors of AD, with variables of PPV, age, sex, education, APOE-ε4 alleles, Mini Mental State Examination score, and total intracranial volume at baseline. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to compare PPV at baseline and at the last examination in the MCI-C and MCI-NC groups.
PPV in the MCI-C group was significantly lower than that in the MCI-NC group. In logistic regression analysis, two independent predictors of AD were identified: Mini Mental State Examination and PPV. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant group effect, but no time effect.
The pineal volume is a predictor of AD conversion, and pineal volume reduction in AD starts early when patients are still in the MCI stage. Thus, pineal volume reduction might be useful as a predictor of developing AD in clinical settings.","[""Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'MRI', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'pineal gland']",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2020-07-02,"[{'lastname': 'Matsuoka', 'firstname': 'Teruyuki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Oya', 'firstname': 'Nozomu', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yokota', 'firstname': 'Hajime', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Radiology and Radiation Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Akazawa', 'firstname': 'Kentaro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamada', 'firstname': 'Kei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Narumoto', 'firstname': 'Jin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,"The pineal volume is a predictor of AD conversion, and pineal volume reduction in AD starts early when patients are still in the MCI stage.

75,32590293,Imbalance of the oxytocin-vasopressin system contributes to the neuropsychiatric phenotype in the BACHD mouse model of Huntington disease.,"Neuropsychiatric disturbances with altered social cognition, depression and anxiety are among the most debilitating early features in the fatal neurodegenerative disorder Huntington disease (HD) which is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not known. Neuropathological analyses of postmortem human HD hypothalamic tissue have demonstrated loss of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin. The dynamic interplay between these neuropeptides is crucial for modulating emotional and social behavior but its role in HD is unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of expressing the mutant huntingtin gene on the development of behavioral changes using the transgenic BACHD mouse model at different ages. We show for the first time that BACHD mice exhibit deficits in social behavior with parallel aberrations in the balance of the oxytocin-vasopressin system. Importantly, our data also show that restoration of the interplay within the system with an acute dose of intranasal oxytocin immediately prior to behavioral testing can rescue the depressive-like phenotype but not anxiety-like behavior in this transgenic model. These findings demonstrate that imbalances in the oxytocin-vasopressin interplay contribute to the neuropsychiatric component of HD and suggest that interventions aimed at restoring the blunted levels of oxytocin may confer therapeutic benefits for this disease.","['Huntington’s disease', 'Hypothalamus', 'Neuropsychiatric behavior', 'Oxytocin', 'Vasopressin']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-06-27,"[{'lastname': 'Cheong', 'firstname': 'Rachel Y', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.

77,32540812,[Mutltifaceted biological roles of leptin].,"The identification of leptin allowed the discovery of a new endocrine system. This major adipokine controlling energy homeostasis is also involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine function and fertility. Unfortunately, leptin is not able to treat common obesity, which associates hyperleptinemia and resistance to the hormone. Conversely, treatment with recombinant leptin is effective in situations of leptin deficiency. Several pathophysiological situations associated with adipose tissue dysfunctions and abnormal regulation of leptin secretion are discussed in this review. The advantage of the potential use of the leptin assay in some pathophysiological conditions is proposed.","['cancer', 'dementia', 'fertility', 'leptin', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']",Annales de biologie clinique,2020-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Charchour', 'firstname': 'Rim', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Hôpitaux universitaires Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Département de biochimie-pharmacologie-biologie moléculaire-génétique médicale, Créteil, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Dufour-Rainfray', 'firstname': 'Diane', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Service de médecine nucléaire in vitro, CHU Tours, France, Inserm, UMR 1253, iBrain, Université de Tours, Tours, France, Groupe de biologie spécialisée, Société française de médecine nucléaire, SFMN, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Morineau', 'firstname': 'Gilles', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Hôpital Lariboisière, AP-HP, Service de biochimie et biologie moléculaire, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Vatier', 'firstname': 'Camille', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Sorbonne Université, Inserm UMR_S 938, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine, Institut hospitalo-universitaire de cardio-métabolisme et nutrition (ICAN), Paris, France, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Centre national de référence des pathologies rares de l'insulino-sécrétion et de l'insulino-sensibilité (PRISIS), Service d'endocrinologie, diabétologie et endocrinologie de la reproduction, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Fellahi', 'firstname': 'Soraya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Sorbonne Université, Inserm UMR_S 938, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine, Institut hospitalo-universitaire de cardio-métabolisme et nutrition (ICAN), Paris, France, Hôpital Tenon, AP-HP, Service de biochimie et hormonologie, UF Bio-marqueurs inflammatoires et métaboliques, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Vigouroux', 'firstname': 'Corinne', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Sorbonne Université, Inserm UMR_S 938, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine, Institut hospitalo-universitaire de cardio-métabolisme et nutrition (ICAN), Paris, France, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Centre national de référence des pathologies rares de l'insulino-sécrétion et de l'insulino-sensibilité (PRISIS), Service d'endocrinologie, diabétologie et endocrinologie de la reproduction, Paris, France, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Laboratoire commun de biologie et génétique moléculaires, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Genoux', 'firstname': 'Annelise', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire de biochimie, Institut fédératif de biologie, Hôpital Purpan, CHU de Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Capeau', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Sorbonne Université, Inserm UMR_S 938, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine, Institut hospitalo-universitaire de cardio-métabolisme et nutrition (ICAN), Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lacorte', 'firstname': 'Jean-Marc', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière-Charles Foix, AP-HP, Service de biochimie endocrinienne et oncologique, Paris, France, Sorbonne Université, Inserm, UMR_S 1166, Research Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Metabolism and Nutrition, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Collet', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Service de médecine nucléaire in vitro, CHU Tours, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Cuerq', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Hospices civils de Lyon, Centre hospitalier Lyon Sud, Laboratoire de biochimie et biologie moléculaire, Lyon, France, Unité médicale de nutrition endocrinologie métabolisme, Pierre Bénite, France\xa0; Inserm U1060-CarMeN, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Bastard', 'firstname': 'Jean-Philippe', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Hôpitaux universitaires Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Département de biochimie-pharmacologie-biologie moléculaire-génétique médicale, Créteil, France, Sorbonne Université, Inserm UMR_S 938, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine, Institut hospitalo-universitaire de cardio-métabolisme et nutrition (ICAN), Paris, France, Hôpital Tenon, AP-HP, Service de biochimie et hormonologie, UF Bio-marqueurs inflammatoires et métaboliques, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1684/abc.2020.1560,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d864ef90>
78,32540556,Salivary cortisol and five-year change in cognitive performance in non-demented elderly subjects: a population-based study.,"Elevated cortisol levels have been associated with poorer cognitive performance in cross-sectional studies; this may be both a factor contributing to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and a result of developing brain pathologies. However, it is still unclear (1) whether cortisol measures predict later cognitive decline and (2) whether cortisol changes over the years might be associated with cognitive changes. We analyzed data from CoLaus/PsyCoLaus, a prospective population-based study. Salivary cortisol (4 different measures on 1 day) and neuropsychological assessments were performed at a first visit and a follow-up visit 5 years later in 625 dementia-free participants aged ≥65 years. Salivary cortisol levels at waking and 30 minutes after waking, as well as longitudinal changes in cortisol 30 minutes after waking, cortisol awakening response, and cortisol AM-PM difference were associated with decline in global cognition. After controlling for potential confounders, only longitudinal changes in cortisol 30 minutes after waking remained associated with cognitive decline. These mostly negative findings indicate absent or subtle association between salivary cortisol and cognitive decline.","['Cognition', 'Cognitive decline', 'Cortisol', 'Dementia', 'HPA axis', 'Memory']",Neurobiology of aging,2020-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Ouanes', 'firstname': 'Sami', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Service of Old Age Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Department of Psychiatry, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.

79,32335558,Amyloid Beta Peptide Is an Endogenous Negative Allosteric Modulator of Leptin Receptor.,"Metabolic dysfunction is now recognized as a pivotal component of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementia worldwide. However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking metabolic dysfunction to AD remain elusive.
Here, we investigated the direct impact of soluble oligomeric amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, the main molecular hallmark of AD, on the leptin system, a major component of central energy metabolism regulation.
We developed a new time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based Aβ binding assay for the leptin receptor (LepR) and studied the effect of Aβ on LepR function in several in vitro assays. The in vivo effect of Aβ on LepR function was studied in an Aβ-specific AD mouse model and in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus.
We revealed specific and high-affinity (Ki = 0.1 nM) binding of Aβ to LepR. Pharmacological characterization of this interaction showed that Aβ binds allosterically to the extracellular domain of LepR and negatively affects receptor function. Negative allosteric modulation of LepR by Aβ was detected at the level of signaling pathways (STAT-3, AKT, and ERK) in vitroand in vivo. Importantly, the leptin-induced response of POMC neurons, key players in the regulation of metabolic function, was completely abolished in the presence of Aβ.
Our data indicate that Aβ is a negative allosteric modulator of LepR, resulting in impaired leptin action, and qualify LepR as a new and direct target of Aβ oligomers. Preventing the interaction of Aβ with LepR might improve both the metabolic and cognitive dysfunctions in AD condition.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Amyloid beta', 'Leptin receptor', 'Metabolism']",Neuroendocrinology,2020-04-27,"[{'lastname': 'Cecon', 'firstname': 'Erika', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Institut Cochin, Université de Paris, CNRS, INSERM, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lhomme', 'firstname': 'Tori', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Univ.

80,32278163,Ozone increases plasma kynurenine-tryptophan ratio and impacts hippocampal serotonin receptor and neurotrophic factor expression: Role of stress hormones.,"Air pollution is associated with adverse impacts on the brain, including cognitive decline and increased incidence of dementia, depression and anxiety; however, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We have shown that both ozone and particulate matter activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increasing plasma glucocorticoids and altering mRNA profiles in multiple tissues including the brain. HPA axis dysregulation has been associated with central nervous system impacts, including key effects in the hippocampus; accordingly, we hypothesized that pollutant-dependent increases in glucocorticoid levels impact biological pathways relevant to brain health. Fischer-344 rats were treated with metyrapone (0 or 50 mg/kg), a glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, and exposed to ozone (0 or 0.8 ppm) for 4 h (n = 5/group) to investigate the role of glucocorticoids in ozone-dependent effects on tryptophan metabolism and expression of serotonin receptors and neurotrophic factors. Ozone increased plasma levels of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine (~2-fold) and decreased tryptophan levels (~1.2 fold). Hippocampal expression of serotonin receptors exhibited differential regulation following exposure, and expression of key neurotrophic factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, insulin-like growth factor-1, tyrosine kinase receptor B, b-cell lymphoma 2) was decreased. Some, but not all effects were abrogated by metyrapone treatment, suggesting both glucocorticoid-dependent and -independent regulation. Exposure to exogenous corticosterone (10 mg/kg) followed by clean air reproduced the ozone effects that were blocked with metyrapone, confirming the specificity of effects to glucocorticoids. These results indicate that ozone can modify pathways relevant to brain health and establish a role for the HPA axis in mediating these effects.","['Air pollution', 'Brain', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Rat']",Environmental research,2020-04-12,"[{'lastname': 'Rose', 'firstname': 'Mercedes', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0K9, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, K1H 8M5, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Filiatreault', 'firstname': 'Alain', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0K9, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Guénette', 'firstname': 'Josée', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0K9, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0K9, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomson', 'firstname': 'Errol M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0K9, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, K1H 8M5, Canada.

81,32089232,"LW-AFC, a new formula from the traditional Chinese medicine Liuwei Dihuang decoction, as a promising therapy for Alzheimer's disease: Pharmacological effects and mechanisms.","LW-AFC is a new formula derived from the Liuwei Dihuang decoction, a classical traditional Chinese medicine prescription. Based on our research, LW-AFC is a promising drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The studies were conducted primarily in two typical AD mouse models: SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that LW-AFC could improve many cognitive behaviors, such as spatial learning and memory ability, passive and active avoidance response, and object recognition memory capability. In addition, LW-AFC could also alleviate the AD-like pathology in animal models, such as neuron loss and Aβ deposition. Subsequent studies found that LW-AFC could rebalance hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and modulate the disturbance of immune system and gut flora. These data suggested that the anti-AD effects of LW-AFC might be mainly via modulating the neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) network. As inhibiting the immune function by immunosuppressant could abolish the protective effects of LW-AFC against long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment model, it is likely that LW-AFC balancing the NIM network is initiated by modulating the immune system.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis', 'Liuwei Dihuang decoction', 'Neuroendocrine immunomodulation network']","Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)",2020-02-25,"[{'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Xiaorui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yongxiang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Wenxia', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.

83,31918850,Neuroendocrine Disturbances in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Scoping Review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases cause progressive irreversible neuronal loss that has broad downstream effects. The neuroendocrine system regulates homeostasis of circuits that control critical functions such as the stress response, metabolism, reproduction, fluid balance, and glucose control. These systems are frequently disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders yet often overlooked in clinical practice.
This review aims to gather the available data regarding these disturbances in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease and also to demonstrate the volume of literature in these individual arenas.
Using the scoping review framework, a literature search was performed in PubMed to identify relevant articles published within the past 30 years (January 1988 to November 2018). The search criteria produced a total of 2022 articles, 328 of which were identified as relevant to this review.
Several major themes emerged from this review. These neuroendocrine disturbances may be a precursor to the illness, a part of the primary pathophysiology, or a direct consequence of the disease or independent of it. They have the potential to further understanding of the disease, exacerbate the underlying pathology, or provide therapeutic benefit.
By synthesizing the data from a systems' perspective, we aim to broaden how clinicians think about these illnesses and provide care.","[""Alzheimer's"", ""Huntington's disease"", 'dementia', 'internal medicine', 'neuropsychiatry']",Psychosomatics,2020-01-11,"[{'lastname': 'Newhouse', 'firstname': 'Amy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Psychiatry and Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.

84,31914623,Glucocorticoid receptors signaling impairment potentiates amyloid-β oligomers-induced pathology in an acute model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with elevated circulating glucocorticoids (GC) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) signaling impairment. However, the precise role of GR in the pathophysiology of AD remains unclear. Using an acute model of AD induced by the intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-β oligomers (oAβ), we analyzed cellular and behavioral hallmarks of AD, GR signaling pathways, processing of amyloid precursor protein, and enzymes involved in Tau phosphorylation. We focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly rich in GR, early altered in AD and involved in HPA axis control and cognitive functions. We found that oAβ impaired cognitive and emotional behaviors, increased plasma GC levels, synaptic deficits, apoptosis and neuroinflammatory processes. Moreover, oAβ potentiated the amyloidogenic pathway and enzymes involved both in Tau hyperphosphorylation and GR activation. Treatment with a selective GR modulator (sGRm) normalized plasma GC levels and all behavioral and biochemical parameters analyzed. GR seems to occupy a central position in the pathophysiology of AD. Deregulation of the HPA axis and a feed-forward effect on PFC GR sensitivity could participate in the etiology of AD, in perturbing Aβ and Tau homeostasis. These results also reinforce the therapeutic potential of sGRm in AD.","['Cdk5', 'GSK‐3β', 'PDK1', 'ROCK', 'selective GR modulator']",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2020-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Canet', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Pineau', 'firstname': 'Fanny', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Zussy', 'firstname': 'Charleine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Hernandez', 'firstname': 'Célia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Hunt', 'firstname': 'Hazel', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Corcept Therapeutics, Menlo Park, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chevallier', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Perrier', 'firstname': 'Véronique', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Torrent', 'firstname': 'Joan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Belanoff', 'firstname': 'Joseph K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Corcept Therapeutics, Menlo Park, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Meijer', 'firstname': 'Onno C', 'initials': 'OC', 'affiliation': 'Einthoven Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Desrumaux', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Givalois', 'firstname': 'Laurent', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia (MMDN) Laboratory, INSERM U1198, Team Environmental Impact in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (EiAlz), Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.""}]",,,,© 2019 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.,10.1096/fj.201900723RRR,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8790ae0>

86,31715317,Deterioration of neuroregenerative plasticity in association with testicular atrophy and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in Huntington's disease: A putative role of the huntingtin gene in steroidogenesis.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive neurodegenerative disorder mainly affecting the structure and functions of the striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus leading to movement disorders, cognitive dysfunctions and emotional disturbances. The onset of HD has been linked to a pathogenic CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes for the polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. Notably, the neuropathogenic events of the mutant HTT gene appear to be primed during adulthood and magnified along the ageing process. While the normal Htt protein is vital for the neuronal differentiation and neuroprotection, experimental HD models and postmortem human HD brains have been characterized by neurodegeneration and defects in neuroregenerative plasticity in the basal ganglia and limbic system including the hippocampus. Besides gonadal dysfunctions, reduced androgen levels and abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis have increasingly been evident in HD. Recently, ageing-related changes in levels of steroid sex hormones have been proposed to play a detrimental effect on the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain. Considering its adult-onset nature, a potential relationship between dysregulation in the synthesis of sex steroid hormones and the pathogenesis of the mutant HTT gene appears to be an important clinical issue in HD. While the hippocampus and testis are the major sites of steroidogenesis, the presence of Htt in both areas is conclusively evident. Hence, the expression of the normal HTT gene may take part in the steroidogenic events in aforementioned organs in the physiological state, whereas the mutant HTT gene may cause defects in steroidogenesis in HD. Therefore, this review article comprehends the potential relationship between the gonadal dysfunctions and abnormal hippocampal plasticity in HD and represents a hypothesis for the putative role of the HTT gene in the regulation of steroidogenesis in gonads and in the brain.","['Gonadal dysfunctions', 'HPG axis', 'Hippocampal neurogenesis', 'Huntington’s disease', 'Reactive neuroblastosis', 'Steroidogenesis']",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Selvaraj', 'firstname': 'Kaviya', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Manickam', 'firstname': 'Nivethitha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neuroregeneration, Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumaran', 'firstname': 'Elamathi', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Thangadurai', 'firstname': 'Kayalvizhi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bio-Medical Science, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, 620024, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Elumalai', 'firstname': 'Gokul', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neuroregeneration, Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sekar', 'firstname': 'Aravinthan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Radhakrishnan', 'firstname': 'Risna Kanjirassery', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neuroregeneration, Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kandasamy', 'firstname': 'Mahesh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India; Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neuroregeneration, Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India; Faculty Recharge Programme, University Grants Commission (UGC-FRP), New Delhi, India.

87,31625472,Navigating Alzheimer's Disease via Chronic Stress: The Role of Glucocorticoids.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic intensifying incurable progressive disease leading to neurological deterioration manifested as impairment of memory and executive brain functioning affecting the physical ability like intellectual brilliance, common sense in patients. The recent therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease is only the symptomatic relief further emerging the need for therapeutic strategies to be targeted in managing the underlying silent killing progression of dreaded pathology. Therefore, the current research direction is focused on identifying the molecular mechanisms leading to the evolution of the understanding of the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. The resultant saturation in the area of current targets (amyloid β, τ Protein, oxidative stress etc.) has led the scientific community to rethink of the mechanistic neurodegenerative pathways and reprogram the current research directions. Although, the role of stress has been recognized for many years and contributing to the development of cognitive impairment, the area of stress has got the much-needed impetus recently and is being recognized as a modifiable menace for AD. Stress is an unavoidable human experience that can be resolved and normalized but chronic activation of stress pathways unsettle the physiological status. Chronic stress mediated activation of neuroendocrine stimulation is generally linked to a high risk of developing AD. Chronic stress-driven physiological dysregulation and hypercortisolemia intermingle at the neuronal level and leads to functional (hypometabolism, excitotoxicity, inflammation) and anatomical remodeling of the brain architecture (senile plaques, τ tangles, hippocampal atrophy, retraction of spines) ending with severe cognitive deterioration. The present review is an effort to collect the most pertinent evidence that support chronic stress as a realistic and modifiable therapeutic earmark for AD and to advocate glucocorticoid receptors as therapeutic interventions.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'HPA axis', 'Stress', 'amyloid β', 'glucocorticoids', 'inflammation', 'neurodegeneration.']",Current drug targets,2019-10-19,"[{'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Vivek Kumar', 'initials': 'VK', 'affiliation': 'Government College of Pharmacy, Rohru, District Shimla, Himachal Pradesh-171207, India.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Rajpura, Punjab-140401, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Thakur Gurjeet', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Rajpura, Punjab-140401, India.'}]",,,,"Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",10.2174/1389450120666191017114735,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d87553b0>

21324360",The Role of Hypothalamic Pathology for Non-Motor Features of Huntington's Disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal genetic neurodegenerative disorder. It has mainly been considered a movement disorder with cognitive symptoms and these features have been associated with pathology of the striatum and cerebral cortex. Importantly, individuals with the mutant huntingtin gene suffer from a spectrum of non-motor features often decades before the motor disorder manifests. These symptoms and signs include a range of psychiatric symptoms, sleep problems and metabolic changes with weight loss particularly in later stages. A higher body mass index at diagnosis is associated with slower disease progression. The common psychiatric symptom of apathy progresses with the disease. The fact that non-motor features are present early in the disease and that they show an association to disease progression suggest that unravelling the underlying neurobiological mechanisms may uncover novel targets for early disease intervention and better symptomatic treatment. The hypothalamus and the limbic system are important brain regions that regulate emotion, social cognition, sleep and metabolism. A number of studies using neuroimaging, postmortem human tissue and genetic manipulation in animal models of the disease has collectively shown that the hypothalamus and the limbic system are affected in HD. These findings include the loss of neuropeptide-expressing neurons such as orexin (hypocretin), oxytocin, vasopressin, somatostatin and VIP, and increased levels of SIRT1 in distinct nuclei of the hypothalamus. This review provides a summary of the results obtained so far and highlights the potential importance of these changes for the understanding of non-motor features in HD.","['Huntington’s disease', 'hypocretin', 'hypothalamus', 'orexin', 'oxytocin', 'vasopressin']",Journal of Huntington's disease,2019-10-09,"[{'lastname': 'Cheong', 'firstname': 'Rachel Y', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Gabery', 'firstname': 'Sanaz', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Åsa', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}]",,,,,"10.3233/JHD-190372

89,31520820,Stress hormones as potential mediators of air pollutant effects on the brain: Rapid induction of glucocorticoid-responsive genes.,"Air pollution is associated with adverse effects on brain health including cognitive decline, dementia, anxiety, depression, and suicide. While toxicological studies have demonstrated the potential for repeated or chronic pollutant exposure to lead to disease states, characterisation of initial biological responses to exposure is needed to better understand underlying mechanisms. The brain is highly sensitive to glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol in humans, corticosterone in rodents), stress hormones that play important roles in cognition and mental health. We tested whether glucocorticoids could be implicated in central nervous system (CNS) effects of pollutant exposure by examining glucocorticoid-dependent signaling across brain regions after exposure to the common pollutant ozone. Male Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 4 h to air or 0.8 ppm ozone ± metyrapone (50 mg/kg), a drug that blocks corticosterone synthesis (n = 5/group). Key glucocorticoid-responsive genes (serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, SGK; glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper, GILZ), and a gene responsive to both glucocorticoids and oxidative stress (metallothionein (MT)-1), were increased by ozone in all brain regions (olfactory bulb, frontal lobe, cortex, midbrain, hippocampus, cerebellum, brainstem), correlating with plasma corticosterone levels. Metyrapone prevented the increase in SGK and GILZ, and reduced but did not eliminate the effect on MT-1, suggesting glucocorticoid-dependent and -independent regulation. Administering exogenous corticosterone (10 mg/kg) to air-exposed rats reproduced the ozone effects, confirming specificity. The results demonstrate that early pollutant effects include stress hormone-dependent signaling. As both ozone and particulate matter activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and elevated glucocorticoids are implicated in brain pathologies, stress hormones could contribute to CNS impacts of air pollutants.","['Air pollution', 'Brain', 'Glucocorticoid', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis', 'Ozone', 'Stress hormone']",Environmental research,2019-09-15,"[{'lastname': 'Thomson', 'firstname': 'Errol M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0K9, Canada.

90,31518952,Plasma cortisol is associated with cerebral hypometabolism across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation is proposed as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study assessed cross-sectional relationships between cortisol and neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure and glucose metabolism across the AD spectrum. Participants with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and AD were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative databank, based on baseline measures of plasma cortisol, gray matter volume (n = 556), and cerebral glucose metabolism (n = 288). Relationships between plasma cortisol and the neuroimaging biomarkers were assessed. Across the entire cohort, higher plasma cortisol levels were associated with lower glucose metabolism in lateral and medial parietal regions. Higher plasma cortisol was also related to lower gray matter volume in temporal-parietal-occipital regions and in the hippocampus. There were no significant group differences in these relationships with adjustment for covariates. Our results demonstrate that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation is related to glucose hypometabolism within posterior cortical regions vulnerable to AD pathology.

91,31425747,"Alzheimer's disease-like pathology-triggered oxidative stress, alterations in monoamines levels, and structural damage of locus coeruleus neurons are partially recovered by a mix of proteoglycans of embryonic genesis.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis includes oxidative damage and perturbations of monoamines. However, as many details of these alterations are not known, we have investigated the changes in monoamine levels as well as the free radical oxidation processes (FRO) in the brainstem of rats that were administered i.c.v. Aβ (25-35) (rat model of AD-like pathology). The level of oxidative stress was found elevated in the brainstem along with the increased concentrations of monoamines, especially norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus (LC) area of the brainstem. This was accompanied by the substantial structural damage of monoaminergic neurons of LC. In addition, we have tested the ability of proteoglycans of embryonic genesis (PEG) that were shown previously to act as neuroprotectors, to restore the AD-triggered alterations in monoaminergic system and FRO. Indeed, PEG reduced the increased FRO and upregulated monoamines in the brainstem of Aβ (25-35) treated animals. Administration of PEG to control animals led to the increase of the antioxidant capacity as well as the intensity of free radical oxidation processes. Our study confirms the important role of the brainstem FRO and monoamine shifts in AD development along with the known aggregation of Ab peptide and Tau hyperphosphorylation. We suggest that at the early stages of AD development, with still functional neurons, regulation of monoamine levels via stabilizing FRO processes can be beneficial. Our data demonstrate the regulatory action of PEG on the monoamine disturbances and the level of oxidative stress in the AD damaged structures, suggesting its possible therapeutic application in AD.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Embryonic proteoglycans', 'Monoamines', 'Neuroprotection', 'Oxidative stress']",Neurochemistry international,2019-08-20,"[{'lastname': 'Aghajanov', 'firstname': 'Michail', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Yerevan State Medical University after M.

28502584","Pineal gland dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: relationship with the immune-pineal axis, sleep disturbance, and neurogenesis.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally common neurodegenerative disease, which is accompanied by alterations to various lifestyle patterns, such as sleep disturbance. The pineal gland is the primary endocrine organ that secretes hormones, such as melatonin, and controls the circadian rhythms. The decrease in pineal gland volume and pineal calcification leads to the reduction of melatonin production. Melatonin has been reported to have multiple roles in the central nervous system (CNS), including improving neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, suppressing neuroinflammation, enhancing memory function, and protecting against oxidative stress. Recently, reduced pineal gland volume and pineal calcification, accompanied by cognitive decline and sleep disturbances have been observed in AD patients. Here, I review current significant evidence of the contribution of pineal dysfunction in AD to the progress of AD neuropathology. I suggest new insights to understanding the relationship between AD pathogenesis and pineal gland function.","['Alzheimer’s disease (AD)', 'Circadian rhythms', 'Immune-pineal axis', 'Melatonin', 'Pineal calcification', 'Pineal gland']",Molecular neurodegeneration,2019-07-13,"[{'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Juhyun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, 58128, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea. juhyunsong@chonnam.ac.kr.'}]",,,,,"10.1186/s13024-019-0330-8

93,31271924,The relationship between loneliness and cognition in healthy older men and women: The role of cortisol.,"Loneliness has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people, as well as a dysregulation of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis functioning. In addition, it has been suggested that women are more vulnerable to the negative effects of loneliness on health. Our aim was to analyze the effect of HPA-axis functioning as a mediator in the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function, and interactions depending on sex, in healthy older people. To do so, 86 healthy older people (52.3% female) from 60 to 80 years old (M = 67.44, SD = 4.37) completed the revised UCLA loneliness scale. A neuropsychological battery was administered to assess global cognition, processing speed, attention and executive function, working memory, and verbal memory immediate and delayed recall. Saliva samples were provided on two consecutive weekdays to obtain awakening and bedtime cortisol levels, the diurnal cortisol slope (DCS), and the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg). Our results showed that loneliness was not directly associated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, loneliness was related to higher bedtime cortisol levels, but not to awakening cortisol, the DCS, or the AUCg. In addition, loneliness was associated with worse performance on attention and processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory immediate recall, via bedtime cortisol levels. Therefore, we suggest that HPA-axis functioning is one of the biological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between loneliness and poorer cognitive function. No sex differences were observed in these associations.","['Cognition', 'Cortisol', 'Loneliness', 'Older People']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019-07-05,"[{'lastname': 'Montoliu', 'firstname': 'Teresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Social Cognitive Neuroscience, Psychobiology-IDOCAL, Faculty of Psychology, University of Valencia, Blasco Ibáñez, 21, 46010, Valencia, Spain.

9832120",Possible Existence of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Hippocampal (HPH) Axis: A Reciprocal Relationship Between Hippocampal Specific Neuroestradiol Synthesis and Neuroblastosis in Ageing Brains with Special Reference to Menopause and Neurocognitive Disorders.,"The hippocampus-derived neuroestradiol plays a major role in neuroplasticity, independent of circulating estradiol that originates from gonads. The response of hypothalamus-pituitary regions towards the synthesis of neuroestradiol in the hippocampus is an emerging scientific concept in cognitive neuroscience. Hippocampal plasticity has been proposed to be regulated via neuroblasts, a major cellular determinant of functional neurogenesis in the adult brain. Defects in differentiation, integration and survival of neuroblasts in the hippocampus appear to be an underlying cause of neurocognitive disorders. Gonadotropin receptors and steroidogenic enzymes have been found to be expressed in neuroblasts in the hippocampus of the brain. However, the reciprocal relationship between hippocampal-specific neuroestradiol synthesis along neuroblastosis and response of pituitary based feedback regulation towards regulation of estradiol level in the hippocampus have not completely been ascertained. Therefore, this conceptual article revisits (1) the cellular basis of neuroestradiol synthesis (2) a potential relationship between neuroestradiol synthesis and neuroblastosis in the hippocampus (3) the possible involvement of aberrant neuroestradiol production with mitochondrial dysfunctions and dyslipidemia in menopause and adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders and (4) provides a hypothesis for the possible existence of the hypothalamic-pituitary-hippocampal (HPH) axis in the adult brain. Eventually, understanding the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis by abnormal levels of neuroestradiol concentration in association with the feedback regulation of HPH axis might provide additional cues to establish a neuroregenerative therapeutic management for mood swings, depression and cognitive decline in menopause and neurocognitive disorders.","['Dementia', 'Estradiol', 'Hippocampus', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-hippocampal axis', 'Menopause', 'Neuroblastosis', 'Neurocognitive disorders', 'Neurogenesis']",Neurochemical research,2019-06-30,"[{'lastname': 'Kandasamy', 'firstname': 'Mahesh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neuroregeneration, Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India. pkmahesh5@gmail.com.\nDepartment of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India. pkmahesh5@gmail.com.\nSchool of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India. pkmahesh5@gmail.com.\nFaculty Recharge Programme, University Grants Commission(UGC-FRP), New Delhi, India. pkmahesh5@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Radhakrishnan', 'firstname': 'Risna Kanjirassery', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neuroregeneration, Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.\nDepartment of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Poornimai Abirami', 'firstname': 'G P', 'initials': 'GP', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Roshan', 'firstname': 'Syed Aasish', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Gerontology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, 620024, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Yesudhas', 'firstname': 'Ajisha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neuroregeneration, Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.\nDepartment of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Balamuthu', 'firstname': 'Kadalmani', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.\nSchool of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Prahalathan', 'firstname': 'Chidambaram', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, 620024, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Shanmugaapriya', 'firstname': 'Sellathamby', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bio-Medical Science, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Moorthy', 'firstname': 'Anbalagan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Integrative Biology, School of Bioscience and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, 632014, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Essa', 'firstname': 'Musthafa Mohamed', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Agricultural and Marine Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.\nAgeing and Dementia Research Group, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.'}, {'lastname': 'Anusuyadevi', 'firstname': 'Muthuswamy', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.\nMolecular Gerontology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, 620024, India.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s11064-019-02833-1,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8a674a0>
95,31200298,Pathways linking obesity to neuropsychiatric disorders.,"Obesity has been associated with cognitive and behavioral syndromes. Individuals who are obese have higher risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and dementia than non-obese. Conversely, patients with neuropsychiatric conditions may exhibit some features that contribute to obesity development such as unhealthy behaviors and treatment with drugs that increase appetite. This review addresses the multiple pathways implicated in the relationship between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly mood disorders, schizophrenia, and major neurocognitive disorder or dementia. Both obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by a low-grade systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. Obesity is frequently accompanied by neuroendocrine changes, particularly involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Indeed, activation of the stress system is commonly seen as a trigger for mood episodes, psychosis exacerbation, and cognitive decline. Growing evidence suggests the role of gut microbiota in obesity and brain functioning through the modulation of the inflammatory response and HPA axis. Owing to the intricate relationship between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders, tackling one of them may affect the other. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathways underlying the link between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders can contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for these conditions.","['Dementia', 'Depression', 'Low-grade inflammation', 'Obesity', 'Schizophrenia']","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2019-06-15,"[{'lastname': 'Martins', 'firstname': 'Laís Bhering', 'initials': 'LB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition, Nursing School, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Monteze', 'firstname': 'Nayara Mussi', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition, Nursing School, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Calarge', 'firstname': 'Chadi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferreira', 'firstname': 'Adaliene Versiani Matos', 'initials': 'AVM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition, Nursing School, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Teixeira', 'firstname': 'Antônio Lúcio', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychiatry Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA; Santa Casa BH Ensino e Pesquisa, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

96,31199948,Anxiolytic impact of Apelin-13 in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease: Involvement of glucocorticoid receptor and FKBP5.,"Apelin-13 is known to be one of the predominant neuropeptides with marked protective role in circuits involved in mood disturbances. The most putative hypothesis in pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is Amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation which interrupt proper function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and are associated with anxiety. Here, we assessed the potential anxiolytic effect of Apelin-13 in a rodent cognitive impairment model induced by intrahippocampal Aβ 25-35 administration. We evaluated the memory impairment and anxiogenic behavior using shuttle box and Elevated plus maze apparatuses. We also measured the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) expression as important markers showing the proper feedback mechanism within the HPA axis. Our findings showed that Aβ 25-35 administration induced memory impairment and anxiety behaviors. Apelin-13 exerted the anxiolytic effects and provided protection against Aβ 25-35 -induced passive avoidance memory impairment. Moreover, Apelin-13 caused an increase in GR and a decrease in FKBP5 expression levels in Aβ 25-35 treated animals. Taken together, these findings showed the anxiolytic effect of Apelin-13. This effect at least in part, may be mediated through the regulation of GR and FKBP5 expression levels which have a pivotal role in the appropriate negative feedback mechanism within the HPA axis. These data suggest that Apelin-13 might be considered as a potential neuropeptide defense that reduces anxiety along with neuroprotective effect against the Aβ 25-35 -induced injury.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Anxiety', 'Apelin', 'FKBP5', 'Glucocorticoid receptor']",Peptides,2019-06-15,"[{'lastname': 'Aminyavari', 'firstname': 'Samaneh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Addiction Studies, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Zahmatkesh', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Addiction Studies, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Electrophysiology Research Center, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran, Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Cognitive Sciences and Behavioral Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

12691614","Air Pollution, Stress, and Allostatic Load: Linking Systemic and Central Nervous System Impacts.","Air pollution is a risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality. A growing literature also links exposure to diverse air pollutants (e.g., nanoparticles, particulate matter, ozone, traffic-related air pollution) with brain health, including increased incidence of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as cognitive decline, dementia (including Alzheimer's disease), anxiety, depression, and suicide. A critical gap in our understanding of adverse impacts of pollutants on the central nervous system (CNS) is the early initiating events triggered by pollutant inhalation that contribute to disease progression. Recent experimental evidence has shown that particulate matter and ozone, two common pollutants with differing characteristics and reactivity, can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and release glucocorticoid stress hormones (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in rodents) as part of a neuroendocrine stress response. The brain is highly sensitive to stress: stress hormones affect cognition and mental health, and chronic stress can produce profound biochemical and structural changes in the brain. Chronic activation and/or dysfunction of the HPA axis also increases the burden on physiological stress response systems, conceptualized as allostatic load, and is a common pathway implicated in many diseases. The present paper provides an overview of how systemic stress-dependent biological responses common to particulate matter and ozone may provide insight into early CNS effects of pollutants, including links with oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic processes. Evidence of pollutant effect modification by non-chemical stressors (e.g., socioeconomic position, psychosocial, noise), age (prenatal to elderly), and sex will also be reviewed in the context of susceptibility across the lifespan.","['Air pollution', 'brain', 'cognition', 'dementia', 'depression', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis', 'mental health', 'ozone', 'particulate matter']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Thomson', 'firstname': 'Errol M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-190015,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8edc9f0>
98,31054882,Early neurochemical modifications of monoaminergic systems in the R6/1 mouse model of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, autosomal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and cognitive impairments appearing in adults. The R6/1 mouse model of the disease recapitulates the adult onset of motor symptoms preceded by cognitive and affective deficits. The monoaminergic systems participate in the establishment of motor and cognitive loops and we postulated that their organization and interaction could be precociously altered. Using tissue measurement of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline, and some metabolites, we observed that DA and/or its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), but not 5-HT or noradrenaline tissue content was reduced in an age-dependent manner (from two to six months) in the striatum, substantia nigra and globus pallidus of R6/1 mice. The metabolite of 5-HT was also lower in R6/1 mice, mainly in the substantia nigra and hippocampus. We then addressed early disorganization of monoaminergic systems in 18 brain regions encompassing several neurobiological networks in 35 day-old animals. DA tissue content was not altered in the striatum or substantia nigra but was decreased in the nucleus accumbens and increased in the globus pallidus. The correlations of monoaminergic index in-between the 18 selected brain regions revealed distinct organizations of monoamines in R6/1 mice, notably marked by a loss of the number of correlations of the DOPAC/DA ratio. The neurochemical analyses show that each monoaminergic system is distinctly altered in the R6/1 mouse model. The early abnormal organization of these systems likely points out altered maturation of neurobiological networks at early stages of HD.","['5-HIAA', 'Connectivity', 'Correlative analysis', 'Cortex', 'DOPAC', 'Dopamine', 'HPLC', 'Mesencephalon', 'Neurochemistry', 'Noradrenaline', 'Serotonin', 'Striatum']",Neurochemistry international,2019-05-06,"[{'lastname': 'Puginier', 'firstname': 'Emilie', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique-Unité Mixte de Recherche 5287, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Bharatiya', 'firstname': 'Rahul', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique-Unité Mixte de Recherche 5287, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Section of Neuroscience and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Cagliari, SS 554, Km 4,500, 09042, Monserrato, Cagliari, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Chagraoui', 'firstname': 'Abdeslam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, INSERM, U1239, CHU Rouen, Neuronal and Neuroendocrine Differentiation and Communication Laboratory, Institute for Research and Innovation in Biomedicine of Normandy (IRIB), Department of Medical Biochemistry, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Manem', 'firstname': 'Julien', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique-Unité Mixte de Recherche 5287, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Yoon H', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique-Unité Mixte de Recherche 5287, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Garret', 'firstname': 'Maurice', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique-Unité Mixte de Recherche 5287, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.'}, {'lastname': 'De Deurwaerdère', 'firstname': 'Philippe', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique-Unité Mixte de Recherche 5287, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.

Findings imply that chronic noise exposure dysregulates the neuroendocrine system leading to hyperactivation of the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system (i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis), and increases stress hormones that affect brain and behaviour. Enduring dysregulation of the HPA-axis was the most discussed mechanism for the harmful effect of noise during the lifespan. Studies also suggest a causative association of noise with diverse indicators of the AD-like neuropathology in rodents and a hypersusceptibility in females. The results indicate the importance of future neuroimaging studies to quantify the potential contribution of noise in predisposing cognitive decline and preclinical signs of dementia in humans.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Dementia', 'Gestational stress', 'HPA-axis', 'HPG-axis', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise exposure', 'Noise stress', 'Prenatal stress', 'Sex', 'Sex hormones', 'Stress hormones']",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019-04-13,"[{'lastname': 'Jafari', 'firstname': 'Zahra', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB, T1K 3M4, Canada; Department of Basic Sciences in Rehabilitation, School of Rehabilitation Sciences, Iran University of Medical Science (IUMS), Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Kolb', 'firstname': 'Bryan E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB, T1K 3M4, Canada.

101,30605907,"Role of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis, Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis and Insulin Signaling in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the commonest progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain, is clinically characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Recent studies suggest a relationship between the endocrinal dysregulation and the neuronal loss during the AD pathology. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis regulating circulating levels of glucocorticoid hormones has been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Likewise, dysregulated insulin signaling, impaired glucose uptake and insulin resistance are some of the prime factors in the onset/progression of AD. In this review, we have discussed the changes in HPA and HPG axes, implicated insulin resistance/signaling and glucose regulation during the onset/progression of AD. Therefore, simultaneous detection of these endocrinal markers in the early or presymptomatic stages may help in the early diagnosis of AD. This evidence for implicated endocrinal functions supports the fact that modulation of endocrinal pathways can be used as therapeutic targets for AD. Future studies need to determine how the induction or inhibition of endocrinal targets could be used for predictable neuroprotection in AD therapies.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Glucose regulation', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis', 'Insulin resistance']",Neuropsychobiology,2019-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Ahmad', 'firstname': 'Mir Hilal', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Fatima', 'firstname': 'Mahino', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mondal', 'firstname': 'Amal Chandra', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India, acmondal@mail.jnu.ac.in.'}]",,,,"© 2019 S.

102,30597139,Sex differences in sleep and sleep loss-induced cognitive deficits: The influence of gonadal hormones.,"Males and females can respond differentially to the same environmental stimuli and experimental conditions. Chronic sleep loss is a frequent and growing problem in many modern societies and has a broad variety of negative outcomes for health and well-being. While much has been done to explore the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on cognition in both human and animal studies over the last few decades, very little attention has been paid to the part played by sex differences and gonadal steroids in respect of changes in cognitive functions caused by sleep loss. The effects of gonadal hormones on sleep regulation and cognitive performances are well established. Reduced gonadal function in menopausal women and elderly men is associated with sleep disturbances and cognitive decline as well as dementia, which suggests that sex steroids play a key role in modulating these conditions. Finding out whether there are sex differences in respect of the effect of insufficient sleep on cognition, and how neuroendocrine mediators influence cognitive impairment induced by SD could provide valuable insights into the best therapies for each sex. In this review, we aim to highlight the involvement of sex differences and gonadal hormone status on the severity of cognitive deficits induced by sleep deficiency in both human and animal studies.","['Cognitive function', 'Gonadal steroids', 'Sex differences', 'Sleep and memory', 'Sleep deprivation']",Hormones and behavior,2019-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hajali', 'firstname': 'Vahid', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

Here, we review the evidence linking thermoregulation and ALS.

Furthermore, animal models of ALS display disturbed thermoregulation as a consequence of disrupted energy homeostasis.

104,30382760,Mental health in familial caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients: are the effects of chronic stress on cognition inevitable?,"Familial caregivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients experience an emotional and physical burden which characterizes a chronic stress condition. The resulting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction favors an imbalance of neurotoxic/neuroprotective factors and causes cognitive impairments, increasing the caregivers' risk for cognitive decline and compromising their ability to provide adequate care of the patient. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the reversibility of the cognitive impairments of familial caregivers of AD patients during their caregiving-related chronic stress condition. Thirty-three caregivers (61.42 + 2.68 years; 27 women) and thirty-four controls (57.91 ± 2.16 years, 20 women) were evaluated for their cognitive functioning (attention, executive function, processing speed and memory) with a neuropsychological battery (Digit-span, Trail Making, Stroop and the Logical Memory tests). Subjects' cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) ratios were determined by radioimmunoassay, and their brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were analyzed by ELISA. An incidental contextual memory task, with or without an associative encoding instruction, was used to investigate if caregivers have a cognitive reserve prone to rehabilitation. The contextual memory impairment of caregivers was associated with prefrontal and hippocampal cognitive dysfunctions, alterations of the cortisol/DHEA ratio and lower BDNF levels. Even so, the contextual memory impairment could be improved by the associative encoding condition. This study suggests that the cognitive impairments of caregivers are not necessarily irreversible, as indicated by the results obtained for contextual memory, which could be improved despite the ongoing chronic stress and associated hormonal and neurotrophin dysfunctions. Lay summary The support of a relative with Alzheimer's Disease submits the familial caregivers to a chronic stress condition that increases their own risk of cognitive decline. This study suggests that, irrespective to their alterations on cortisol/DHEA ratio and BDNF levels, caregivers have a cognitive reserve that could probably be engaged to limit the negative effects of chronic stress on cognition.","['BDNF', 'Dementia', 'cognitive reserve', 'cognitive support', 'contextual memory', 'cortisol/DHEA']","Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2018-11-02,"[{'lastname': 'Corrêa', 'firstname': 'Márcio Silveira', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'a Laboratory of Biology and Development of the Nervous System, Faculty of Biosciences , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.\nb Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.\nc National Institute of Science and Technology for Translational Medicine (INCT-TM) , Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnologico (CNPq) , Brasília , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Lima', 'firstname': 'Daiane Borba', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'a Laboratory of Biology and Development of the Nervous System, Faculty of Biosciences , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Giacobbo', 'firstname': 'Bruno Lima', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'a Laboratory of Biology and Development of the Nervous System, Faculty of Biosciences , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.\nb Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.\nc National Institute of Science and Technology for Translational Medicine (INCT-TM) , Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnologico (CNPq) , Brasília , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Vedovelli', 'firstname': 'Kelem', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'a Laboratory of Biology and Development of the Nervous System, Faculty of Biosciences , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Argimon', 'firstname': 'Irani Iracema de Lima', 'initials': 'IIL', 'affiliation': 'd Institute of Geriatrics and Gerontology , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bromberg', 'firstname': 'Elke', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'a Laboratory of Biology and Development of the Nervous System, Faculty of Biosciences , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.\nb Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.\nc National Institute of Science and Technology for Translational Medicine (INCT-TM) , Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnologico (CNPq) , Brasília , Brazil.\nd Institute of Geriatrics and Gerontology , Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul , Porto Alegre , Brazil.'}]",,,,,10.1080/10253890.2018.1510485,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8d48540>
105,30368508,Neuroendocrine-Metabolic Dysfunction and Sleep Disturbances in Neurodegenerative Disorders: Focus on Alzheimer's Disease and Melatonin.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with altered eating behavior and metabolic disruption. Amyloid plaques and neurofilament tangles are observed in many hypothalamic nuclei from AD brains. Some of these areas (suprachiasmatic nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area) also play a role in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle and may explain the comorbidity of eating and sleep disorders observed in AD patients. Inadequate sleep increases the neurodegenerative process, for example, the decrease of slow-wave sleep impairs clearance of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and tau protein from cerebral interstitial fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) melatonin levels decrease even in preclinical stages (Braak-1 stage) when patients manifest no cognitive impairment, suggesting that reduction of melatonin in CSF may be an early marker (the cause for which is still unknown) of oncoming AD. Melatonin administration augments glymphatic clearance of Aβ and reduces generation and deposition of Aβ in transgenic animal models of AD. It may also set up a new equilibrium among hypothalamic feeding signals. While melatonin trials performed in the clinical phase of AD have failed to show or showed only modest positive effects on cognition, in the preclinical stage of dementia (minimal cognitive impairment) the effect of melatonin is demonstrable with significant improvement of sleep and quality of life. In this review, we discuss the main aspects of hypothalamic alterations in AD, the association between interrupted sleep and neurodegeneration, and the possible therapeutic effect of melatonin on these processes.","['Aging', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Feeding behavior', 'Glymphatic system', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin signaling', 'Melatonin', 'Sleep']",Neuroendocrinology,2018-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Spinedi', 'firstname': 'Eduardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Centre of Experimental and Applied Endocrinology (UNLP-CONICET-FCM), La Plata Medical School, La Plata National University, La Plata, Argentina, spinedi@cenexa.org.'}, {'lastname': 'Cardinali', 'firstname': 'Daniel P', 'initials': 'DP', 'affiliation': 'BIOMED-UCA-CONICET and Department of Teaching and Research, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}]",,,,"© 2018 S.

25030513",Female Sex and Alzheimer's Risk: The Menopause Connection.,"Along with advanced age and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-4 genotype, female sex is a major risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering that AD pathology begins decades prior to clinical symptoms, the higher risk in women cannot simply be accounted for by their greater longevity as compared to men. Recent investigation into sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms behind AD risk has implicated the menopause transition (MT), a midlife neuroendocrine transition state unique to females. Commonly characterized as ending in reproductive senescence, many symptoms of MT are neurological, including disruption of estrogen-regulated systems such as thermoregulation, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as depression and impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Preclinical studies have shown that, during MT, the estrogen network uncouples from the brain bioenergetic system. The resulting hypometabolic state could serve as the substrate for neurological dysfunction. Indeed, translational brain imaging studies demonstrate that 40-60 year-old perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exhibit an AD-endophenotype characterized by decreased metabolic activity and increased brain amyloid-beta deposition as compared to premenopausal women and to age-matched men. This review discusses the MT as a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions to compensate for brain bioenergetic crisis and combat the subsequent increased risk for AD in women.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Perimenopause', 'brain imaging', 'early detection', 'women']",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2018-10-10,"[{'lastname': 'Scheyer', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Lisa Mosconi, PhD, Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, 428 East 72nd St, Suite 500, Room 407, New York, NY, 10021; Tel: (212) 746-4624, Email: lim2035@med.cornell.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Rahman', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hristov', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Berkowitz', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Isaacson', 'firstname': 'R S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Diaz Brinton', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mosconi', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.14283/jpad.2018.34,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8d2e680>

Benefits from use of cannabinoid agents in epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and others have been suggested. It seems that the endocannabinoid system is also involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression, though its role in this mental disease has not been fully understood yet. Both the pro- and antidepressant activity have been reported after cannabis consumption and a number of pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that both agonist and antagonist of the endocannabinoid receptors act similarly to antidepressants. Responses to the cannabinoid agents are relatively fast, and most probably, the noradrenergic, serotoninergic, glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuroprotective activity, as well as modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are implicated in the observed effects. Based on the published data, the endocannabinoid system evidently gives novel ideas and options in the field of antidepressant treatment, however further studies are needed to determine which group of patients could benefit from this type of therapy.","['CB1 receptor', 'CB2 receptor', 'Depression', 'Endocannabinoids']",Life sciences,2018-10-06,"[{'lastname': 'Poleszak', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Chair and Department of Applied Pharmacy, Medical University of Lublin, Chodźki 1, PL, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.

Because of the complications associated with the pharmacological treatment, nonpharmacological treatment (such as physical activity) can be considered as an additional complementary treatment option for NPs. The aim of this review is to evaluate the impact of physical activity on NPs in patients with AD.
We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for potential eligible articles until March 1, 2018.
Although there are contradictory results showing the impact of physical exercise on NPs, most of them reported that it had a significant effect on depression and sleep disturbances in patients with AD.

Physical activity can also improve cardiovascular risk factors, which may exaggerate NPs. There is limited evidence for other NPs such as agitation, disinhibition, apathy, hallucinations, and anxiety.

Indeed, acute and chronic stress are high-risk factors for the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two devastating brain disorders associated with memory dysfunction. Besides the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, stress response also involves the activation of the opioid system in brain regions associated with stress regulation and memory processing. In this context, it is possible that stress-induced memory disorders may be attributed to alterations in the interaction between the neuroendocrine stress system and the opioid system. In this review, we: (1) describe the effects of acute and chronic stress on memory, and the modulatory role of the opioid system, (2) discuss the contribution of the opioid system to the pathophysiology of PTSD and AD, and (3) present evidence of current and potential therapies that target the opioid receptors to treat PTSD- and AD-associated symptoms.","['Memory', 'Neuropsychiatric stress disorders', 'Opioid System', 'Stress']",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2018-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'Torres-Berrio', 'firstname': 'Angélica', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Integrated Program in Neuroscience, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Nava-Mesa', 'firstname': 'Mauricio O', 'initials': 'MO', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Research Group (NEUROS), School of Medicine, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia.

Akebia saponin D (ASD) possesses numerous pharmacological activities, including as an anti-AD, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-diabetes, and anti-osteoporosis agent. The anti-AD effect of ASD is possibly through its regulation of glucocorticoid levels.
The present study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ASD on Aβ
The AD rat model was established by an intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ
Compared with the control group, AD rats displayed significant spatial learning and reference memory impairments, serious anxiety disorders, obvious hypertrophy of adrenal gland, elevated corticosterone and ACTH levels in the plasma, and increased 11β-HSD1 activity in liver and groin fat pad. ASD could significantly ameliorate the memory deficits and anxiety symptoms, markedly reduce the viscera coefficient of adrenal gland, observably decrease corticosterone and ACTH concentrations, and showed no effect on the activity of 11β-HSD1.
These results indicate that ASD might exert a significant neuroprotective effect on cognitive impairment, driven in part by reducing systemic corticosterone level by down-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.","['Akebia saponin D', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Corticosterone', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis']",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2018-08-10,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yuhui', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Jinyang', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'State Key laboratory of natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xiaolin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Research and Development in Marine Bio-resource Pharmaceutics, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Ye', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacy Department, Yangzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Zhonglin', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'State Key laboratory of natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Rufeng', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Chinese Medicines and the SATCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicines, Institute of Chinese Material Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA.

111,30011049,"Lifetime coffee consumption, pineal gland volume, and sleep quality in late life.","Previous studies have shown that coffee consumption may suppress the production of melatonin in pinealocytes through competitive inhibition of adenosine A2 receptors by caffeine. We investigated the impact of lifetime coffee consumption on pineal gland volume and the resulting effects on sleep quality.
We enrolled 162 cognitively normal elderly individuals among the participants in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia. We evaluated the patterns and amounts of coffee consumption using a study-specific standardized interview and assessed sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We measured the volume of pineal parenchyma (VPP) by manually segmenting the pineal gland on high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We examined the impact of lifetime coffee consumption on the VPP and the resulting effects on sleep quality using analysis of covariance, multiple linear regression, and mediation analyses.
We found that smaller VPP was associated with higher cumulative lifetime coffee consumption. Participants who consumed more than 60 cup-years of coffee had VPPs that were smaller by about 20% than individuals who consumed less than 60 cup-years of coffee. The VPP mediated the association between lifetime coffee consumption and sleep efficiency and quality.
Our findings suggest that high lifetime coffee consumption may reduce VPP, and that this reduction in VPP may impair the quality of sleep in late life.",[],Sleep,2018-07-17,"[{'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Jeongbin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Brain and Cognitive Science, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Ji Won', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Ju Ri', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Byun', 'firstname': 'Seonjeong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Suh', 'firstname': 'Seung Wan', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Tae', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering and School of Life Sciences, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoon', 'firstname': 'In Young', 'initials': 'IY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ki Woong', 'initials': 'KW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Brain and Cognitive Science, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, South Korea.\nDepartment of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}]",,,We found that smaller VPP was associated with higher cumulative lifetime coffee consumption.

28825348",Into the Moment: Does Mindfulness Affect Biological Pathways in Multiple Sclerosis?,"Mindfulness was introduced in the Western world by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979. He defined it as ""awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally."" Since then, research on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) has increased exponentially both in health and disease, including in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Parkinson's disease. Research on the effect of mindfulness and multiple sclerosis (MS) only recently gained interest. Several studies completed since 2010 provided evidence that mindfulness improves quality of life (QoL), depression and fatigue in MS patients. In addition to patient-reported outcome measures, potential effects on cognitive function have been investigated only to a very limited extent. However, research on laboratory biomarkers and neuroimaging, capable to deliver proof-of-concept of this behavioral treatment in MS, is mainly lacking. In this perspective, we illustrate possible neurobiological mechanisms, including the tripartite interaction between the brain, the immune system and neuroendocrine regulation, through which this treatment might affect multiple sclerosis symptoms. We propose to (1) include immunological and/or neuroimaging biomarkers as standard outcome measures in future research dedicated to mindfulness and MS to help explain the clinical improvements seen in fatigue and depression; (2) to investigate effects on enhancing cognitive reserve and cognitive function; and (3) to investigate the effects of mindfulness on the disease course in MS.","['MRI', 'cognitive function', 'depression', 'fatigue', 'immune system', 'mindfulness', 'multiple sclerosis', 'stress']",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Willekens', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium.\nLaboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Perrotta', 'firstname': 'Gaetano', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, ULB-Hôpital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Cras', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium.\nDepartment of Neurology, Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nDepartment of Neurology, Laboratory for Neurobiology, Born-Bunge Institute, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Cools', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}]",,,,,"10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00103

27096930",Knowledge-Based Neuroendocrine Immunomodulation (NIM) Molecular Network Construction and Its Application.,"Growing evidence shows that the neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) network plays an important role in maintaining and modulating body function and the homeostasis of the internal environment. The disequilibrium of NIM in the body is closely associated with many diseases. In the present study, we first collected a core dataset of NIM signaling molecules based on our knowledge and obtained 611 NIM signaling molecules. Then, we built a NIM molecular network based on the MetaCore database and analyzed the signaling transduction characteristics of the core network. We found that the endocrine system played a pivotal role in the bridge between the nervous and immune systems and the signaling transduction between the three systems was not homogeneous. Finally, employing the forest algorithm, we identified the molecular hub playing an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), based on the NIM molecular network constructed by us.

115,29782957,The role of monoamines in the development of Alzheimer's disease and neuroprotective effect of a proline rich polypeptide.,"We have analyzed the alterations in the brain monoaminergic system using the rat model of AD-like pathology. In addition, we have investigated potential neuroprotective effects of the hypothalamic proline-rich polypeptide (PRP-1).
Histochemical staining, HPLC, chemiluminescent and bioluminescence assays.
The levels of monoamines in the target AD brain structures were found elevated, except serotonin, which was unaffected in both hippocampus and brainstem and decreased in frontal cortex. This was accompanied by the substantial structural damage of cortical, hippocampal, as well as the monoaminergic neurons of locus coeruleus and oxidative stress. PRP-1 was able to reverse most of these changes.
The increased levels of major brain monoamines in the model of AD supports the hypothesis of the important role of monoamines in the excessive synaptic excitation resulting in cognitive dysfunction in AD brain. The neuroprotective effect of PRP-1 as manifested by the recovery of monoaminergic system suggests this bioactive compound as a perspective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Monoamines', 'Oxidative stress', 'PRP-1']",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2018-05-22,"[{'lastname': 'Yenkoyan', 'firstname': 'Konstantin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Yerevan State Medical University after M.

116,29732634,Berberine: Pathways to protect neurons.,"Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, is demonstrated to have a variety of pharmacologic effects. Widely used as nonprescription drug for diarrhea, berberine has also broadened its applications in therapies of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, tumor, and so forth. However, researches about berberine's protective effects on nervous system are still so insufficient that clinical uses cannot popularize and underlying molecules mechanisms are confused and incomplete. Well-known pathways such as Pl3K/Akt/Bcl-2 pathway, Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway help berberine to protect neurons through antiapoptotic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory activities. New hypotheses have been raised consistently to explore more possible ways of berberine preventing nerves from injuries as attention on its neuroprotective properties is increasing. Therefore, this review is trying to analyze these mechanisms, which actually play roles in neuronal disease models such as brain ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Much more understanding about how berberine mediates these pathways provides novel insights into the clinical treatment of neurological disorders.","['berberine', 'mechanism', 'neuroprotection']",Phytotherapy research : PTR,2018-05-08,"[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Xiaorui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Second Department of Clinical Medicine, China Medical University, No. 77 Puhe Road, Shenyang, 110122, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Nan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroendocrine Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, No. 77 Puhe Road, Shenyang, 110122, PR China.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/ptr.6107,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8efbd60>
117,29689315,Stress as risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.,"Prolonged stress predisposes susceptible individuals to a number of physiological disorders including cardiovascular disease, obesity and gastrointestinal disorders, as well as psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical studies have suggested that manipulation of the glucocorticoid milieu can trigger cellular, molecular and behavioral derangement resembling the hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). For example, stress or glucocorticoid administration can increase amyloid ß precursor protein and tau phosphorylation which are involved in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death associated with AD. Although since AD was first described in 1906 at a conference in Tubingen, Germany by Alois Alzheimer our knowledge of neuropathological and neurochemical alterations of AD has been impressively increased, at present, pharmacotherapy is symptomatic at best and has no influence on the progression of the disorder. It is generally believed that most of the drugs developed as disease modifiers have failed in clinical trials because treatment started too late, i.e., after the clinical onset of AD. Because AD pathology begins several years prior to the clinical diagnosis, it is imperative to identify subjects at high risk to develop the disorder. Consequently, the search for putative risk factors has gained importance. ApoE4, diabetes/metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disorders, and a low cognitive reserve are established risk factors for AD. The focus of this review is on stress and glucocorticoids as potential factors increasing the risk to develop AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Animal model', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Risk factor', 'Stress']",Pharmacological research,2018-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Caruso', 'firstname': 'Alessandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Sapienza Università di Roma, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Nicoletti', 'firstname': 'Ferdinando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Sapienza Università di Roma, Italy; I.R.C.C.S.

5769839",Cystic tumors of the pituitary infundibulum: seminal autopsy specimens (1899 to 1904) that allowed clinical-pathological craniopharyngioma characterization.,"A heterogeneous group of epithelial cystic tumors developed at the infundibulum and the third ventricle disconcerted pathologists at the dawn of the twentieth century. Very little was known at that time about the physiological role played by the pituitary gland, and there was almost complete ignorance regarding the function of the hypothalamus. Acromegaly, or enlargement of acral body parts, described in 1886 by Pierre Marie, was the only disease linked to primary hypertrophies of the pituitary gland, known as ""pituitary strumas"". A growing number of young patients manifesting an unexplained combination of physical and mental symptoms, including absent or delayed sexual maturation, progressive obesity, abnormal somnolence, and dementia-like changes in behavior were reported to present large solid-cystic tumors which characteristically expanded within the infundibulum and third ventricle, above an anatomically intact pituitary gland. Between 1899 and 1904, five seminal autopsy studies from different countries thoroughly described the anatomical relationships and histological features of this newly recognized type of infundibular tumors. These cases were instrumental in fostering the systematic investigation of similar lesions by the Austrian pathologist Jakob Erdheim (1874-1937), who in 1904 was able to classify these infundibulo-tuberal cysts under the common category of hypophyseal duct tumors. The pioneering American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing (1869-1939) unsuccessfully attempted to surgically remove one of these cysts, for the first time in history, in 1902. The term ""craniopharyngioma"", chosen by Cushing in 1929 to designate these lesions, would eventually prevail over Erdheim's more accurate denomination, which linked their origin to squamous cell remnants derived from the embryological structures that give rise to the pituitary gland. This paper presents a comprehensive, renewed account of the five clinical-pathological reports which laid the groundwork for the proper clinical diagnosis, topographic conceptualization and pathological categorization of craniopharyngiomas.","['Craniopharyngioma', 'Fröhlich’s syndrome', 'Hypothalamus', 'Infundibulum', 'Jakob Erdheim', 'Pituitary gland', 'Rathke’s pouch', 'Sir Frederick Mott']",Pituitary,2018-04-24,"[{'lastname': 'Pascual', 'firstname': 'José M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, La Princesa University Hospital, C/Diego de León 62, 28006, Madrid, Spain. jmpasncj@hotmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Prieto', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosdolsky', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Independent Medical Translator, Jenkintown, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Strauss', 'firstname': 'Sewan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Dahme-Spreewald, Königs Wusterhausen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Castro-Dufourny', 'firstname': 'Inés', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Sureste University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Hofecker', 'firstname': 'Verena', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Pathologisch-anatomische Sammlung im Narrenturm-NHM, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Winter', 'firstname': 'Eduard', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Pathologisch-anatomische Sammlung im Narrenturm-NHM, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Carrasco', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ramón y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ulrich', 'firstname': 'Walter', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Clinical Bacteriology, Jakob Erdheim Institute, Vienna, Austria.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s11102-018-0889-z,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8eec220>
119,29656013,Escitalopram alleviates stress-induced Alzheimer's disease-like tau pathologies and cognitive deficits by reducing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity and insulin/GSK-3β signal pathway activity.,"Chronic stress, a causal factor for depression, can also cause cognitive impairments and tau pathology. However, whether and how the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant escitalopram ameliorates these effects are still unclear. In the present study, rats were subjected to chronic mild unpredictable stress for 8 weeks. Following the initial 4 weeks, the stressed animals were separated into susceptible (depressive) and unsusceptible (resistant) groups based on behavioral tests. Then, escitalopram (10 mg/kg i.p.) was administered for 28 days. Pathophysiological changes were assessed by performing behavioral and biochemical analyses. The results showed that both depressive and resistant rats displayed spatial memory deficits and an accumulation of tau in the hippocampus. Increased levels of corticosterone and insulin and a decreased level of glucocorticoid receptor were found in both depressive and resistant rats. We also found that activity-dependent phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Ser9 site) were significantly decreased in both depressive and resistant rats. However, other important kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/2, did not change in our study. Furthermore, we found that the mRNA expression of tau was increased in depressive and resistant rats. No significant change in LC3B expression was found. Interestingly, almost all the pathological changes in depressive and resistant rats previously mentioned could be reversed by escitalopram. Our results suggested that escitalopram ameliorates cognitive impairments and selectively attenuates phosphorylated tau accumulation in stressed rats through the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and the insulin receptor substrate/glycogen synthase kinase-3β signaling pathway.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Chronic stress', 'Escitalopram', 'Tau']",Neurobiology of aging,2018-04-16,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Chao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated ZhongDa Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Wei-Gang', 'initials': 'WG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated ZhongDa Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yan-Juan', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated ZhongDa Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Jun-Jun', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated ZhongDa Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Hong', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated ZhongDa Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Zhi-Jun', 'initials': 'ZJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated ZhongDa Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ren', 'firstname': 'Qing-Guo', 'initials': 'QG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated ZhongDa Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.

28526554",Physiological changes in neurodegeneration - mechanistic insights and clinical utility.,"The effects of neurodegenerative syndromes extend beyond cognitive function to involve key physiological processes, including eating and metabolism, autonomic nervous system function, sleep, and motor function. Changes in these physiological processes are present in several conditions, including frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and the parkinsonian plus conditions. Key neural structures that mediate physiological changes across these conditions include neuroendocrine and hypothalamic pathways, reward pathways, motor systems and the autonomic nervous system. In this Review, we highlight the key changes in physiological processing in neurodegenerative syndromes and the similarities in these changes between different progressive neurodegenerative brain conditions. The changes and similarities between disorders might provide novel insights into the human neural correlates of physiological functioning. Given the evidence that physiological changes can arise early in the neurodegenerative process, these changes could provide biomarkers to aid in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and in treatment trials.",[],Nature reviews.

10494443",Associations between CSF cortisol and CSF norepinephrine in cognitively normal controls and patients with amnestic MCI and AD dementia.,"This study evaluated the effects of Alzheimer disease (AD) on the relationship between the brain noradrenergic system and hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPA). Specifically, relationships between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) norepinephrine (NE) and CSF cortisol were examined in cognitively normal participants and participants with AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). We hypothesized that there would a positive association between these 2 measures in cognitively normal controls and that this association would be altered in AD.
Four hundred twenty-one CSF samples were assayed for NE and cortisol in controls (n = 305), participants with aMCI (n = 22), and AD dementia (n = 94). Linear regression was used to examine the association between CSF cortisol and NE, adjusting for age, sex, education, and body mass index.
Contrary to our hypothesis, CSF cortisol and NE levels were not significantly associated in controls. However, higher cortisol levels were associated with higher NE levels in AD and aMCI participants. Regression coefficients ± standard errors for the change in cortisol per 100-pg/mL increase in NE are as follows: controls 0.0 ± 0.2, P = 1.0; MCI, 1.4 ± 0.7, P = .14; and AD 1.1 ± 0.4, P = .032. Analysis with MCI and AD participants combined strengthened statistical significance (1.2 ± 0.3, P = .007).
Enhanced responsiveness of the HPA axis to noradrenergic stimulatory regulation in AD and disruption of the blood brain barrier may contribute to these findings. Because brainstem noradrenergic stimulatory regulation of the HPA axis is substantially increased by both acute and chronic stress, these findings are also consistent with AD participants experiencing higher levels of acute and chronic stress.","['Alzheimer disease', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'cortisol', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'norepinephrine', 'stress']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2018-02-16,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Lucy Y', 'initials': 'LY', 'affiliation': 'Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Raskind', 'firstname': 'Murray A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilkinson', 'firstname': 'Charles W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shofer', 'firstname': 'Jane B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sikkema', 'firstname': 'Carl', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Szot', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Quinn', 'firstname': 'Joseph F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Galasko', 'firstname': 'Douglas R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Peskind', 'firstname': 'Elaine R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}]",,,"Contrary to our hypothesis, CSF cortisol and NE levels were not significantly associated in controls.

26362436",Public health impact of androgens.,"To summarize recent findings regarding the public health impact of androgen abuse.
Abuse of androgens (also called 'anabolic-androgenic steroids') has grown into a major worldwide substance abuse problem involving tens of millions of individuals, of whom about 98% are men. Most androgen abusers are still under age 50 today, and thus, the long-term effects of these drugs are only beginning to be understood. Recent studies confirm that long-term supraphysiologic androgen exposure produces cardiovascular toxicity, characterized especially by cardiomyopathy and atherosclerotic disease. Withdrawal from androgens after long-term use may produce prolonged and sometimes irreversible hypogonadism in men. Supraphysiologic androgen levels may sometimes cause irritability, aggressiveness, and violence, whereas androgen withdrawal may cause depression. However, these psychiatric effects are idiosyncratic, affecting only a minority of users. Emerging evidence now also suggests that long-term androgen exposure may cause neurotoxicity, raising the possibility that aging androgen abusers may be at increased risk for dementia. Several recent studies have also described androgen-induced hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and adverse musculoskeletal effects.
Recent studies have demonstrated marked adverse effects of long-term androgen abuse. As increasing numbers of androgen abusers reach middle age, these effects will likely represent an emerging public health problem.",[],"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2018-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Kanayama', 'firstname': 'Gen', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, McLean Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaufman', 'firstname': 'Marc J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pope', 'firstname': 'Harrison G', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/MED.0000000000000404,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d93b1e00>

125,29071701,[The hypothalamus in Huntington's disease].,"Disorders affecting sleep and the circadian rhythm, autonomic clinical signs and symptoms, and neuroendocrine alterations are frequent characteristics in Huntington's disease, some of which present in early stages of the disease. It is reasonable to think that some of these features could result from a hypothalamic dysfunction affecting the centre regulating sleep, metabolism and the autonomic nervous system.
The study presents the evidence available to date that suggests the involvement of a hypothalamic disorder in Huntington's disease.
Histopathological, hormonal and neuroimaging research relates this area of the brain to Huntington's disease. The experimental findings and those obtained with animal models or in studies conducted with patients are summarised. Likewise, the clinical repercussions (sleep and circadian rhythm disorders, psychiatric and cognitive pathologies, and the clinical signs and symptoms linked to autonomic dysfunction) secondary to possible involvement of the hypothalamus in this disease are also described.
The hypothalamus acts as a centre that integrates the neuroendocrine and autonomic functions, and plays a significant role in cognitive and behavioural signs and symptoms. Disorders of this type have been highlighted in Huntington's disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role and scope of this region of the brain in this disease.
El hipotalamo en la enfermedad de Huntington.
Introduccion. Los trastornos del sueño y del ritmo circadiano, la sintomatologia autonomica y las alteraciones neuroendocrinas son caracteristicas frecuentes de la enfermedad de Huntington, y algunos de ellos se presentan en estadios tempranos de ella. Es plausible pensar que algunos de estos rasgos podrian ser el resultado de una disfuncion hipotalamica del centro regulador del sueño, el metabolismo y el sistema nervioso autonomo. Objetivo. Se exponen las evidencias disponibles hasta el momento actual que sugieren una afectacion hipotalamica en la enfermedad de Huntington. Desarrollo. Investigaciones histopatologicas, hormonales y de neuroimagen relacionan esta region cerebral con la enfermedad de Huntington. Se resumen los hallazgos, tanto experimentales como en modelos animales, o en estudios realizados con pacientes. Asimismo, se describen las repercusiones clinicas (alteraciones del sueño y del ritmo circadiano, la patologia psiquiatrica y cognitiva, y la clinica vinculada con disfuncion autonomica) secundarias a una posible afectacion hipotalamica en esta enfermedad. Conclusiones. El hipotalamo se comporta como un centro integrador de las funciones neuroendocrinas y autonomicas, y presenta un papel no desdeñable sobre la sintomatologia cognitiva y conductual. Alteraciones al respecto se han destacado en la enfermedad de Huntington.

Materials and Methods The ethics committee approved this retrospective study. The participants included 63 patients with AD, 33 patients with MCI, and 24 healthy control subjects. There were 36 men and 84 women, with a mean age (±standard deviation) of 76.7 years ± 7.6. The pineal gland volume and pineal parenchymal volume were measured by using three-dimensional volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence; spatial resolution, 0.9 × 0.98 × 0.98 mm).

20123029","PCLO rs2522833-mediated gray matter volume reduction in patients with drug-naive, first-episode major depressive disorder.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been linked to differences in the volume of certain areas of the brain and to variants in the piccolo presynaptic cytomatrix protein (PCLO), but the relationship between PCLO and brain morphology has not been studied. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PCLO, rs2522833, is thought to affect protein stability and the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We investigated the relationship between cortical volume and this SNP in first-episode, drug-naive patients with MDD or healthy control subjects. Seventy-eight participants, including 30 patients with MDD and 48 healthy control subjects, were recruited via interview. PCLO rs2522833 genotyping and plasma cortisol assays were performed, and gray matter volume was estimated using structural magnetic resonance images. Among the individuals carrying the C-allele of PCLO rs2522833, the volume of the left temporal pole was significantly smaller in those with MDD than in healthy controls (family-wise error-corrected, P=0.003). No differences were detected in other brain regions. In addition, the C-carriers showed a larger volume reduction in the left temporal pole than those in the individuals with A/A genotype (P=0.0099). Plasma cortisol levels were significantly higher in MDD-affected C-carriers than in the healthy control C-carriers (12.76±6.10 vs 9.31±3.60 nm, P=0.045).

17612038",Care Transitions and Adult Day Services Moderate the Longitudinal Links between Stress Biomarkers and Family Caregivers' Functional Health.,"Stress biomarkers have been linked to health and well-being. There are, however, few studies on how dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system actually affects functional health of family caregivers of persons with dementia. Further, it is not clear whether and how factors affecting caregiving stressor exposures such as care transitions and adult day services (ADS) use may affect such association.
First, to examine the association of daily stress biomarkers and functional health over time among family caregivers of persons with dementia. Second, to examine effects of care transitions and ADS use on the association between baseline stress biomarkers and functional health over time.
At baseline, caregivers provided 5 saliva samples each day during an 8-day diary study, where all caregivers were having a varying number of ADS days per week. There were 2 longitudinal follow-ups at 6 and 12 months on ADS use, care transitions, and caregivers' functional health. The average daily total output across days was computed at baseline for salivary cortisol, the sulfated form of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA-s), and salivary alpha amylase (sAA), which were used as predictors of caregivers' longitudinal functional limitation trajectories. Care transitions and total number of ADS days per week at baseline were considered as moderators of the associations between stress biomarkers and health over time.
The associations between functional limitation trajectories and daily total outputs of cortisol and sAA were modified by ADS use and care transitions. Among caregivers who experienced a transition, and who used less than average ADS days per week, lower daily cortisol total output and lower daily sAA total output were associated with increasing functional limitations. Caregivers who experienced a transition but used greater than average ADS days per week did not show such patterns of association. No significant effect was found for DHEA-s.
The study contributes to an important but largely unanswered question regarding implications of stress biomarkers on functional health. Assessments of the association between stress biomarkers and health among family caregivers of persons with dementia need to consider changes in stressor exposures over time, such as care transitions and ADS use.","['Adult day services', 'Care transitions', 'Family caregiver', 'Functional health over time', 'Stress biomarkers']",Gerontology,2017-05-19,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Center for Healthy Aging, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Almeida', 'firstname': 'David M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rovine', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zarit', 'firstname': 'Steven H', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': None}]",,"The study contributes to an important but largely unanswered question regarding implications of stress biomarkers on functional health.

131,28456142,Endogenous glucocorticoids: role in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Endogenous glucocorticoids (eGCs) are steroid hormones with a wide spectrum of physiological effects. However, enhanced basal eGCs levels have been observed in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and they have been correlated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, hippocampal degeneration and reduced cognitive/memory performance. Therefore, it has been proposed that elevated concentration of eGCs might have a role in AD pathogenesis. AD is the most common form of dementia, characterized by the pathological accumulation of two proteins: the Amyloid Beta (Aβ) and the microtubule-associated protein tau in the neurons of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In particular, the hippocampus, the cerebral area involved in learning and memory, is the brain region more vulnerable to chronic eGCs exposure. Although clinical studies have failed to establish a direct causative link between eGCs e and AD pathogenesis, evidences from pre-clinical studies have shown that increased eGCs levels accelerate the formation of Aβ in AD animal models by promoting the amyloidogenic pathway, and in parallel by reducing Aβ clearance, through transcriptional mechanisms involving the Glucocorticoid receptors. Instead, the effects of stress on tau phosphorylation seem to be mainly mediated bv the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR1) and independent from stress-induced eGCs elevation.",[],Neuro endocrinology letters,2017-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Libro', 'firstname': 'Rosaliana', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Centro Neurolesi ""Bonino-Pulejo"", Via Provinciale Palermo, Contrada Casazza, Messina, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bramanti', 'firstname': 'Placido', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Centro Neurolesi ""Bonino-Pulejo"", Via Provinciale Palermo, Contrada Casazza, Messina, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mazzon', 'firstname': 'Emanuela', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Centro Neurolesi ""Bonino-Pulejo"", Via Provinciale Palermo, Contrada Casazza, Messina, Italy.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9859ef0>
132,28337631,Upregulation of Mineralocorticoid Receptor in the Hypothalamus Associated with a High Anxiety-like Level in Apolipoprotein E4 Transgenic Mice.,"Anxiety symptoms occur in a large portion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. ApolipoproteinE-4 (ApoE ε4 allele), a risk factor for AD, has been recognized as an important contributor to psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the corticosterone level in relation to anxiety-like behavior changes in transgenic male mice with different glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-ApoE isoforms. GFAP-ApoE4 transgenic mice aged 3 months showed higher anxiety-like behavior in open field, light-dark box and elevated plus maze tasks compared with that of age-matched GFAP-ApoE3 mice. However, corticotropin releasing factor levels in the hypothalamus and plasma corticosterone secretion were similar in GFAP-ApoE3 and GFAP-ApoE4 transgenic male mice. Additionally, increased expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and unchanged expression of the glucocorticoid receptor were observed in the hypothalamus of GFAP-ApoE4 mice. However, no significant differences were found in the expression levels of the MR in GFAP-ApoE3 and GFAP-ApoE4 mice at postnatal day 2. In conclusion, we found that MR upregulation rather than corticosterone level changes in the early stage of adulthood was associated with the higher anxiety-like level measured in GFAP-ApoE4 mice.","['Anxiety-like', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Corticotropin releasing factor', 'Glucocorticoid receptor', 'Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis', 'Mineralocorticoid receptor']",Behavior genetics,2017-03-25,"[{'lastname': 'Meng', 'firstname': 'Fan-Tao', 'initials': 'FT', 'affiliation': ""CAS Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Diseases, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CAS Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Diseases, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, Anhui, People's Republic of China. zjun@mail.ustc.edu.cn.\nInstitute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, People's Republic of China. zjun@mail.ustc.edu.cn.""}, {'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""CAS Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Diseases, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Li-Feng', 'initials': 'LF', 'affiliation': ""CAS Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Diseases, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Hui-Mei', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': ""Anhui Geriatric Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Ya-Jing', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Center for Reproductive Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, Anhui, People's Republic of China. yjl@ustc.edu.cn.\nCAS Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Diseases, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, Anhui, People's Republic of China. yjl@ustc.edu.cn.""}]",,,,,10.1007/s10519-017-9843-5,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d985d3b0>

Nine-month-old female mice with senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) were divided into three groups: the disease model, EA-Guanyuan and EA-Sanyinjiao groups. Concurrently, 9-month old female mice with senescence-accelerated mouse resistance 1 (SAMR1) were set as the control model group. The two treatment groups were given the same pattern of EA stimulation. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Serum estradiol levels in the Hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the HPO axis function level. Spatial learning and memory were assessed by the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test.
(a) HPO axis: compared with the control model group, the disease model group displayed a decrease in E2 levels (P < 0.01), and an increase in GnRH, LH and FSH levels (P < 0.01). E2 levels were increased in EA treatment groups compared with the disease model group (P < 0.05). In contrast, GnRH and LH and FSH levels were reduced (P < 0.05). EA-Sanyinjiao group was superior than EA-Guanyuan group on increasing E2 and declining GnRH levels (P < 0.01). (b) The MWM test demonstrated that the response latency in the EA-Sanyinjiao treatment group declined from day 2 to day 5 compared with the disease model group (P < 0.05), whereas the EA-Guanyuan treatment group showed no significant difference.
EA can regulate hormone (E2, FSH, LH, GnRH) levels in the HPO axis and the spatial learning and memory ability in female SAMP8 mice.

134,29560886,"Plasma Cortisol, Brain Amyloid-β, and Cognitive Decline in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: A 6-Year Prospective Cohort Study.","Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, which is typically assessed by measuring cortisol levels, is associated with cognitive dysfunction, hippocampal atrophy, and increased risk for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation in moderating the effect of high levels of amyloid-β (Aβ+) on cognitive decline in the preclinical phase of AD, which is often protracted, and thus offers opportunities for prevention and early intervention.
Using data from a 6-year multicenter prospective cohort study, we evaluated the relation between Aβ level, plasma cortisol level, and cognitive decline in 416 cognitively normal older adults.
Results revealed that Aβ+ older adults experienced faster decline than Aβ- older adults in all cognitive domains (Cohen's d at 6-year assessment = 0.37-0.65). They further indicated a significant interaction between Aβ and cortisol levels for global cognition (d = 0.32), episodic memory (d = 0.50), and executive function (d = 0.59) scores, with Aβ+ older adults with high cortisol levels having significantly faster decline in these domains compared with Aβ+ older adults with low cortisol levels. These effects were independent of age, sex, APOE genotype, anxiety symptoms, and radiotracer type.
In cognitively healthy older adults, Aβ+ is associated with greater cognitive decline and high plasma cortisol levels may accelerate the effect of Aβ+ on decline in global cognition, episodic memory, and executive function. These results suggest that therapies targeted toward lowering plasma cortisol and Aβ levels may be helpful in mitigating cognitive decline in the preclinical phase of AD.","['Aging', 'Amyloid', 'Cognition', 'Cortisol', 'Epidemiology', 'Memory']",Biological psychiatry.

17350477","LW-AFC, a new formula derived from Liuwei Dihuang decoction, ameliorates behavioral and pathological deterioration via modulating the neuroendocrine-immune system in PrP-hAβPPswe/PS1","Accumulating evidence implicates the neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) network in the physiopathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, we previously revealed that the NIM network is dysregulated in the PrP-hAβPPswe/PS1
After treatment with a novel Liuwei Dihuang formula (LW-AFC), mice were cognitively evaluated in behavioral experiments. Neuron loss, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and Aβ level were analyzed using Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, and an AlphaLISA assay, respectively. Multiplex bead analysis, a radioimmunoassay, immunochemiluminometry, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to measure cytokine and hormone levels. Lymphocyte subsets were detected using flow cytometry. Data between two groups were compared using a Student's t test. Comparison of the data from multiple groups against one group was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Dunnett's post hoc test or a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with a Tukey multiple comparisons test.
LW-AFC ameliorated the cognitive impairment observed in APP/PS1 mice, including the impairment of object recognition memory, spatial learning and memory, and active and passive avoidance. In addition, LW-AFC alleviated the neuron loss in the hippocampus, suppressed Aβ deposition in the brain, and reduced the concentration of Aβ
LW-AFC ameliorated the behavioral and pathological deterioration of APP/PS1 transgenic mice via the restoration of the NIM network to a greater extent than either memantine or donepezil, which supports the use of LW-AFC as a potential agent for AD therapy.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Amyloid-β', 'Cytokine', 'LW-AFC', 'Lymphocyte subset', 'Neuroendocrine', 'Neuron loss', 'PrP-hAβPPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenic mouse', 'cognitive behavior']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2016-12-15,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jian-Hui', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lei', 'firstname': 'Xi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China.\nGuangxi Medical University, Nanning, 530021, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Rui', 'initials': 'XR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China. cxr916@163.com.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China. cxr916@163.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Rui', 'initials': 'XR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Gang', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Jun-Ping', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yi-Ran', 'initials': 'YR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Ju', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Wen-Xia', 'initials': 'WX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China. zhouwx@bmi.ac.cn.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China. zhouwx@bmi.ac.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yong-Xiang', 'initials': 'YX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China. zhangyx@bmi.ac.cn.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, 100850, China. zhangyx@bmi.ac.cn.'}]",,,"LW-AFC ameliorated the cognitive impairment observed in APP/PS1 mice, including the impairment of object recognition memory, spatial learning and memory, and active and passive avoidance.

136,27857051,Elevation of the ACTH/cortisol ratio in female opioid dependent patients: A biomarker of aging and correlate of metabolic and immune activation.,"Whilst the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) Axis is a major stress axis, and is necessarily perturbed in opioid dependency, and stress is a major contributor to aging mechanisms, the HPA axis has not been studied in opioid dependency in an age-dependent manner.
Hypothesis - Differences in age dependent levels of HPA components.
Cross-sectional comparison of general medical and opioid dependent patients (ODP, GMP). Setting - Primary Care. Patients - 51 GMC, 233 ODP. Ages 37.92+1.95 v. 37.12+0.62 years (P - N.S.) and 33.33% v. 71.67% male (p<0.0001). Intervention(s) - Measurement ACTH, cortisol and their ratio (ACR). Main Outcome Measure(s) - Pre-planned analysis ACR.
Impact of immune and metabolic markers.
ACTH/cortisol was a negative biomarker for age in female patients. Whilst the mean ACR were not different, the (log) ACTH/cortisol showed a positive relationship with age:sex:status (p=0.0396) and age:status (p=0.0437). The effect of addictive status was confined to hepatitis C (HCV) positive female ODP (p=0.0355), and the age:status interaction was also stronger in female HCV+ (p=0.0075) compared to HCV - (p=0.0667) patients. Multiple regression of ACR against age, status, ALT, CRP, and Globulins confirmed many significant interactions. ACTH/cortisol ratio interacted significantly from p=0.0008 in males and p=0.0079 in females, and in both sexes four terms included addictive status.
These data establish the ACTH/cortisol ratio as a negative biomarker of aging in females, and show that this decline is more pronounced in ODP an effect which is partly related to HCV seropositivity, immune and metabolic factors.

137,27637496,Neuroendocrine and neurotrophic signaling in Huntington's disease: Implications for pathogenic mechanisms and treatment strategies.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by an extended polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. Circadian, sleep and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbances are observed in HD as early as 15 years before clinical disease onset. Disturbances in these key processes result in increased cortisol and altered melatonin release which may negatively impact on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and contribute to documented neuropathological and clinical disease features. This review describes the normal interactions between neurotrophic factors, the HPA-axis and circadian rhythm, as indicated by levels of BDNF, cortisol and melatonin, and the alterations in these intricately balanced networks in HD. We also discuss the implications of these alterations on the neurobiology of HD and the potential to result in hypothalamic, circadian, and sleep pathologies. Measurable alterations in these pathways provide targets that, if treated early, may reduce degeneration of brain structures. We therefore focus here on the means by which multidisciplinary therapy could be utilised as a non-pharmaceutical approach to restore the balance of these pathways.","['Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)', 'Circadian rhythm', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis', 'Hypothalamus', 'Sleep', 'Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)']",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2016-10-30,"[{'lastname': 'Bartlett', 'firstname': 'Danielle M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, 270 Joondalup Drive, Perth, Australia.

138,27607343,Gastric acid secretion.,"The present review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding neuroendocrine and intracellular regulation of gastric acid secretion and proper use of antisecretory medications.
Gastric acid kills microorganisms, modulates the gut microbiome, assists in digestion of protein, and facilitates absorption of iron, calcium, and vitamin B12. The main stimulants of acid secretion are gastrin, released from antral G cells; histamine, released from oxyntic enterochromaffin-like cells; and acetylcholine, released from antral and oxyntic intramural neurons. Other stimulants include ghrelin, motilin, and hydrogen sulfide. The main inhibitor of acid secretion is somatostatin, released from oxyntic and antral D cells. Glucagon-like peptide-1 also inhibits acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce acid secretion and, as a result, decrease somatostatin and thus stimulate gastrin secretion. Although considered well tolerated drugs, concerns have been raised this past year regarding associations between PPI use and kidney disease, dementia, and myocardial infarction; the quality of evidence, however, is very low.
Our understanding of the physiology of gastric secretion and proper use of PPIs continues to advance. Such knowledge is crucial for improved management of acid-peptic disorders.",[],Current opinion in gastroenterology,2016-10-18,"[{'lastname': 'Schubert', 'firstname': 'Mitchell L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond and Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000308,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d868b130>
139,27459932,New selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators reverse amyloid-β peptide-induced hippocampus toxicity.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive deficits and psychological symptoms are associated with an early deregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Here, in an acute model of AD, we investigated if antiglucocorticoid strategies with selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulators (CORT108297 and CORT113176) that combine antagonistic and agonistic GR properties could offer an interesting therapeutic approach in the future. We confirm the expected properties of the nonselective GR antagonist (mifepristone) because in addition to restoring basal circulating glucocorticoids levels, mifepristone totally reverses synaptic deficits and hippocampal apoptosis processes. However, mifepristone only partially reverses cognitive deficit, effects of the hippocampal amyloidogenic pathway, and neuroinflammatory processes, suggesting limits in its efficacy. By contrast, selective GR modulators CORT108297 and CORT113176 at a dose of 20 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, reverse hippocampal amyloid-β peptide generation, neuroinflammation, and apoptotic processes, restore the hippocampal levels of synaptic markers, re-establish basal plasma levels of glucocorticoids, and improve cognitive function. In conclusion, selective GR modulators are particularly attractive and may pave the way to new strategies for AD treatment.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Amyloid-β peptide', 'Aβ(25–35) peptide', 'Glucocorticoid receptors', 'HPA axis', 'Hippocampus', 'Rat', 'Selective GR modulator']",Neurobiology of aging,2016-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Pineau', 'firstname': 'Fanny', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U1198, Montpellier, France; University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; EPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Canet', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U1198, Montpellier, France; University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; EPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Desrumaux', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U1198, Montpellier, France; University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; EPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Hunt', 'firstname': 'Hazel', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Corcept Therapeutics, Menlo Park, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chevallier', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U1198, Montpellier, France; University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; EPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ollivier', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U1198, Montpellier, France; University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; EPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Belanoff', 'firstname': 'Joseph K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Corcept Therapeutics, Menlo Park, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Givalois', 'firstname': 'Laurent', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U1198, Montpellier, France; University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; EPHE, Paris, France.

26645329",Behavioral Abnormality Induced by Enhanced Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenocortical Axis Activity under Dietary Zinc Deficiency and Its Usefulness as a Model.,"Dietary zinc deficiency increases glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenal cortex via enhanced hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity and induces neuropsychological symptoms, i.e., behavioral abnormality. Behavioral abnormality is due to the increase in glucocorticoid secretion rather than disturbance of brain zinc homeostasis, which occurs after the increase in glucocorticoid secretion. A major target of glucocorticoids is the hippocampus and their actions are often associated with disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission, which may be linked to behavioral abnormality, such as depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior under zinc deficiency. Glucocorticoid-mediated disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus is also involved in the pathophysiology of, not only psychiatric disorders, such as depression, but also neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. The evidence suggests that zinc-deficient animals are models for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as depression. To understand validity to apply zinc-deficient animals as a behavioral abnormality model, this paper deals with the effect of antidepressive drugs and herbal medicines on hippocampal dysfunctions and behavioral abnormality, which are induced by enhanced HPA axis activity under dietary zinc deficiency.","['behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia', 'glucocorticoid', 'glutamate excitotoxicity', 'herbal medicine', 'hippocampus', 'zinc deficiency']",International journal of molecular sciences,2016-07-22,"[{'lastname': 'Takeda', 'firstname': 'Atsushi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurophysiology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan. takedaa@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Tamano', 'firstname': 'Haruna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurophysiology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan. tamano@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Nishio', 'firstname': 'Ryusuke', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurophysiology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan. s16114@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Murakami', 'firstname': 'Taku', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurophysiology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan. s16115@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms17071149

141,27347894,Sex Hormones and Cognition: Neuroendocrine Influences on Memory and Learning.,"Sex differences in neurological disease exist in incidence, severity, progression, and symptoms and may ultimately influence treatment. Cognitive disturbances are frequent in neuropsychiatric disease with men showing greater cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, but women showing more severe dementia and cognitive decline with Alzheimer's disease. Although there are no overall differences in intelligence between the sexes, men, and women demonstrate slight but consistent differences in a number of cognitive domains. These include a male advantage, on average, in some types of spatial abilities and a female advantage on some measures of verbal fluency and memory. Sex differences in traits or behaviors generally indicate the involvement of sex hormones, such as androgens and estrogens. We review the literature on whether adult levels of testosterone and estradiol influence spatial ability in both males and females from rodent models to humans. We also include information on estrogens and their ability to modulate verbal memory in men and women. Estrone and progestins are common components of hormone therapies, and we also review the existing literature concerning their effects on cognition. We also review the sex differences in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as they relate to cognitive performance in both rodents and humans. There has been greater recognition in the scientific literature that it is important to study both sexes and also to analyze study findings with sex as a variable. Only by examining these sex differences can we progress to finding treatments that will improve the cognitive health of both men and women. © 2016 American Physiological Society.

14597658",Neuroendocrine immunomodulation network dysfunction in SAMP8 mice and PrP-hAβPPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice: potential mechanism underlying cognitive impairment.,"Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 strain (SAMP8) and PrP-hAβPPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice are classic animal models of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and familial AD respectively. Our study showed that object recognition memory, spatial learning and memory, active and passive avoidance were deteriorated and neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) network was imbalance in SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice. SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice had their own specific phenotype of cognition, neuroendocrine, immune and NIM molecular network. The endocrine hormone corticosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, chemotactic factor monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted factor and eotaxin, pro-inflammatory factor interleukin-23, and the Th1 cell acting as cell immunity accounted for cognitive deficiencies in SAMP8 mice, while adrenocorticotropic hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, colony stimulating factor granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and Th2 cell acting as humoral immunity in APP/PS1 mice. On the pathway level, chemokine signaling and T cell receptor signaling pathway played the key role in cognition impairments of two models, while cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity were more important in cognitive deterioration of SAMP8 mice than APP/PS1 mice. This mechanisms of NIM network underlying cognitive impairment is significant for further understanding the pathogenesis of AD and can provide useful information for development of AD therapeutic drug.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Gerotarget', 'PrPhAβPPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice', 'learning and memory', 'neuroendocrine immunomodulation', 'senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 strain (SAMP8)']",Oncotarget,2016-04-07,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jian-Hui', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Rui', 'initials': 'XR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Rui', 'initials': 'XR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Tong-Xing', 'initials': 'TX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Wen-Jian', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Fei', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Jun-Ping', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bo', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Chen', 'initials': 'XC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Sheng-Qi', 'initials': 'SQ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Wen-Xia', 'initials': 'WX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yong-Xiang', 'initials': 'YX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China.\nState Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing, China.'}]",,,,,10.18632/oncotarget.8453,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db7f1270>

22921511",[Location and functions of secretagogin protein].,"Secretagogin (SCGN) is a novel member of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, which was identified in islet β cells by Wagner. SCGN is a six EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, primarily expressed on the neuroendocrine axis and the central nervous system. The protein has abundant biological functions. A certain concentration of calcium ion can lead to conformation change of SCGN, resulting in the change of intracellular signal transduction. Preliminary studies showed that SCGN would be used to treat stress reaction, such as mental illness (depression), burns or post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic stress reaction caused by pain. In Alzheimer's disease, the expression of SCGN in the hippocampus can boycott neurodegeneration. In neuroendocrine tumors, SCGN presents a good consistency with neuroendocrine markers such as CgA, Syn, and NSE, with a higher overall sensitivity and specificity. In addition, SCGN is released into serum after neural damage in cerebral ischemic diseases, suggesting that SCGN can be used as a marker for brain trauma. In this article, we review the recent research progress of secretagogin, focus on its distribution and functions in various tumorous diseases and non-tumorous diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.
促泌素(secretagogin)蛋白是由奥地利学者在胰岛β细胞中鉴定出来的一个新型的EF-手型钙结合蛋白。该蛋白为六聚体左旋蛋白, 表达主要集中于神经内分泌轴和中枢神经系统。促泌素有着丰富的生物学功能。一定程度的钙离子浓度变化会导致促泌素的构象发生变化, 从而可能导致细胞内的信号转导改变。从已有的初步研究推断, 促泌素将来有可能作为一种工具来治疗应激反应, 如精神疾病(抑郁症)、烧伤或创伤后应激障碍和疼痛导致的慢性应激反应。在阿尔茨海默病中, 促泌素在海马中的表达可阻止阿尔茨海默病神经退行性病变。促泌素亦可作为疾病标志物。在神经内分泌肿瘤中, 促泌素与经典神经内分泌标志物嗜铬素A、突触素、神经元特异性烯醇化酶等有很好的一致性, 但其总体敏感性和特异性更高。此外, 脑缺血性疾病引起神经损伤后, 促泌素会释放到血清中, 这表明促泌素可作为脑损伤的标志物。本文结合促泌素蛋白在各种神经内分泌肿瘤中的分布、功能以及在非肿瘤性病变如阿尔茨海默病中的作用, 对促泌素蛋白的研究进展进行综述。",[],Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

145,26912648,Regulatory T cells delay disease progression in Alzheimer-like pathology.,"Recent studies highlight the implication of innate and adaptive immunity in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, and foster immunotherapy as a promising strategy for its treatment. Vaccines targeting amyloid-β peptide provided encouraging results in mouse models, but severe side effects attributed to T cell responses in the first clinical trial AN1792 underlined the need for better understanding adaptive immunity in Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that regulatory T cells critically control amyloid-β-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in both physiological and pathological settings. Here, we analysed the impact of regulatory T cells on spontaneous disease progression in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease. Early transient depletion of regulatory T cells accelerated the onset of cognitive deficits in APPPS1 mice, without altering amyloid-β deposition. Earlier cognitive impairment correlated with reduced recruitment of microglia towards amyloid deposits and altered disease-related gene expression profile. Conversely, amplification of regulatory T cells through peripheral low-dose IL-2 treatment increased numbers of plaque-associated microglia, and restored cognitive functions in APPPS1 mice. These data suggest that regulatory T cells play a beneficial role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, by slowing disease progression and modulating microglial response to amyloid-β deposition. Our study highlights the therapeutic potential of repurposed IL-2 for innovative immunotherapy based on modulation of regulatory T cells in Alzheimer's disease.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'immunotherapy', 'microglia', 'regulatory T cells']",Brain : a journal of neurology,2016-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Dansokho', 'firstname': 'Cira', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': '1 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Immune System, Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France guillaume.dorothee@inserm.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Ait Ahmed', 'firstname': 'Dylla', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': '1 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Immune System, Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France guillaume.dorothee@inserm.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Aid', 'firstname': 'Saba', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': '2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 3 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Neuroendocrine mechanisms of longevity and age-related diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France guillaume.dorothee@inserm.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Toly-Ndour', 'firstname': 'Cécile', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': '1 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Immune System, Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaigneau', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': '1 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Immune System, Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Calle', 'firstname': 'Vanessa', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': '1 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Immune System, Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Cagnard', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': '4 Bioinformatics Platform, Faculty of Medicine Paris Descartes, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, F-75015 Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Holzenberger', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': '2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 3 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Neuroendocrine mechanisms of longevity and age-related diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Piaggio', 'firstname': 'Eliane', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': '5 INSERM, U932, Institut Curie, Section Recherche; Center of Clinical Investigation (CIC-BT-507), F-75005, Paris, France 6 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR7211, Immunology-Immunopathology-Immunotherapy, F-75013 Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Aucouturier', 'firstname': 'Pierre', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': '1 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Immune System, Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorothée', 'firstname': 'Guillaume', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': '1 INSERM, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Laboratory Immune System, Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hôpital St-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France 2 Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS 938, CdR Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France.'}]",,,,"© The Author (2016).

146,26727032,Direct Comparison of Rat- and Human-Derived Ganglionic Eminence Tissue Grafts on Motor Function.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a debilitating, genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorder that results in early loss of medium spiny neurons from the striatum and subsequent degeneration of cortical and other subcortical brain regions. Behavioral changes manifest as a range of motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric impairments. It has been established that replacement of the degenerated medium spiny neurons with rat-derived fetal whole ganglionic eminence (rWGE) tissue can alleviate motor and cognitive deficits in preclinical rodent models of HD. However, clinical application of this cell replacement therapy requires the use of human-derived (hWGE), not rWGE, tissue. Despite this, little is currently known about the functional efficacy of hWGE. The aim of this study was to directly compare the ability of the gold standard rWGE grafts, against the clinically relevant hWGE grafts, on a range of behavioral tests of motor function. Lister hooded rats either remained as unoperated controls or received unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the lateral neostriatum. Subsets of lesioned rats then received transplants of either rWGE or hWGE primary fetal tissue into the lateral striatum. All rats were tested postlesion and postgraft on the following tests of motor function: staircase test, apomorphine-induced rotation, cylinder test, adjusting steps test, and vibrissae-evoked touch test. At 21 weeks postgraft, brain tissue was taken for histological analysis. The results revealed comparable improvements in apomorphine-induced rotational bias and the vibrissae test, despite larger graft volumes in the hWGE cohort. hWGE grafts, but not rWGE grafts, stabilized behavioral performance on the adjusting steps test. These results have implications for clinical application of cell replacement therapies, as well as providing a foundation for the development of stem cell-derived cell therapy products.",[],Cell transplantation,2016-01-05,"[{'lastname': 'Lelos', 'firstname': 'Mariah J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Brain Repair Group, School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Roberton', 'firstname': 'Victoria H', 'initials': 'VH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vinh', 'firstname': 'Ngoc-Nga', 'initials': 'NN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Harrison', 'firstname': 'Carl', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Eriksen', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Torres', 'firstname': 'Eduardo M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Clinch', 'firstname': 'Susanne P', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rosser', 'firstname': 'Anne E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dunnett', 'firstname': 'Stephen B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.3727/096368915X690297,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d930cdb0>

17073653",Chronic distress and the vulnerable host: a new target for HIV treatment and prevention?,"Pathologic stress (distress) disturbs immune, cardiovascular, metabolic, and behavioral homeostasis. Individuals living with HIV and those at risk are vulnerable to stress disorders. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is critical in neuroendocrine immune regulation. CRH, a neuropeptide, is distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and acts principally on CRH receptor type 1 (CRHR1). CRH in the brain modulates neuropsychiatric disorders. CRH and stress modulation of immunity is two-pronged; there is a direct action on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal secretion of glucocorticoids and through immune organ sympathetic innervation. CRH is a central and systemic proinflammatory cytokine. Glucocorticoids and their receptors have gene regulatory actions on viral replication and cause central and systemic immune suppression. CRH and stress activation contributes to central nervous system (CNS) viral entry important in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and HIV-associated dementia. CNS CRH overproduction short-circuits reward, executive, and emotional control, leading to addiction, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric comorbidity. CRHR1 is an important therapeutic target for medication development. CRHR1 antagonist clinical trials have focused on psychiatric disorders with little attention paid to neuroendocrine immune disorders. Studies of those with HIV and those at risk show that concurrent stress-related disorders contribute to higher morbidity and mortality; stress-related conditions, addiction, immune dysfunction, and comorbid psychiatric illness all increase HIV transmission. Neuropsychiatric disease, chronic inflammation, and substance abuse are endemic, and chronic distress is a pathologic factor. It is being understood that stress and CRH are fundamental to neuroendocrine immunity; therapeutic interventions with existing and novel agents hold promise for restoring homeostasis, reducing morbidity and mortality for those with HIV and possibly reducing future disease transmission.","['corticotropin-releasing hormone', 'cytokine', 'glucocorticoid resistance', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal', 'neuroendocrine immunology', 'stress']",Neurobehavioral HIV medicine,2016-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Contoreggi', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Intramural Research Program (IRP), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chrousos', 'firstname': 'George P', 'initials': 'GP', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Mascio', 'firstname': 'Michele Di', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'AIDS Imaging Research Section, Division of Clinical Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA.'}]",,,,,10.2147/nbhiv.s86309,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9302130>

20603485",A 24-Hour Study of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary Axes in Huntington's Disease.,"Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. Patients exhibit other symptoms including sleep and mood disturbances, muscle atrophy and weight loss which may be linked to hypothalamic pathology and dysfunction of hypothalamo-pituitary axes.
We studied neuroendocrine profiles of corticotropic, somatotropic and gonadotropic hypothalamo-pituitary axes hormones over a 24-hour period in controlled environment in 15 healthy controls, 14 premanifest and 13 stage II/III Huntington's disease subjects. We also quantified fasting levels of vasopressin, oestradiol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, thyroid stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, free total thyroxine, prolactin, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Somatotropic axis hormones, growth hormone releasing hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like factor binding protein-3 were quantified at 06:00 (fasting), 15:00 and 23:00. A battery of clinical tests, including neurological rating and function scales were performed.
24-hour concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone did not differ significantly between the Huntington's disease group and controls. Daytime growth hormone secretion was similar in control and Huntington's disease subjects. Stage II/III Huntington's disease subjects had lower concentration of post-sleep growth hormone pulse and higher insulin-like growth factor-1:growth hormone ratio which did not reach significance. In Huntington's disease subjects, baseline levels of hypothalamo-pituitary axis hormones measured did not significantly differ from those of healthy controls.
The relatively small subject group means that the study may not detect subtle perturbations in hormone concentrations. A targeted study of the somatotropic axis in larger cohorts may be warranted. However, the lack of significant results despite many variables being tested does imply that the majority of them do not differ substantially between HD and controls.",[],PloS one,2015-10-03,"[{'lastname': 'Kalliolia', 'firstname': 'Eirini', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Silajdžić', 'firstname': 'Edina', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Brain Disease Biomarker Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Wallenberg Neuroscience Centre, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Nambron', 'firstname': 'Rajasree', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Costelloe', 'firstname': 'Seán J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Biochemistry Department, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Nicholas G', 'initials': 'NG', 'affiliation': 'Biochemistry Department, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Hill', 'firstname': 'Nathan R', 'initials': 'NR', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Frost', 'firstname': 'Chris', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Watt', 'firstname': 'Hilary C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Hindmarsh', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Björkqvist', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Brain Disease Biomarker Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Wallenberg Neuroscience Centre, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Warner', 'firstname': 'Thomas T', 'initials': 'TT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom; Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.'}]",,,"24-hour concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone did not differ significantly between the Huntington's disease group and controls.

149,26388293,Involvement of Endogenous Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Activity.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to be highly involved in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation during adulthood, playing an important role in homeostasis maintenance. The present study aimed to determine the involvement of BDNF in HPA axis activity under basal and stress conditions via partial inhibition of this endogenous neurotrophin. Experiments were conducted in rats and mice with two complementary approaches: (i) BDNF knockdown with stereotaxic delivery of BDNF-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the lateral ventricle of adult male rats and (ii) genetically induced knockdown (KD) of BDNF expression specifically in the central nervous system during the first ontogenesis in mice (KD mice). Delivery of siRNA in the rat brain decreased BDNF levels in the hippocampus (-31%) and hypothalamus (-35%) but not in the amygdala, frontal cortex and pituitary. In addition, siRNA induced no change of the basal HPA axis activity. BDNF siRNA rats exhibited decreased BDNF levels and concomitant altered adrenocortoctrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone responses to restraint stress, suggesting the involvement of BDNF in the HPA axis adaptive response to stress. In KD mice, BDNF levels in the hippocampus and hypothalamus were decreased by 20% in heterozygous and by 60% in homozygous animals compared to wild-type littermates. Although, in heterozygous KD mice, no significant change was observed in the basal levels of plasma ACTH and corticosterone, both hormones were significantly increased in homozygous KD mice, demonstrating that robust cerebral BDNF inhibition (60%) is necessary to affect basal HPA axis activity. All of these results in both rats and mice demonstrate the involvement and importance of a robust endogenous pool of BDNF in basal HPA axis regulation and the pivotal function of de novo BDNF synthesis in the establishment of an adapted response to stress.","['ACTH', 'BDNF knockdown mice', 'corticosterone', 'neurotrophin', 'siRNA rat']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2015-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Naert', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm, U1198 Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Zussy', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm, U1198 Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tran Van Ba', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm, U1198 Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Chevallier', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm, U1198 Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Y-P', 'initials': 'YP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), New Orleans, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Maurice', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm, U1198 Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Givalois', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm, U1198 Montpellier, France.\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nEPHE, Paris, France.'}]",,,,© 2015 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/jne.12324,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8d16b80>

151,26289496,Effects of leisure activities at home on perceived care burden and the endocrine system of caregivers of dementia patients: a randomized controlled study.,"Psychological stress associated with caregiving is thought to underlie the high incidence of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and mortality, as well as reduced immune function, among caregivers of dementia patients. Here, we examined the effects of periodic leisure activities performed by caregivers of dementia patients with care recipients at home on perceived care burden and levels of stress hormones.
Participants were 42 caregivers aged ≥ 65 years of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. They were randomly assigned to intervention and non-intervention groups. The intervention group underwent a leisure activity program (30 min/3 times/week for 24 weeks) with the care recipient, and the control group underwent normal care activities.
The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) score, a subjective indicator of care burden, significantly decreased after intervention in the intervention group (p < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in the control group. No significant changes were observed in adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and cortisol levels in both groups.
The lack of changes in stress hormone levels despite a decrease in subjective care burden in the intervention group might be explained by the effects of the chosen leisure activity on the neuroendocrine system. Our findings suggest that periodic leisure activities can reduce perceived care burden among caregivers of dementia patients. However, in order to evaluate accurately the effects of leisure activities of the present study, long-term follow-up of both caregivers and care recipients is necessary.

25031659","You are what you eat: O-linked N-acetylglucosamine in disease, development and epigenetics.","The O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification is both responsive to nutrient availability and capable of altering intracellular cellular signalling. We summarize data defining a role for O-GlcNAcylation in metabolic homeostasis and epigenetic regulation of development in the intrauterine environment.
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes nutrient-driven O-GlcNAc addition and is subject to random X-inactivation. OGT plays key roles in growth factor signalling, stem cell biology, epigenetics and possibly imprinting. The O-GlcNAcase, which removes O-GlcNAc, is subject to tight regulation by higher order chromatin structure. O-GlcNAc cycling plays an important role in the intrauterine environment wherein OGT expression is an important biomarker of placental stress.
Regulation of O-GlcNAc cycling by X-inactivation, epigenetic regulation and nutrient-driven processes makes it an ideal candidate for a nutrient-dependent epigenetic regulator of human disease. In addition, O-GlcNAc cycling influences chromatin modifiers critical to the regulation and timing of normal development including the polycomb repression complex and the ten-eleven translocation proteins mediating DNA methyl cytosine demethylation. The pathway also impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis critical to intrauterine programming influencing disease susceptibility in later life.",[],Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2015-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Olivier-Van Stichelen', 'firstname': 'Stéphanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hanover', 'firstname': 'John A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.1097/MCO.0000000000000188

11333068",Mechanisms underlying neurocognitive dysfunctions in recurrent major depression.,"Recent work shows that depression is intimately associated with changes in cognitive functioning, including memory, attention, verbal fluency, and other aspects of higher-order cognitive processing. Changes in cognitive functioning are more likely to occur when depressive episodes are recurrent and to abate to some degree during periods of remission. However, with accumulating frequency and duration of depressive episodes, cognitive deficits can become enduring, being evident even when mood improves. Such changes in cognitive functioning give depression links to mild cognitive impairment and thereby with neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis. Depression may then be conceptualized on a dimension of depression - mild cognitive impairment - dementia. The biological underpinnings of depression have substantial overlaps with those of neurodegenerative conditions, including reduced neurogenesis, increased apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, tryptophan catabolites, autoimmunity, and immune-inflammatory processes, as well as decreased antioxidant defenses. These evolving changes over the course of depressive episodes drive the association of depression with neurodegenerative conditions. As such, the changes in cognitive functioning in depression have important consequences for the treatment of depression and in reconceptualizing the role of depression in wider neuroprogressive conditions.

17627487",The stress response neuropeptide CRF increases amyloid-β production by regulating γ-secretase activity.,"The biological underpinnings linking stress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk are poorly understood. We investigated how corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), a critical stress response mediator, influences amyloid-β (Aβ) production. In cells, CRF treatment increases Aβ production and triggers CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and γ-secretase internalization. Co-immunoprecipitation studies establish that γ-secretase associates with CRFR1; this is mediated by β-arrestin binding motifs. Additionally, CRFR1 and γ-secretase co-localize in lipid raft fractions, with increased γ-secretase accumulation upon CRF treatment. CRF treatment also increases γ-secretase activity in vitro, revealing a second, receptor-independent mechanism of action. CRF is the first endogenous neuropeptide that can be shown to directly modulate γ-secretase activity. Unexpectedly, CRFR1 antagonists also increased Aβ. These data collectively link CRF to increased Aβ through γ-secretase and provide mechanistic insight into how stress may increase AD risk. They also suggest that direct targeting of CRF might be necessary to effectively modulate this pathway for therapeutic benefit in AD, as CRFR1 antagonists increase Aβ and in some cases preferentially increase Aβ42 via complex effects on γ-secretase.","['amyloid‐β', 'corticotrophin releasing factor', 'stress', 'β‐arrestin', 'γ‐secretase']",The EMBO journal,2015-05-13,"[{'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Hyo-Jin', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ran', 'firstname': 'Yong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Joo In', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Holmes', 'firstname': 'Oliver', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Price', 'firstname': 'Ashleigh R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Smithson', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ceballos-Diaz', 'firstname': 'Carolina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Chul', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Aging and Geriatric Research, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wolfe', 'firstname': 'Michael S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': ""Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Daaka', 'firstname': 'Yehia', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryabinin', 'firstname': 'Andrey E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Seong-Hun', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hauger', 'firstname': 'Richard L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Center of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, VA Healthcare System, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Golde', 'firstname': 'Todd E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA tgolde@ufl.edu kfelsenstein0@ufl.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Felsenstein', 'firstname': 'Kevin M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA tgolde@ufl.edu kfelsenstein0@ufl.edu.'}]",,,,© 2015 The Authors.,10.15252/embj.201488795,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d901b7c0>
155,25813987,Recent advances in the role of cortisol and metabolic syndrome in age-related degenerative diseases.,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) presents an increasing prevalence in elderly people. A significant role in MetS is played by the stress response and cortisol. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity is increased by central (loss of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors) and peripheral (11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, 11β-HSD1, hyperactivity) mechanisms. The HPA hyperactivity has been found in chronic diseases affecting the endocrine (abdominal obesity with MetS, type 2 diabetes), cardiovascular (atherosclerosis, essential hypertension), and nervous systems (dementia, depression), in aging. A novel therapeutic approach (11β-HSD1 inhibition) is promising in treating the HPA axis hyperactivity in chronic diseases with MetS. A large-scale national clinical trial (AGICO, AGIng, and COrtisol study) has been proposed by our group to evaluate the role of cortisol and MetS in the main pathologies of aging (vascular and degenerative dementia, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity).","['11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1', 'Aging', 'Cortisol', 'Degenerative diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome']",Aging clinical and experimental research,2015-03-31,"[{'lastname': 'Martocchia', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, S.

156,25798813,Prenatal restraint stress decreases the expression of alpha-7 nicotinic receptor in the brain of adult rat offspring.,"Prenatal stress (PS) strongly impacts fetal brain development and function in adulthood. In normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, there is hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and loss of cholinergic neurons and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This study investigated whether prenatal restraint stress affects nAChR expression in the brain of adult offspring. For PS, pregnant dams were placed in a plastic restrainer for 45 min, three times daily during the last week of pregnancy; controls were undisturbed. Male offspring were analyzed at postnatal day (PND) 60 (n = 4 rats per group). Western blot (WB) and fluorescence microscopy showed that PS decreased α7-AChR subunit expression (∼50%) in the frontal cortex in the adult offspring. PS decreased significantly the number of α7-AChR-expressing cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (by ∼25%) and in the sensory-motor cortex (by ∼20%) without affecting the total cell number in those areas. No alterations were found in the hippocampus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), or WB analysis, but a detailed fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that PS affected α7-AChR mainly in the CA3 and dentate gyrus subfields: PS decreased α7-AChR subunit expression by ∼25 and ∼30%, respectively. Importantly, PS decreased the number of α7-AChR-expressing cells and the total cell number (by ∼15 and 20%, respectively) in the dentate gyrus. PS differently affected α4-AChR: PS impaired its mRNA expression in the frontal cortex (by ∼50%), without affecting protein levels. These results demonstrate that disturbances during gestation produce long-term alterations in the expression pattern of α7-AChR in rat brain.","['Aging', 'cholinergic', 'cortex', 'gestational stress', 'hippocampus', 'neurodegeneration']","Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2015-03-24,"[{'lastname': 'Baier', 'firstname': 'Carlos J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'a Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de Bahía Blanca (INIBIBB), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) - Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS) , Bahía Blanca , Argentina .'}, {'lastname': 'Pallarés', 'firstname': 'María E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'b Instituto de Biología Celular y Neurociencias ""Prof. E.

157,25642989,Ginkgo biloba Extract 761: A Review of Basic Studies and Potential Clinical Use in Psychiatric Disorders.,"Ginkgo biloba extract 761 (EGb 761) is a well-defined extract obtained from Ginkgo biloba leaves according to a standardized method. It has been used extensively for the treatment of diseases related to the central nervous system including neurosensory disturbances, cerebrovascular insufficiency, peripheral vascular disturbances, and degenerative dementia. The potential use of EGb 761 has also been suggested for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, which is discussed in the current review. These disorders constitute a global epidemic with serious economic and social consequences. Current available treatments with synthetic drugs may have some disadvantages and undesired side effects. There are diverse natural extracts that have been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders due to their therapeutic action and low rate of side effects, such as EGb 761. EGb 761 has the ability to produce neuroprotection due to its chemical composition and the synergy of its components. We describe several neuroprotective mechanisms of action of EGb 761 such as antioxidant effects, modulation of neurotransmission, neuroendocrine regulation, and upregulation of neurotrophic factors, which underlie its potential therapeutic effect on psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic effects of EGb 761 both in animal models of psychiatric disorders and in clinical studies that include these pathologies. We focus on depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, as well as the therapeutic action of EGb 761 on dementia in comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. In the current review, we propose thef potential use of EGb 761, alone or combined with current medication treatment, for psychiatric disorders.",[],CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2015-02-03,"[{'lastname': 'Montes', 'firstname': 'Pedro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ruiz-Sanchez', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rojas', 'firstname': 'Carolina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rojas', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neurotoxicology, Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía.

158,25565388,Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning in Huntington's disease and its association with depressive symptoms and suicidality.,"Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been reported in Huntington's disease (HD). In non-HD populations, alterations in HPA axis activity have been associated with depression and suicidality. The present study aims to compare HPA axis activity between HD mutation carriers and controls, and examine its association with depressive symptoms and suicidality. To this end, salivary cortisol concentrations at seven time points, as well as depressive symptoms and suicidality, were assessed in 49 pre-motor, 102 motor symptomatic mutation carriers and 55 controls, at baseline and follow-up combined. Differences in parameters of HPA axis activity between these three groups, and their associations with depressive symptoms and suicidality in HD mutation carriers, were analysed using multilevel regression analyses. There were no differences in parameters of HPA axis activity between mutation carriers and controls, whereas pre-motor symptomatic mutation carriers had a significantly higher area under the curve to the increase (AUCi ) compared to motor symptomatic mutation carriers. In the entire HD cohort, HPA axis activity was not associated with depressive symptoms or suicidality. After stratifying mutation carriers into pre-motor, early and advanced disease stages, β values differed between these groups. Remarkably, a higher AUCi was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in pre-motor and early disease stage mutation carriers, with a reverse nonsignificant association in advanced disease stage mutation carriers. The lower AUCi in motor symptomatic mutation carriers and the varying associations with depressive symptoms and suicidality in pre-motor, early and advanced disease stages could possibly be explained by exhaustion of the HPA axis after prolonged stress-induced HPA axis hyperactivity and deserves further longitudinal study.","['cohort study', 'depression', 'glucocorticoids', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'suicide']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2015-01-08,"[{'lastname': 'Hubers', 'firstname': 'A A M', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Mast', 'firstname': 'R C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roos', 'firstname': 'R A C', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Veen', 'firstname': 'L J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cobbaert', 'firstname': 'C M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'van Duijn', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Giltay', 'firstname': 'E J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2015 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/jne.12255,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcbc89f0>

To determine the role of melatonin in the pathogenesis of AD, suitable animal models are needed. The OXYS rats are an experimental model of accelerated senescence that has also been proposed as a spontaneous rat model of AD-like pathology. In the present study, we demonstrate that disturbances in melatonin secretion occur in OXYS rats at 4 months of age. These disturbances occur simultaneously with manifestation of behavioral abnormalities against the background of neurodegeneration and alterations in hormonal status but before the signs of amyloid-β accumulation. We examined whether oral administration of melatonin could normalize the melatonin secretion and have beneficial effects on OXYS rats before progression to AD-like pathology. The results showed that melatonin treatment restored melatonin secretion in the pineal gland of OXYS rats as well as the serum levels of growth hormone and IGF-1, the level of BDNF in the hippocampus and the healthy state of hippocampal neurons. Additionally, melatonin treatment of OXYS rats prevented an increase in anxiety and the decline of locomotor activity, of exploratory activity, and of reference memory. Thus, melatonin may be involved in AD progression, whereas oral administration of melatonin could be a prophylactic strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of some features of AD pathology.",[],Biogerontology,2014-12-18,"[{'lastname': 'Rudnitskaya', 'firstname': 'Ekaterina A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Prospekt Lavrentyeva 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Maksimova', 'firstname': 'Kseniya Yi', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Muraleva', 'firstname': 'Natalia A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Logvinov', 'firstname': 'Sergey V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yanshole', 'firstname': 'Lyudmila V', 'initials': 'LV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kolosova', 'firstname': 'Nataliya G', 'initials': 'NG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stefanova', 'firstname': 'Natalia A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s10522-014-9547-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcbd6b80>
160,25462902,Lower morning to evening cortisol ratio is associated with cognitive impairment in men but not women: An analysis of 733 older subjects of the cross-sectional KORA-Age study.,"A dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment. Surprisingly, little agreement exists on the association of cortisol and cognitive impairment. Thus, we sought to examine the association between cognitive function and salivary cortisol levels in a representative sample of older men and women.
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 733 study participants (65-90 years old, mean age=74.9) of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg)-Age study. Associations were examined between cognitive function (determined by telephone interview for cognitive status-modified, TICS-m) and salivary cortisol measured upon waking (M1), 30min after awakening (M2), and in the late evening (E).
In a dose response manner, lower morning (M1 and M2), and increased evening levels were observed in participants with probable dementia (4.5%, N=33) and slightly increased in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (13.8%, N=101) compared to healthy individuals. Higher morning to evening ratios were associated with reduced odds of cognitive impairment, even after adjustments for important confounders (M1/E ratio: OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.08-2.07, M2/E ratio: 1.41, 1.01-1.95, per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase). However, the significant association of an increased risk for cognitive impairment was observed among men (M1/E: OR=1.94, 95% CI=1.24-3.02; M2/E=1.74, 1.12-2.71) but not women (M1/E: OR=1.11, 0.69-1.78; M2/E=1.09, 0.67-1.77).

However, brain exposure to high cortisol concentrations may also accelerate disease progression and cognitive decline. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether HPA-axis dysregulation occurs at early clinical stages of AD and whether plasma and CSF cortisol levels are associated with clinical disease progression. Morning plasma and CSF cortisol concentrations were obtained from the subjects with AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment of AD type (MCI-AD), MCI of other type (MCI-O), and controls with normal cognition included in a multicenter study from the German Dementia Competence Network. A clinical and neuropsychological follow-up was performed in a subgroup of participants with MCI-AD, MCI-O, and AD dementia. CSF cortisol concentrations were increased in the subjects with AD dementia or MCI-AD compared with subjects with MCI-O or normal cognition.

162,25434514,[Frailty syndrome: an old new friend].,"Frailty syndrome is defined as extreme stress vulnerability and decreased potential to adapt. The elderly and chronically ill patients are affected mostly. This condition increases the risk of adverse health outcomes as infections, falls, delirium, institutionalization, progression of comorbidities and mortality. The pathophysiological mechanism is a complex immune and neuroendocrine dysregulation. According to the phenotype model, frailty presents when three of the followings occur: weakness, exhaustion, slowness, weight loss and decreased activity, while cumulative model counts the number of health deficits. Aging, frailty, dementia and depression are independent clinical entities; they may present separately but may also potentiate each other. Hence most of the frailty scales assess the physical, mental and social dimensions as well. Mild or moderate frailty is potentially reversible with an individualised caring plan. Given short, easy-to-use screening tools, risk groups can be identified in the primary care and referred to a specialised team for further treatment. Here the authors summarise the literature of a re-discovered, current clinical phenomena, frailty syndrome, focusing on the practical issues in primary care.

163,25290346,Leptin: A hormone linking activation of neuroendocrine axes with neuropathology.,"Leptin, a peptide hormone secreted by adipocytes, plays a central role in controlling appetite and weight in both rodents and humans. Basic science and clinical research suggest that this hormone not only affects the regulation of the neuroendocrine axes, but also exerts effects on the central nervous system with subsequent alterations in psychological functions. For instance, leptin suppresses cortisol secretion during stress-related activation of the adrenal axis. As psychiatric disorders like depression are associated with hypercortisolism, leptin is proposed to exert anti-depressant-like effects due to its inhibition of chronically overactive hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Moreover, leptin status of depressed patients could serve as a prognostic marker for therapy response. Besides its influence on neuroendocrine pathways leptin seems to have direct central effects on brain development and neuroplasticity. Low leptin levels have been shown to be associated with increased risk of developing dementia, supporting the idea of a pro-cognitive effect of leptin. These areas may have direct clinical implications and deserve to be studied further in the future.","['Leptin', 'Neuroendocrine axes', 'Neuropsychiatric aspects']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2014-10-08,"[{'lastname': 'Stieg', 'firstname': 'Mareike R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institute of Psychiatry, Kreapelinstr. 2-10, 80804 Munich, Germany.

Healthy male Wistar Rats were selected. The AD model was generated by orthotopic injection of beta-amyloid 25-35 (Abeta25-35) into the right lateral ventricle. The animals were divided into five study groups: Catalpol at low dose (5 mg/kg), Catalpol at high dose (10 mg/kg), model control group and sham surgery control group, n = 9 respectively. The serum concentration of hydrocortisone (HYD), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Structural alterations of the hypothalamus were examined by H&E stain and electron microscope. The CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) positive neurons were detected with immunohistochemistry.
Serum HYD level was significantly increased (p < 0.01), and both ACTH and CRH were dramatically decreased (p < 0.01) in the AD model group rats compared with normal control rats at day 7. Catalpol treatment was able to improve the hormone secretion disorder in AD model group rats compared with the model group (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) in particular at 21 days.

16571604",Effects of deletion of mutant huntingtin in steroidogenic factor 1 neurons on the psychiatric and metabolic phenotype in the BACHD mouse model of Huntington disease.,"Psychiatric and metabolic features appear several years before motor disturbances in the neurodegenerative Huntington's disease (HD), caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although the mechanisms leading to these aspects are unknown, dysfunction in the hypothalamus, a brain region controlling emotion and metabolism, has been suggested. A direct link between the expression of the disease causing protein, huntingtin (HTT), in the hypothalamus and the development of metabolic and psychiatric-like features have been shown in the BACHD mouse model of HD. However, precisely which circuitry in the hypothalamus is critical for these features is not known. We hypothesized that expression of mutant HTT in the ventromedial hypothalamus, an area involved in the regulation of metabolism and emotion would be important for the development of these non-motor aspects. Therefore, we inactivated mutant HTT in a specific neuronal population of the ventromedial hypothalamus expressing the transcription factor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) in the BACHD mouse using cross-breeding based on a Cre-loxP system. Effects on anxiety-like behavior were assessed using the elevated plus maze and novelty-induced suppressed feeding test. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using the Porsolt forced swim test. Effects on the metabolic phenotype were analyzed using measurements of body weight and body fat, as well as serum insulin and leptin levels. Interestingly, the inactivation of mutant HTT in SF1-expressing neurons exerted a partial positive effect on the depressive-like behavior in female BACHD mice at 4 months of age. In this cohort of mice, no anxiety-like behavior was detected. The deletion of mutant HTT in SF1 neurons did not have any effect on the development of metabolic features in BACHD mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mutant HTT regulates metabolic networks by affecting hypothalamic circuitries that do not involve the SF1 neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus.",[],PloS one,2014-10-02,"[{'lastname': 'Baldo', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheong', 'firstname': 'Rachel Y', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Åsa', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.'}]",,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0107691,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe9c860>
166,25246229,The influence of the HPG axis on stress response and depressive-like behaviour in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG tandem repeat mutation encoding a polyglutamine tract expansion in the huntingtin protein. Depression is among the most common affective symptoms in HD but the pathophysiology is unclear. We have previously discovered sexually dimorphic depressive-like behaviours in the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD at a pre-motor symptomatic age. Interestingly, only female R6/1 mice display this phenotype. Sexual dimorphism has not been explored in the human HD population despite the well-established knowledge that the clinical depression rate in females is almost twice that of males. Female susceptibility suggests a role of sex hormones, which have been shown to modulate stress response. There is evidence suggesting that the gonads are adversely affected in HD patients, which could alter sex hormone levels. The present study examined the role sex hormones play on stress response in the R6/1 mouse model of HD, in particular, its modulatory effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and depression-like behaviour. We found that the gonads of female R6/1 mice show atrophy at an early age. Expression levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) were decreased in the hypothalamus of female HD mice, relative to wild-type female littermates, as were serum testosterone levels. Female serum estradiol levels were not significantly changed. Gonadectomy surgery reduced HPA-axis activity in female mice but had no effect on behavioural phenotypes. Furthermore, expression of the oestrogen receptor (ER) α gene was found to be higher in the adrenal cells of female HD mice. Finally, administration of an ERβ agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) rescued depressive-like behaviour in the female HD mice. Our findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of sexually dimorphic neuroendocrine, physiological and behavioural endophenotypes in HD, and suggest a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.","['Adrenal gland', 'Affective symptoms', 'Corticosterone', 'Depression', 'HPA axis', 'HPG axis', ""Huntington's disease"", 'Psychiatric disorder', 'Sex hormones', 'Stress']",Experimental neurology,2014-09-24,"[{'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'X', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Neural Plasticity Laboratory, Behavioural Neuroscience Division, The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia; Dept of Anatomy & Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.

167,25152298,Antidepressant-like effect of Butea superba in mice exposed to chronic mild stress and its possible mechanism of action.,"Butea superba (BS) is a Thai medicinal plant that has been used as a folk medicine to improve physical and mental conditions and to prevent impaired sexual performance in middle-aged or elderly males. We have previously reported that this plant extract could improve cognitive deficits and depression-like behavior in olfactory bulbectomized mice, an animal model of dementia and depression.
In this study we examined the effect of BS on depression-like behavior in mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to clarify the antidepressant-like activity of BS and the molecular mechanism underlying this effect.
UCMS mice were administered BS daily (300 mg of dried herb weight/kg, p.o.) or a reference drug, imipramine (IMP, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), 1 week after starting the UCMS procedure. We employed the sucrose preference test and the tail suspension test to analyze anhedonia and depression-like behavior of mice, respectively. Serum and brain tissues of mice were used for neurochemical and immunohistochemical studies. The UCMS procedure induced anhedonia and depression-like behavior, and BS treatment, as well as IMP treatment, attenuated these symptoms. UCMS caused an elevation of serum corticosterone level, an index of hyper-activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in a manner attenuated by BS and IMP treatment. BS treatment also attenuated UCMS-induced decrease in the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and a phosphorylated form of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR1, synaptic plasticity-related signaling proteins. Moreover, the UCMS procedure reduced doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. BS administration reversed these UCMS-induced neurochemical and histological abnormalities.
These results suggest that BS can ameliorate chronic stress-induced depression-like symptoms and that the effects of BS are mediated by restoring dysfunctions of the HPA axis and synaptic plasticity-related signaling systems and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.","['Butea superba', 'Depression-like symptoms', 'Neurogenesis', 'Synaptic plasticity-related signaling', 'Unpredictable chronic mild stress']",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2014-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Mizuki', 'firstname': 'Daishu', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama-shi, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsumoto', 'firstname': 'Kinzo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama-shi, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.

169,24951540,Ubiquitin-specific protease-14 reduces cellular aggregates and protects against mutant huntingtin-induced cell degeneration: involvement of the proteasome and ER stress-activated kinase IRE1α.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal inherited neurological disease caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the first exon of huntingtin gene encoding for the huntingtin protein (Htt). In HD, there is an accumulation of intracellular aggregates of mutant Htt that negatively influence cellular functions. The aggregates contain ubiquitin, and part of the HD pathophysiology could result from an imbalance in cellular ubiquitin levels. Deubiquitinating enzymes are important for replenishing the ubiquitin pool, but less is known about their roles in brain diseases. We show here that overexpression of the ubiquitin-specific protease-14 (Usp14) reduces cellular aggregates in mutant Htt-expressing cells mainly via the ubiquitin proteasome system. We also observed that the serine-threonine kinase IRE1 involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses is activated in mutant Htt-expressing cells in culture as well as in the striatum of mutant Htt transgenic (BACHD) mice. Usp14 interacted with IRE1 in control cells but less in mutant Htt-expressing cells. Overexpression of Usp14 in turn was able to inhibit phosphorylation of IRE1α in mutant Htt-overexpressing cells and to protect against cell degeneration and caspase-3 activation. These results show that ER stress-mediated IRE1 activation is part of mutant Htt toxicity and that this is counteracted by Usp14 expression. Usp14 effectively reduced cellular aggregates and counteracted cell degeneration indicating an important role of this protein in mutant Htt-induced cell toxicity.",[],Human molecular genetics,2014-06-22,"[{'lastname': 'Hyrskyluoto', 'firstname': 'Alise', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedicine/Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki FIN-00290, Finland, Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bruelle', 'firstname': 'Céline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedicine/Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki FIN-00290, Finland, Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lundh', 'firstname': 'Sofia H', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Lund University, Lund SE-221 84, Sweden and.'}, {'lastname': 'Do', 'firstname': 'Hai Thi', 'initials': 'HT', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedicine/Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki FIN-00290, Finland, Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kivinen', 'firstname': 'Jenny', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedicine/Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki FIN-00290, Finland, Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rappou', 'firstname': 'Elisabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedicine/Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki FIN-00290, Finland, Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Reijonen', 'firstname': 'Sami', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Waltimo', 'firstname': 'Tuure', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Åsa', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Lund University, Lund SE-221 84, Sweden and.'}, {'lastname': 'Lindholm', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedicine/Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki FIN-00290, Finland, Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland, dan.lindholm@helsinki.fi.'}, {'lastname': 'Korhonen', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedicine/Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki FIN-00290, Finland, Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research, Helsinki, Finland, Division of Child Psychiatry, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.'}]",,,,"© The Author 2014.

170,24886966,Differential effects of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on systemic immune cells after severe experimental stroke.,"Infectious complications are the leading cause of death in the post-acute phase of stroke. Post-stroke immunodeficiency is believed to result from neurohormonal dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the differential effects of these neuroendocrine systems on the peripheral immune cells are only partially understood. Here, we determined the impact of the hormones of the SNS and HPA on distinct immune cell populations and characterized their interactions after stroke. At various time points after cortical or extensive hemispheric cerebral ischemia, plasma cortisone, corticosterone, metanephrine and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were measured in mice. Leukocyte subpopulations were flow cytometrically analyzed in spleen and blood. To investigate their differential sensitivity to stress hormones, splenocytes were incubated in vitro with prednisolone, epinephrine and their respective receptor blockers. Glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) and beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) on leukocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry. In vivo effects of GCR and selective β2-AR blockade, respectively, were defined on serum hormone concentrations, lymphopenia and interferon-γ production after severe ischemia. We found elevated cortisone, corticosterone and metanephrine levels and associated lymphocytopenia only after extensive brain infarction. Prednisolone resulted in a 5 times higher cell death rate of splenocytes than epinephrine in vitro. Prednisolone and epinephrine-induced leukocyte cell death was prevented by GCR and β2-AR blockade, respectively. In vivo, only GCR blockade prevented post ischemic lymphopenia whereas β2-AR preserved interferon-γ secretion by lymphocytes. GCR blockade increased metanephrine levels in vivo and prednisolone, in turn, decreased β2-AR expression on lymphocytes. In conclusion, mediators of the SNS and the HPA axis differentially affect the systemic immune system after stroke. Moreover, our findings suggest a negative-feedback of corticosteroids on the sympathetic axis which may control the post-stroke stress-reaction. This complex interplay between the HPA and the SNS after stroke has to be considered when targeting the neurohormonal systems in the post acute phase of severe stroke.","['Catecholamines', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Lymphocytes', 'Stroke-induced immunosuppression']","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2014-06-03,"[{'lastname': 'Mracsko', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 400, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Liesz', 'firstname': 'Arthur', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 400, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, University Hospital Munich, Max-Lebsche-Platz 30, 81377 Munich, Germany; Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy), Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Karcher', 'firstname': 'Simone', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 400, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zorn', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, University Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 400, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bari', 'firstname': 'Ferenc', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Physics and Informatics, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Veltkamp', 'firstname': 'Roland', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 400, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College, London, UK.

20827273",Animal models for depression associated with HIV-1 infection.,"Antiretroviral therapy has greatly extended the lifespan of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV). As a result, the long-term effects of HIV infection, in particular those originating in the central nervous system (CNS), such as HIV associated depression, have gained importance. Animal models for HIV infection have proved very useful for understanding the disease and developing treatment strategies. However, HIV associated depression remains poorly understood and so far there is neither a fully satisfactory animal model, nor a pathophysiologically guided treatment for this condition.

22071871",Neuropathology of stress.,"Environmental challenges are part of daily life for any individual. In fact, stress appears to be increasingly present in our modern, and demanding, industrialized society. Virtually every aspect of our body and brain can be influenced by stress and although its effects are partly mediated by powerful corticosteroid hormones that target the nervous system, relatively little is known about when, and how, the effects of stress shift from being beneficial and protective to becoming deleterious. Decades of stress research have provided valuable insights into whether stress can directly induce dysfunction and/or pathological alterations, which elements of stress exposure are responsible, and which structural substrates are involved. Using a broad definition of pathology, we here review the ""neuropathology of stress"" and focus on structural consequences of stress exposure for different regions of the rodent, primate and human brain. We discuss cytoarchitectural, neuropathological and structural plasticity measures as well as more recent neuroimaging techniques that allow direct monitoring of the spatiotemporal effects of stress and the role of different CNS structures in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in human brain. We focus on the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, key brain regions that not only modulate emotions and cognition but also the response to stress itself, and discuss disorders like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, Cushing syndrome and dementia.",[],Acta neuropathologica,2013-12-10,"[{'lastname': 'Lucassen', 'firstname': 'Paul J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'SILS-Center for Neuroscience, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 1098 XH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, p.j.lucassen@uva.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'Pruessner', 'firstname': 'Jens', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sousa', 'firstname': 'Nuno', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Almeida', 'firstname': 'Osborne F X', 'initials': 'OF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Van Dam', 'firstname': 'Anne Marie', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rajkowska', 'firstname': 'Grazyna', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'Dick F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Czéh', 'firstname': 'Boldizsár', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s00401-013-1223-5,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9a4af40>

8755481",Secretagogue stimulation of neurosecretory cells elicits filopodial extensions uncovering new functional release sites.,"Regulated exocytosis in neurosecretory cells relies on the timely fusion of secretory granules (SGs) with the plasma membrane. Secretagogue stimulation leads to an enlargement of the cell footprint (surface area in contact with the coverslip), an effect previously attributed to exocytic fusion of SGs with the plasma membrane. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we reveal the formation of filopodia-like structures in bovine chromaffin and PC12 cells driving the footprint expansion, suggesting the involvement of cortical actin network remodeling in this process. Using exocytosis-incompetent PC12 cells, we demonstrate that footprint enlargement is largely independent of SG fusion, suggesting that vesicular exocytic fusion plays a relatively minor role in filopodial expansion. The footprint periphery, including filopodia, undergoes extensive F-actin remodeling, an effect abolished by the actomyosin inhibitors cytochalasin D and blebbistatin. Imaging of both Lifeact-GFP and the SG marker protein neuropeptide Y-mCherry reveals that SGs actively translocate along newly forming actin tracks before undergoing fusion. Together, these data demonstrate that neurosecretory cells regulate the number of SGs undergoing exocytosis during sustained stimulation by controlling vesicular mobilization and translocation to the plasma membrane through actin remodeling. Such remodeling facilitates the de novo formation of fusion sites.",[],The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2013-12-07,"[{'lastname': 'Papadopulos', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research, Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Sally', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tomatis', 'firstname': 'Vanesa M', 'initials': 'VM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gormal', 'firstname': 'Rachel S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Meunier', 'firstname': 'Frederic A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2634-13.2013

11113178",Clustering of transcriptional profiles identifies changes to insulin signaling as an early event in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease affects more than 35 million people worldwide but there is no known cure. Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease but it is not clear how age-related changes impact the disease. Here, we used a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to identify age-specific changes that occur prior to and at the onset of traditional Alzheimer-related phenotypes including amyloid plaque formation. To identify these early events we used transcriptional profiling of mouse brains combined with computational approaches including singular value decomposition and hierarchical clustering.
Our study identifies three key events in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. First, the most important drivers of Alzheimer's disease onset in these mice are age-specific changes. These include perturbations of the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Second, the earliest detectable disease-specific changes occur to genes commonly associated with the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary (HPA) axis. These include the down-regulation of genes relating to metabolism, depression and appetite. Finally, insulin signaling, in particular the down-regulation of the insulin receptor substrate 4 (Irs4) gene, may be an important event in the transition from age-related changes to Alzheimer's disease specific-changes.

176,24114007,Stress and hemostasis: an update.,"Numerous naturalistic, experimental, and mechanistic studies strongly support the notion that-as part of fight-or-flight response-hemostatic responses to acute psychosocial stress result in net hypercoagulability, which would protect a healthy organism from bleeding in case of injury. Sociodemographic factors, mental states, and comorbidities are important modulators of the acute prothrombotic stress response. In patients with atherosclerosis, exaggerated and prolonged stress-hypercoagulability might accelerate coronary thrombus growth following plaque rupture. Against a background risk from acquired prothrombotic conditions and inherited thrombophilia, acute stress also might trigger venous thromboembolic events. Chronic stressors such as job strain, dementia caregiving, and posttraumatic stress disorder as well as psychological distress from depressive and anxiety symptoms elicit a chronic low-grade hypercoagulable state that is no longer viewed as physiological but might impair vascular health. Through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, higher order cognitive processes and corticolimbic brain areas shape the acute prothrombotic stress response. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic dysfunction, including vagal withdrawal, are important regulators of hemostatic activity with longer lasting stress. Randomized placebo-controlled trials suggest that several cardiovascular drugs attenuate the acute prothrombotic stress response. Behavioral interventions and psychotropic medications might mitigate chronic low-grade hypercoagulability in stressed individuals, but further studies are clearly needed. Restoring normal hemostatic function with biobehavioral interventions bears the potential to ultimately decrease the risk of thrombotic diseases.",[],Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2013-10-12,"[{'lastname': 'Austin', 'firstname': 'Anthony W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': 'Montreal Behavioural Medicine Centre, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Wissmann', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'von Kanel', 'firstname': 'Roland', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.",10.1055/s-0033-1357487,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db596db0>

19664365",Rapidly progressive dementia due to neurosarcoidosis.,"Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is typically defined as a cognitive decline progressing to severe impairment in less than 1-2 years, typically within weeks or months. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is important because many conditions causing RPD are treatable. Neurosarcoidosis is often cited as an unusual reversible cause of RPD.
We report two cases of neurosarcoidosis presenting as RPD.
Case 1: A 61-year-old woman developed a RPD associated with visual loss. In seven months she was dependent for self-care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed temporal and suprasellar brain lesions. Treatment with high-dose intravenous prednisolone was associated with partial improvement. Case 2: A 43-year-old woman who was being treated for diabetes insipidus developed a severe episodic amnesia one year after onset of cognitive symptoms. Previous MRI had shown a hypothalamic lesion and she had been treated with oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide. There was reduction of the MRI findings but no improvement in the cognitive deficits. Brain biopsy disclosed noncaseous granulomas and granulomatous angiitis; treatment was changed to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, with poor symptomatic response.
The diagnosis of RPD due to neurosarcoidosis can be challenging when the disease is restricted to the nervous system. In these cases, clinical presentation of RPD associated with neuroendocrine and visual dysfunction, imaging findings showing hypothalamic lesions and, in some cases, brain biopsy, are the key to a correct diagnosis. It is possible that earlier diagnoses and treatment could have led to a better outcome in these patients.
Demência rapidamente progressiva (DRP) é tipicamente definida como um declínio cognitivo que progride para prejuízo funcional severo em menos de 1-2 anos, geralmente em semanas a meses. O diagnóstico rápido e acurado é fundamental, já que muitas condições que levam a DRP são reversíveis.
Relatamos dois casos de neurosarcoidose que se apresentaram como DRP.
Caso 1: Uma mulher de 61 anos desenvolveu uma DRP associada a perda de acuidade visual. Em sete meses evoluiu com dependência para auto-cuidado. A ressonância magnética (RM) revelou lesões encefálicas temporais e supraselares. Evoluiu com melhora parcial após tratamento com metilprednisolona intravenosa em altas doses. Caso 2: Uma mulher de 43 anos que estava em tratamento para diabetes insipidus desenvolveu uma amnésia episódica severa um ano após o início dos sintomas cognitivos. A RM anterior mostrava uma lesão hipotalâmica, e ela recebeu tratamento oral com prednisona e ciclofosfamida. Houve redução dos achados da RM, porem sem melhora dos déficits cognitivos.

178,24074804,Cortisol and depression in pre-diagnosed and early stage Huntington's disease.,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction and depression have both been shown to occur in Huntington's disease (HD) gene carriers prior to diagnosis (pre-HD) and in diagnosed HD patients. However, the relationship between HPA axis dysfunction and the severity of depressive symptomatology in pre-HD and early-HD has not been systematically examined, despite morning hypercortisolism being a characteristic feature of some subtypes of idiopathic depression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HPA axis function is related to levels of depression in pre-HD and early-HD. To assess HPA axis function we obtained salivary cortisol concentrations from 20 controls, 20 pre-HD, and 17 early-HD participants at four time points over a 24h period. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Report. Of the participants who were found not to be depressed, the early-HD group had significantly lower morning cortisol levels relative to pre-HD and controls. In contrast, the early-HD group with at least mild or greater levels of depression symptoms had a comparable cortisol concentration to pre-HD and controls. The results suggest that early-HD may be associated with hypocortisolism. However when depressed, a hyperactive HPA axis response may still be induced in early-HD and lead to cortisol levels that are similar to pre-HD and controls. Our study reveals that cortisol levels in HD may be modified by the presence or absence of depressive symptomatology. Depression may be an important factor for understanding how the HPA axis is affected in HD, particularly in the morning.","['Cortisol', 'Depression', ""Huntington's disease"", 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'Saliva', 'Stress']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2013-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Shirbin', 'firstname': 'Christopher A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology and Psychiatry, Monash University, Clayton Campus, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chua', 'firstname': 'Phyllis', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Churchyard', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lowndes', 'firstname': 'Georgia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hannan', 'firstname': 'Anthony J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pang', 'firstname': 'Terence Y', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chiu', 'firstname': 'Edmond', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stout', 'firstname': 'Julie C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

179,23931276,Circulating aminopeptidase activities in men and women with essential hypertension.,"Essential hypertension is one of the major contributors to premature morbidity and mortality due to the incresased risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, renal disease, peripheral vascular disease and vascular dementia for both men and women. However, its basic causes remain unknown. In the present work we studied the activity of several proteolytic regulatory enzymes related to renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) (aminopeptidase A, APA; aminopeptidase N, APN; aminopeptidase B, APB; and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, IRAP); with oxytocin regulation (oxytocinase); with the metabolism of GnRH and TRH (pyrrolidone carboxypeptidase, Pcp); and with enkephalins metabolism (enkephalindegrading activity, EDA), to elucidate their role in the mechanisms responsible of essential hypertension and to discuss the possible gender differences. Serum samples of 53 individuals with essential hypertension and 60 healthy volunteers were collected and used to assay enzyme activities, gonad hormones testosterone and estradiol, TSH and free thyroxin (fT4). Differences were observed in APA, APN, Pcp and EDA specific activities, and in serum gonad hormone levels between hypertensive and control groups. Only Pcp activity showed gender differences. Regarding the RAS, APA is reduced while APN is increased, suggesting increased levels of angiotensin II and a facilitation of the conversion of angiotensin III in angiotensin IV. Thus, the changes in several RAS-regulating specific activities and other enzyme activities involved in the neuroendocrine modulation of gonad and stress-related functions are related to essential hypertension with minor gender differences. Therefore, aminopeptidases constitute new elements for the knowledge of the causes of essential hypertension and an alternative as therapeutic targets against the illness.",[],Current medicinal chemistry,2013-08-13,"[{'lastname': 'Sánchez-Agesta Ortega', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Experimental Sciences, Department of Health Sciences, University of Jaén, Campus Universitario Las Lagunillas, E-23071, Jaén, Spain. mramirez@ujaen.es.'}, {'lastname': 'Arias de Saavedra-Alías', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liébana-Cañada', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sánchez-Muñoz', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Martos', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ramírez-Expósito', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.2174/15672050113109990205,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db586950>
180,23906001,Hypercortisolemia and glucocorticoid receptor-signaling insufficiency in Alzheimer's disease initiation and development.,"The cause and mechanism of development of Alzheimer' s disease (AD) remain unexplained. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, denoted by adrenal cortisol hypersecretion, is a recognised feature of the condition but generally disregarded as causative, due to lack of association between AD and other hypercortisolemic states. However, a meta-analysis of published studies suggests a need for reappraisal. A specific circadian rhythm of cortisol hypersecretion pertains at mild-to-moderate AD stages, entailing increased levels at the circadian peak from a low nadir. This is in contrast to the continuously elevated levels that are characteristic of other hypercortisolemic states, e.g. Cushing' s disease or major depression. This previously overlooked detail provides a starting premise here: that equating the form of hypercortisolism in AD with that in other states is inappropriate, as phasic and chronic elevation elicit different neuroendocrine effects. Theoretical implications are discussed in this review. Given the capacity of glucocorticoids and corticotropin-releasing hormone to induce AD-associated pathologies, I suggest a role for circadian cortisol hypersecretion in the initiation of sporadic AD; and propose a temporal mechanism for AD development featuring neuroinflammation- mediated suppression of central glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. This latter may represent a critical phase in AD development, where the density of functional GR is proposed to underlie the ""cognitive reserve"". Supporting evidence for this mechanism is drawn from the brain regional locations of AD neuropathologies, and from risk factors for AD development (aging, ApoE-4 genotype, and hypertension). Thus, it is argued that basal hypercortisolemia merits further scrutiny regarding AD causation and development.",[],Current Alzheimer research,2013-08-03,"[{'lastname': 'Notarianni', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Durham University, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK. elenanot@f2s.com'}]",,,,,10.2174/15672050113109990137,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db59b9f0>
181,23864592,The stress response to surgery and postoperative delirium: evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperresponsiveness and decreased suppression of the GH/IGF-1 Axis.,"The aim of this study is to determine whether postoperative delirium is associated with dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 (GH/IGF-1) responses following acute systemic inflammation.
Plasma levels of cortisol, IGF-1, C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were measured before and after surgery in 101 patients ≥ 60 years without dementia undergoing elective hip arthroplasty. Participants were assessed with confusion assessment method and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision; DSM-IV-TR) postoperatively and 37 patients fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria for delirium.
Preoperative plasma cortisol levels were similar in delirium and nondelirium groups (405.37 ± 189.04 vs 461.83 ± 219.39; P = .22). Participants with delirium had higher postoperative cortisol levels (821.67 ± 367.17 vs 599.58 ± 214.94; P = .002) with enhanced postoperative elevation in relation to baseline (1.9- vs 1.5-fold; P = .004). The plasma levels of IGF1 did not differ in delirium and nondelirium groups before (18.12 ± 7.58 vs 16.8 ± 7.86; P = .477) and following surgery (13.39 ± 5.94 vs 11.12 ± 6.2; P = .639), but the levels increased in relation to baseline more frequently in patients who developed delirium (24.3% vs 7.8%; P = .034). The magnitude of postoperative cortisol elevation correlated with ΔIL-6 (P = .485; P = .002), ΔIL-8 (P = .429; P = .008), and ΔIL-10 (P = .544; P < .001) only in patients with delirium.

182,23859549,Modulatory activity of soluble beta amyloid on HPA axis function in rats.,"Despite the consolidation of the amyloid hypothesis, the main component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent findings have led to a conceptual shift opening new questions about the potential physiological role of this peptide. In addition, soluble beta amyloid (sBA), in transgenic AD model, resulted to be increased after chronic and acute stress and alterations in cortisol levels have been reported in AD. Impaired hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis has been linked to depressive state and, consistently, we have previously demonstrated that BA is able to provoke depressive-like profile in rats. Here we further analysed the effect of the peptide in behavioural paradigms used to study emotional and cognitive response, by using the passive avoidance task, for cognitive parameters, and the sucrose preference test (SPT), to evaluate anhedonia. Moreover, in order to correlate behavioural with neurochemical and neuroendocrinal data, we investigated the effects of the peptide on noradrenergic system in amygdala (AMY), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIPP) along with plasmatic corticosterone and hypothalamic corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). We found that BA-treated animals showed an impaired memory consolidation of inhibitory avoidance training, while no effect was evident in SPT. These results lead us to hypothesize a different response to stress coping behaviour in BA treated rats. Moreover, BA caused a significant increase in noradrenaline (NA) in PFC and HIPP, while in AMY was decreased. Consistently, we found a significant decrease in plasma corticosterone concentrations in BA-treated rats. Taken together, our data suggest that BA exerts an inhibitory effect on HPA axis activation.",[],Current pharmaceutical design,2013-07-19,"[{'lastname': 'Morgese', 'firstname': 'Maria Grazia', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tucci', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Colaianna', 'firstname': 'Marilena', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zotti', 'firstname': 'Margherita', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cuomo', 'firstname': 'Vincenzo', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schiavone', 'firstname': 'Stefania', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Trabace', 'firstname': 'Luigia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine c/o OO.RR., University of Foggia, Viale L.

183,23623464,[Contributions of cortisol suppression tests to understanding of psychiatric disorders: a narrative review of literature].,"Activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis had been studied for the past half century, when some researchers noted that some patients with Cushing's syndrome and severe mood disorders had high baseline cortisol levels, which resulted in an inhibited response in the 1mg dexamethasone suppression test. Altered dexamethasone suppression test results were subsequently found in many psychiatric diseases, including anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, degenerative dementia, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia. The relationship between high baseline cortisol levels and stress has also been studied. Some researches on the genesis of borderline personality disorder focused on traumatic childhood backgrounds. Other investigations aimed at elucidating the relationship between traumatic backgrounds and some psychiatric disorders noted that patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder showed an enhanced cortisol suppression with low cortisol doses (0.5 mg). Recent studies showed that use of an ultra-low dose of cortisol during the dexamethasone suppression test may be helpful for detecting disorders with hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Recent advances in neuroimaging support the existence of hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with borderline personality disorder, relating a decreased pituitary gland volume to major traumatic backgrounds and suicidal attempts. The purpose of this paper is to make a narrative review of research using dexamethasone suppression test in psychiatric disorders, in order to ascertain its value as a supplemental diagnostic test or as a prognostic marker.","['Borderline personality disorder', 'Cortisol', 'Depresión', 'Depression', 'Dexametasona', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dexamethasone suppression test', 'Eje hipotálamo-hipofisario-adrenal', 'Estrés', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'Stress', 'Test supresión dexametosona', 'Trastorno límite personalidad']",Endocrinologia y nutricion : organo de la Sociedad Espanola de Endocrinologia y Nutricion,2013-04-30,"[{'lastname': 'Tajima-Pozo', 'firstname': 'Kazuhiro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Endocrinología y Nutrición, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, España. doctortajimapozo@gmail.com'}, {'lastname': 'Montes-Montero', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Güemes', 'firstname': 'Itziar', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'González-Vives', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Díaz-Marsá', 'firstname': 'Marina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carrasco', 'firstname': 'José Luis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright © 2012 SEEN.

There are limited data on the potential human-to-human transmission of NDAPs associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other non-PrPsc ND.
To examine evidence for human-to-human transmission of AD, Parkinson disease (PD), and related NDAPs in cadaveric human growth hormone (c-hGH) recipients.
We conducted a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of pathological NDAPs other than PrPsc in human pituitary glands. We also searched for ND in recipients of pituitary-derived c-hGH by reviewing the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) cohort database and medical literature.
University-based academic center and agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services.
Thirty-four routine autopsy subjects (10 non-ND controls and 24 patients with ND) and a US cohort of c-hGH recipients in the NHPP.
Detectable NDAPs in human pituitary sections and death certificate reports of non-PrPsc ND in the NHPP database.
We found mild amounts of pathological tau, Aβ, and α-synuclein deposits in the adeno/neurohypophysis of patients with ND and control patients. No cases of AD or PD were identified, and 3 deaths attributed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were found among US NHPP c-hGH recipients, including 2 of the 796 decedents in the originally confirmed NHPP c-hGH cohort database.
Despite the likely frequent exposure of c-hGH recipients to NDAPs, and their markedly elevated risk of PrPsc-related disease, this population of NHPP c-hGH recipients does not appear to be at increased risk of AD or PD. We discovered 3 ALS cases of unclear significance among US c-hGH recipients despite the absence of pathological deposits of ALS-associated proteins (TDP-43, FUS, and ubiquilin) in human pituitary glands. In this unique in vivo model of human-to-human transmission, we found no evidence to support concerns that NDAPs underlying AD and PD transmit disease in humans despite evidence of their cell-to-cell transmission in model systems of these disorders.

Compared with the healthy controls, the patients with AD had significantly lower levels of TRH (67.72 ± 18.44 vs 78.64 ± 14.31 pmol/L; t = 2.078; P = 0.036), TSH (3.89 ± 1.22 vs 4.31 ± 1.07 mIU/L; t = 2.331; P = 0.024), TT3 (1.44 ± 0.21 vs 1.63 ± 0.19 nmol/L; t = 3.761; P = 0.018), TT4 (119.71 ± 18.64 nmol/L vs 129.54 ± 23.17 nmol/L; t = 1.328; P = 0.044), FT3 (4.01 ± 1.27 vs 5.41 ± 0.99 pmol/L; t = 4.976; P = 0.008), and FT4 (9.84 ± 1.56 vs 12.96 ± 2.20 pmol/L; t = 5.381; P = 0.006). In the AD cases, none of the correlations between TRH and TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4, and between TSH and TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 was significant. However, in the healthy controls, TRH was significantly correlated with TSH (R = 0.020; P = 0.042) and FT4 (R = 0.015; P = 0.018), and TSH was significantly correlated with TT4 (R = 0.209; P = 0.017) and FT4 (R = 0.215; P = 0.009).

188,23352029,Sleep loss as risk factor for neurologic disorders: a review.,"Sleep loss refers to sleep of shorter duration than the average baseline need of seven to eight hours per night. Sleep loss and sleep deprivation have severe effects on human health. In this article, we review the main aspects of sleep loss, taking into account its effects on the central nervous system. The neurocognitive and behavioral effects of sleep loss are well known. However, there is an increasing amount of research pointing to sleep deprivation as a risk factor for neurologic diseases, namely stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, headache, epilepsy, pain, and somnambulism. Conversely, sleep loss has been reported to be a potential protective factor against Parkinson's disease. The pathophysiology involved in this relationship is multiple, comprising immune, neuroendocrine, autonomic, and vascular mechanisms. It is extremely important to identify the individuals at risk, since recognition and adequate treatment of their sleep problems may reduce the risk of certain neurologic disorders.",[],Sleep medicine,2013-01-29,"[{'lastname': 'Palma', 'firstname': 'Jose-Alberto', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Sleep Unit, Clinical Neurophysiology Section, University Clinic of Navarra, School of Medicine, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Urrestarazu', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Iriarte', 'firstname': 'Jorge', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

189,23273603,Deregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functions in an Alzheimer's disease rat model.,"Elevated cortisol evidence in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients prompted the hypothesis that stress and glucocorticoids are involved in the development and/or maintenance of AD. We investigated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, functionality, and reactivity for up to 6 weeks after an intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-β(25-35) peptide (Aβ(25-35)) in rat, a validated acute model of AD. Aβ(25-35) induces memory impairment, alteration of anxiety responses, HPA axis hyperactivity, and glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor increases in brain regions related to HPA axis functions. GR are progressively translocated in neurons nucleus, while membrane version of MR is evidenced in all structures considered. The MR/GR ratio was modified in all structures considered. Aβ(25-35) induces a subtle disturbance in the feedback of the HPA axis, without modifying its functionality. The reactivity alteration is long-lasting, suggesting that amyloid toxicity affects the HPA axis adaptive response to stress. These findings are evidence of progressive HPA axis deregulation after Aβ(25-35), which is associated with an imbalance of MR/GR ratio and a disruption of the glucocorticoid receptors nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and suggest that elevated glucocorticoids observed in AD could be first a consequence of amyloid toxicity.",[],Neurobiology of aging,2013-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Brureau', 'firstname': 'Anthony', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U710, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Zussy', 'firstname': 'Charleine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Delair', 'firstname': 'Brice', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ogier', 'firstname': 'Charline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ixart', 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maurice', 'firstname': 'Tangui', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Givalois', 'firstname': 'Laurent', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

19855365",Expression of mutant huntingtin in leptin receptor-expressing neurons does not control the metabolic and psychiatric phenotype of the BACHD mouse.,"Metabolic and psychiatric disturbances occur early on in the clinical manifestation of Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Hypothalamus has emerged as an important site of pathology and alterations in this area and its neuroendocrine circuits may play a role in causing early non-motor symptoms and signs in HD. Leptin is a hormone that controls energy homeostasis by signaling through leptin receptors in the hypothalamus. Disturbed leptin action is implicated in both obesity and depression and altered circulating levels of leptin have been reported in both clinical HD and rodent models of the disease. Pathological leptin signaling may therefore be involved in causing the metabolic and psychiatric disturbances of HD. Here we tested the hypothesis that expression of mutant HTT in leptin receptor carrying neurons plays a role in the development of the non-motor phenotype in the BACHD mouse model. Our results show that inactivation of mutant HTT in leptin receptor-expressing neurons in the BACHD mouse using cross-breeding based on a cre-loxP system did not have an effect on the metabolic phenotype or anxiety-like behavior. The data suggest that mutant HTT disrupts critical hypothalamic pathways by other mechanisms than interfering with intracellular leptin signaling.",[],PloS one,2012-12-20,"[{'lastname': 'Lundh', 'firstname': 'Sofia Hult', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. sofia.hult@med.lu.se'}, {'lastname': 'Soylu', 'firstname': 'Rana', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Asa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0051168,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc6c0720>

22307626",Beneficial effects of novel antagonists of GHRH in different models of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent debilitating disorder of the central nervous system. Neuroendocrine mechanisms appear to play an important role in this insidiously developing disease. In the present study, the effects of a recently developed growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonist (MIA-690) were evaluated in vivo observing the behavior of genetically modified ""Alzheimer's"" 5XFAD mice in a Morris water maze (MWM). The effects of the antagonist were also evaluated in vitro using HCN2 human cortical cell cultures treated with amyloid-β1-42. In vivo, the indices of cognitive performance (latency, cumulative index etc.) were followed up for 6 months. In vitro, the formation of reactive oxygen species, markers of inflammatory and neurohormonal signaling were measured by fluorescent detection, PCR, and ELISA. Accumulation of amyloid-β1-42 rafts and τ filaments in necropsied brain samples was verified with the help of ELISA. In the MWM experiments, MIA-690 decreased escape latency, and, in the brain samples, it inhibited the concentration of amyloid-β1-42 and τ filaments. In cell cultures, the GHRH analog showed anti-oxidative and neuro-protective properties and inhibited the GHRH-growth hormone-insulin like growth factor axis. Our data strongly suggest the merit of further studies with GHRH analogs in models of Alzheimer's disease and in elementary clinical trials.",[],Aging,2012-12-06,"[{'lastname': 'Jaszberenyi', 'firstname': 'Miklos', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine, Polypeptide, and Cancer Institute, Miami Veterans Affairs Medical Center and South Florida VA Foundation for Research and Education, Miami, FL 33125, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rick', 'firstname': 'Ferenc G', 'initials': 'FG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Szalontay', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Block', 'firstname': 'Norman L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zarandi', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Ren-Zhi', 'initials': 'RZ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schally', 'firstname': 'Andrew V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.18632/aging.100504,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc6a3130>

8505640",The relationship between cortisol and verbal memory in the early stages of Huntington's disease.,"Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity has been linked to learning and memory difficulties in a range of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. In Huntington's disease (HD), both declines in learning and memory and HPA axis dysfunction are present early in the disease. However, the relationship between specific learning and memory deficits and HPA axis functioning in HD has not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate cortisol levels in relation to verbal learning and memory in pre-diagnosed (pre-HD) participants and patients at the early stages of diagnosed HD (early-HD). Cortisol concentration was assayed in saliva samples from 57 participants (17 early-HD, 20 pre-HD, and 20 controls) at four time-points across a 24-h period. Verbal memory was assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II). We focused statistical analyses on the late evening cortisol concentration, and examined cortisol levels and verbal memory function in relation to diagnostic group (control, pre-HD, early-HD), and in a separate set of analyses combining pre-HD and early-HD (and excluding controls) we also examined cortisol and verbal memory performance in relation to the severity of HD-related motor signs. Of these two classification approaches, HD motor sign severity was more strongly associated with high evening cortisol levels and both reduced information encoding and memory retrieval. Separately, there was also a trend of higher cortisol levels in pre-HD. The findings suggest hypercortisolism and the underlying pathological changes may begin many years before a clinical diagnosis is made, but the memory decline associated with HPA axis disturbance may only become detectable once motor signs become pronounced.",[],Journal of neurology,2012-11-28,"[{'lastname': 'Shirbin', 'firstname': 'Christopher A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology and Psychiatry, Monash University, Clayton Campus, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chua', 'firstname': 'Phyllis', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Churchyard', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hannan', 'firstname': 'Anthony J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lowndes', 'firstname': 'Georgia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stout', 'firstname': 'Julie C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s00415-012-6732-y,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcb06c20>

19818455",Impaired satiation and increased feeding behaviour in the triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with non-cognitive symptoms such as changes in feeding behaviour that are often characterised by an increase in appetite. Increased food intake is observed in several mouse models of AD including the triple transgenic (3×TgAD) mouse, but the mechanisms underlying this hyperphagia are unknown. We therefore examined feeding behaviour in 3×TgAD mice and tested their sensitivity to exogenous and endogenous satiety factors by assessing food intake and activation of key brain regions. In the behavioural satiety sequence (BSS), 3×TgAD mice consumed more food after a fast compared to Non-Tg controls. Feeding and drinking behaviours were increased and rest decreased in 3×TgAD mice, but the overall sequence of behaviours in the BSS was maintained. Exogenous administration of the satiety factor cholecystokinin (CCK; 8-30 µg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently reduced food intake in Non-Tg controls and increased inactive behaviour, but had no effect on food intake or behaviour in 3×TgAD mice. CCK (15 µg/kg, i.p.) increased c-Fos protein expression in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and area postrema of the brainstem to the same extent in Non-Tg and 3×TgAD mice, but less c-Fos positive cells were detected in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus of CCK-treated 3×TgAD compared to Non-Tg mice. In response to a fast or a period of re-feeding, there was no difference in the number of c-Fos-positive cells detected in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, NTS and area postrema of 3×TgAD compared to Non-Tg mice. The degree of c-Fos expression in the NTS was positively correlated to food intake in Non-Tg mice, however, this relationship was absent in 3×TgAD mice. These data demonstrate that 3×TgAD mice show increased feeding behaviour and insensitivity to satiation, which is possibly due to defective gut-brain signalling in response to endogenous satiety factors released by food ingestion.",[],PloS one,2012-10-12,"[{'lastname': 'Adebakin', 'firstname': 'Adedolapo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Bradley', 'firstname': 'Jenna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gümüsgöz', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Waters', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lawrence', 'firstname': 'Catherine B', 'initials': 'CB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0045179,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcaf66d0>

The glucocorticoids (GCs) that are released into the circulation upon acute activation of the HPA axis perform stress-adaptive functions and provide negative feedback to turn off the HPA axis, but can be detrimental when in excess. Long-term activation of the HPA axis (such as with chronic stress) enhances susceptibility to neuronal dysfunction and death, and increases vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known how components of the HPA axis, upstream of GCs, impact vulnerability to AD. This study examined basal gene expression of stress-related molecules in brains of 3xTg-AD mice during early-stage pathology. Basal GC levels and mRNA expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and corticotropic releasing hormone (CRH) in several stress- and emotionality-related brain regions were measured in 3-4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Despite normal GC levels, young 3xTg-AD mice exhibit an activated central HPA axis, with altered mRNA levels of MR and GR in the hippocampus, GR and CRH in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, GR and CRH in the central nucleus of the amygdala, and CRH in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. This HPA axis activation is present during early-stage neuropathology when 3xTg-AD mice show mild behavioral changes, suggesting an ongoing neuroendocrine regulation that precedes the onset of severe AD-like pathology and behavioral deficits.",[],Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2012-09-15,"[{'lastname': 'Hebda-Bauer', 'firstname': 'Elaine K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. hebda@umich.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Simmons', 'firstname': 'Tracy A', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sugg', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ural', 'firstname': 'Eren', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stewart', 'firstname': 'James A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beals', 'firstname': 'James L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wei', 'firstname': 'Qiang', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Watson', 'firstname': 'Stanley J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Akil', 'firstname': 'Huda', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-2012-121438,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d95ab4a0>

9287218",Environmental enrichment rescues female-specific hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in a model of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) has long been regarded as a disease of the central nervous system, partly due to typical disease symptoms that include loss of motor control, cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric disturbances. However, the huntingtin gene is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. We had previously reported a female-specific depression-related behavioural phenotype in the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD. One hypothesis suggests that pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the key physiological stress-response system that links central and peripheral organs, is a cause of depression. There is evidence of HPA axis pathology in HD, but whether it contributes to the female R6/1 behavioural phenotype is unclear. We have examined HPA axis response of R6/1 mice following acute stress and found evidence of a female-specific dysregulation of the HPA axis in R6/1 mice, which we further isolated to a hyper-response of adrenal cortical cells to stimulation by adrenocorticotrophin hormone. Interestingly, the adrenal pathophysiology was not detected in mice that had been housed in environmentally enriching conditions, an effect of enrichment that was also reproduced in vitro. This constitutes the first evidence that environmental enrichment can in fact exert a lasting influence on peripheral organ function. Cognitive stimulation may therefore not only have benefits for mental function, but also for overall physiological wellbeing.",[],Translational psychiatry,2012-07-05,"[{'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'X', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Neural Plasticity Laboratory, Behavioural Neuroscience Division, Florey Neuroscience Institutes, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Leang', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mustafa', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Renoir', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pang', 'firstname': 'T Y', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hannan', 'firstname': 'A J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1038/tp.2012.58,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d95bba90>
196,22672384,Androgen function in the pathophysiology and treatment of male Huntington's disease patients.,"Low concentrations of circulating testosterone have been associated with dementia manifesting with advancing age and in neurodegenerative conditions. Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease with an invariably fatal outcome. Severe motor symptoms, psychosis and dementia are symptomatic hallmarks of the progression of HD that result from the dysfunction and death of neocortical and basal ganglia neurones. Treatments are directed toward manifest symptoms, although they are largely ineffectual in slowing or preventing disease progression. Emerging data have identified hypothamic pathologies in HD that result in endocrine disturbances. Clinically defined primary or secondary hypogonadism elicit low circulating testosterone concentrations and have been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease in men. Examining similar neuroendocrine dysfunction in HD including the nature of manifest hypogonadism in male patients could allow an elucidation of the complex pathophysiology of HD and provide an impetus for hitherto untested testosterone replacement therapy.",[],Journal of neuroendocrinology,2012-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Ransome', 'firstname': 'M I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Florey Neuroscience Institutes, Melbourne Brain Centre, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. mark.ransome@florey.edu.au'}]",,,,© 2012 Florey Neuroscience Institutes Journal of Neuroendocrinology © 2012 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/j.1365-2826.2012.02347.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc9254a0>
197,22524398,Possible usefulness of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis in Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been traditionally conceptualized as a clinicopathological entity, its definite diagnosis requiring the presence of characteristic pathology together with a dementia clinical picture. The fact that certain AD biomarkers show an acceptable sensitivity and specificity to detect AD pathology has shifted the diagnostic paradigm towards a clinicobiological approach. Neuropathological analysis of AD-affected brains reveals extensive atrophy due to neuronal loss, and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, surrounded by a tract of neuroinflammation and loss of neurons. Recently, emerging evidence supports the concept that AD is also a disorder of metabolic degeneration. Taken together, the neurochemical changes in the brain from patients with AD indicate multiple disturbances and it seems likely that the changes are secondary to more fundamental changes into the brain. There is a physiological decline of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis with ageing and the possibility that the GH/ IGF-I axis is involved in cognitive deficits has been recognized for several years. The IGF-I is a potent neurotrophic as well neuroprotective factor found in the brain with a wide range of actions in both central and peripheral nervous system. IGF-I is a critical promoter of brain development and neuronal survival and plays a role in neuronal rescue during degenerative diseases. The investigations of GH releasing stimulation tests especially to GHRH in AD are equivocal and in some cases contradictory. When a cholinesterase inhibitor as rivastigmine, a drug for AD, is acutely administered the area under the curve of the GH response to GHRH doubled, showing that rivastigmine is a powerful drug to enhance GH release. Starting with a more accurate diagnosis not of the clinical syndrome, but of underlying molecular defects, that may eventually lead to a personalized, more effective treatment. Hence, the development of novel therapeutic approaches is urgently needed.",[],"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2012-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Sáez', 'firstname': 'José Manuel Gómez', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Endocrinología y Nutrición, Hospital Universitario de Bellvitge, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Barcelona, L´Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain. jmgs@bellvitgehospital.cat'}]",,,,,10.2174/187153012802002857,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc922c70>

15699459",Central cardiovascular circuits contribute to the neurovascular dysfunction in angiotensin II hypertension.,"Hypertension, a powerful risk factor for stroke and dementia, has damaging effects on the brain and its vessels. In particular, hypertension alters vital cerebrovascular control mechanisms linking neural activity to cerebral perfusion. In experimental models of slow-developing hypertension, free radical signaling in the subfornical organ (SFO), one of the forebrain circumventricular organs, is critical for the hormonal release and sympathetic activation driving the elevation in arterial pressure. However, the contribution of this central mechanism to the cerebrovascular alterations induced by hypertension remains uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that free radical production in the SFO is involved in the alterations in cerebrovascular regulation produced by hypertension. In a mouse model of gradual hypertension induced by chronic administration of subpressor doses of angiotensin II (AngII), suppression of free radicals in the SFO by overexpression of CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) prevented the alteration in neurovascular coupling and endothelium-dependent responses in somatosensory cortex induced by hypertension. The SFO mediates the dysfunction via two signaling pathways. One involves SFO-dependent activation of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, elevations in plasma vasopressin, upregulation of endothelin-1 in cerebral resistance arterioles and activation of endothelin type A receptors. The other pathway depends on activation of cerebrovascular AngII type 1 (AT1) receptors by AngII. Both pathways mediate vasomotor dysfunction by inducing vascular oxidative stress. The findings implicate for the first time the SFO and its efferent hypothalamic pathways in the cerebrovascular alterations induced by AngII, and identify vasopressin and endothelin-1 as potential therapeutic targets to counteract the devastating effects of hypertension on the brain.",[],The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2012-04-12,"[{'lastname': 'Capone', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, Division of Neurobiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10021, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Faraco', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Coleman', 'firstname': 'Christal', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Anrather', 'firstname': 'Josef', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Milner', 'firstname': 'Teresa A', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pickel', 'firstname': 'Virginia M', 'initials': 'VM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Davisson', 'firstname': 'Robin L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Iadecola', 'firstname': 'Costantino', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6262-11.2012,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc95cc70>

Our increasing repertoire of evidence-based psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, and neurotherapeutic treatment interventions offers many treatment alternatives, allowing substantial individualization of treatment approach. Demonstration of the effectiveness of depression treatment in primary care suggests the feasibility of increasing our patients’ access to care. Growing appreciation of the pathophysiology of depression and its interrelationships with cognitive impairment may increase our ability to limit or delay certain aspects of cognitive impairment through more aggressive treatment of depression.

The number corticotropin-releasing hormone, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin immunoreactive (ir) neurons did not differ between HD patients and control subjects. However, the significant positive correlation between arginine vasopressin and oxytocin ir neurons in control subjects (P = 0.036) was absent in patients. Corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA levels were 68% higher in HD patients (P = 0.046). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone mRNA levels did not differ between HD patients and control subjects, although a negative correlation with disease duration was present in the former (P = 0.036). These findings indicate that the PVN is largely unaffected in HD patients. However, our findings suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity may alter during the course of the disease and that autonomic nervous system dysfunction might partly arise from an imbalance between arginine vasopressin and oxytocin neurons in the PVN.",[],"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",2012-01-20,"[{'lastname': 'van Wamelen', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, an Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, Amsterdam ZO, The Netherlands. d.j.van_wamelen@lumc.nl'}, {'lastname': 'Aziz', 'firstname': 'N Ahmad', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Anink', 'firstname': 'Jasper J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roos', 'firstname': 'Raymund A C', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'Dick F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2012 The Authors; Brain Pathology © 2012 International Society of Neuropathology.,10.1111/j.1750-3639.2012.00565.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc9ed680>
202,25063186,Hypothalamic and Limbic System Changes in Huntington's Disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. Today, the clinical diagnosis of the disease requires unequivocal signs of typical motor disturbances, which is thought to be due to pathology in the striatum of the basal ganglia. Increasing numbers of studies have emphasized that also non-motor symptoms and signs are common and occur early in HD. These include psychiatric disturbances and cognitive impairment as well as sleep disturbances with disrupted circadian rhythm, autonomic dysfunction and metabolic changes. Several of the non-motor features may be results of dysfunction of the hypothalamus and the limbic system, which are interconnected structures central in the regulation of emotion, sleep and metabolism. In fact, recent studies using postmortem tissue, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography have shown that hypothalamic and limbic system changes occur early in clinical HD. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge in this area based on clinical studies as well as experiments in animal models of the disease and establishes that hypothalamic and limbic system changes are part of the HD pathology.","['Huntingtin', 'amygdala', 'huntington', 'hypothalamus', 'orexin', 'oxytocin']",Journal of Huntington's disease,2012-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Asa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

In this study, we examine if greater cortisol responses to an acute stressor and/or dysregulated patterns of daily cortisol secretion are associated with shorter telomere length. Twenty-three postmenopausal women comprising caregivers for dementia partners (n=14) and age- and BMI-matched non-caregivers provided home sampling of cortisol-saliva samples at waking, 30 min after waking, and bedtime, and a 12-hour overnight urine collection. They were also exposed to an acute laboratory stressor throughout which they provided saliva samples. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from a fasting blood sample and assayed for telomere length. As hypothesized, greater cortisol responses to the acute stressor were associated with shorter telomeres, as were higher overnight urinary free cortisol levels and flatter daytime cortisol slopes. While robust physiological responses to acute stress serve important functions, the long-term consequences of frequent high stress reactivity may include accelerated telomere shortening.",[],Physiology & behavior,2011-12-06,"[{'lastname': 'Tomiyama', 'firstname': 'A Janet', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Rutgers University, NJ, United States.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Donovan"", 'firstname': 'Aoife', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Jue', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Puterman', 'firstname': 'Eli', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lazaro', 'firstname': 'Alanie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dhabhar', 'firstname': 'Firdaus S', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wolkowitz', 'firstname': 'Owen', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kirschbaum', 'firstname': 'Clemens', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Blackburn', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Epel', 'firstname': 'Elissa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we aimed to distinguish phosphorylated α-synuclein (pαSyn)-positive deposits in the PPL, as is observed in Lewy body- and non-Lewy body-related disorders. PαSyn deposits were immunohistochemically analyzed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PPL specimens obtained from 60 autopsy cases. Among the cases with Lewy body-related disorders, PPL pαSyn deposits were observed in almost all cases of Parkinson's disease (22/23), and in one case of dementia with Lewy bodies (1/1). On the other hand, only 3/36 cases of non-Lewy body-related disorders had pαSyn immunoreactivity in the PPL. The present study confirms the presence of pαSyn-positive deposits, as demonstrated by high specificity (97.1%) and sensitivity (88.5%), in both Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting that this finding can be a useful hallmark of Lewy body-related disorders.",[],Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,2011-11-16,"[{'lastname': 'Homma', 'firstname': 'Taku', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital, Fuchu, Tokyo Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University, Iruma-gun, Saitama, Japan. homma.taku@gmail.com'}, {'lastname': 'Mochizuki', 'firstname': 'Yoko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mizutani', 'firstname': 'Toshio', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2011 Japanese Society of Neuropathology.,10.1111/j.1440-1789.2011.01273.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d98ad5e0>
206,22074584,Relevance of the chronobiological and non-chronobiological actions of melatonin for enhancing therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Melatonin is an indolamine with a large spectrum of functions that can be divided into chronobiotic and nonchronobiotic. Chronobiotic effects are mediated by the daily rhythm of melatonin in the plasma due to nocturnal pineal synthesis, whereas the melatonin produced by other cells, such as gastrointestinal and immune competent cells, is independent of the light/dark cycle and exert non-chronobiotic effects. The concentrations achieved by the two sources are significantly different, varying in the pM-nM range in the plasma, and may achieve concentrations in the mM range when released locally by activated immune-competent cells. Consequently, the effects of the melatonin produced in these two situations are distinct. Much has been reported about the beneficial response to exogenous melatonin administration in several pathological conditions. However, the relationship between the establishment of a disease and the state of the physiological activity of the pineal gland is still poorly understood. Here, we review the state of art in the modulation of pineal melatonin synthesis, relevant patents, and discuss its relationship with neurodegenerative disorders that involve a central inflammatory response, such as Alzheimer's disease, to suggest the putative relevance of new therapeutic protocols that replace this pineal hormone.",[],"Recent patents on endocrine, metabolic & immune drug discovery",2011-11-15,"[{'lastname': 'Cecon', 'firstname': 'Erika', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Chronopharmacology Bioscience Institute University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Markus', 'firstname': 'Regina P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.2174/187221411799015381,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d98c1270>
207,22043986,Does physical activity reduce risk for Alzheimer's disease through interaction with the stress neuroendocrine system?,"Lack of physical activity (PA) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and PA interventions are believed to provide an effective non-pharmacological approach for attenuating the symptoms of this disease. However, the mechanism of action of these positive effects is currently unknown. It is possible that the benefits may be at least partially mediated by the effects on the neuroendocrine stress system. Chronic stress can lead to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to aberrant basal and circadian patterns of cortisol secretion and a cascade of negative downstream events. These factors have been linked not only to reduced cognitive function but also increased levels of amyloid-β plaques and protein tau ""tangles"" (the neuropathological hallmarks of AD) in the non-demented mouse models of this disease. However, there is evidence that PA can have restorative effects on the stress neuroendocrine system and related risk factors relevant to AD. We explore the possibility that PA can positively impact upon AD by restoring normative HPA axis function, with consequent downstream effects upon underlying neuropathology and associated cognitive function. We conclude with suggestions for future research to test this hypothesis in patients with AD.",[],"Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2011-11-03,"[{'lastname': 'Tortosa-Martínez', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Physical Activity and Sports Sciences, University of Alicante , 03690 San Vicente del Raspeig - Alicante , Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Clow', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.3109/10253890.2011.629323,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d98b8b80>

209,21878805,Serotonergic function and treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of frontotemporal dementia.,"The purposes of this study were first, to evaluate the effectiveness of citalopram in treating behavioral disturbances in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) subjects and second, to determine whether an association exists between serotonergic function, as determined by a neuroendocrine challenge, and treatment response.
Single-dose citalopram (30 mg per os) challenge followed by a 6-week open-label study.
Outpatients referred to memory clinics.
Fifteen patients suffering from FTD with severe behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.
Following citalopram challenge, all patients were treated with citalopram titrated to a target dose of 40 mg once daily.
Behavioral disturbances, using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (primary outcome) and Frontal Behavioural Inventory (secondary outcome), were assessed. Change in prolactin concentration following citalopram challenge was used as an index of central serotonergic response.
Citalopram treatment was effective in treating behavioral symptoms, with significant decreases in NPI total score (F[2, 28] = 6.644, p = 0.004), disinhibition (F[2, 28] = 4.030, p = 0.029), irritability (F[2, 28] = 7.497, p = 0.003) and depression (F[2, 28] = 3.467, p = 0.045) scores over the 6 weeks. Significant improvement in Frontal Behavioural Inventory scores suggested that citalopram was also effective in the treatment ofbehaviors specific to FTD. A lower change score in concentration of prolactin was significantly positively correlated with greater improvement in the total NPI score from baseline to endpoint (r = 0.687, p = 0.005). A blunted response to a citalopram challenge, implying a dysfunctional serotonergic system, predicted a more positive treatment outcome.

210,21834781,Pharmacological strategies against glucocorticoid-mediated brain damage during chronic disorders.,"The brain controls coping with aversive situations, modulating the activity of the adaptive systems (the nervous, endocrine and immune systems). In this review, we focus the involvement of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the stress response. In the physiological response, the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus secretes CRH (corticotrophin releasing hormone) that stimulates pituitary ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), through CRH-receptor type 1 (CRH-R1). In turn, ACTH activates adrenal glands to produce cortisol, acting on type-2 melanocortin receptors (MC2-R). The glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibits the HPA axis activity through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The hippocampus plays a central role as an important connection between cortex and hypothalamus, and, together with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), regulates cortisol rhythm. Peripherally, an important regulator of cortisol metabolism in local tissues is 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), that produces cortisol within the splanchnic bed. The stress response during chronic conditions increases vulnerability to diseases through the activation of adaptive systems, in particular, the HPA axis. Increased levels of allostatic load (a measure of stress with multisystem dysregulation) are associated with the development of functional and cognitive decline, frailty and with mortality in high-functioning older adults. Moreover, HPA axis hyperactivity is a feature that can be present in chronic diseases, affecting endocrine (abdominal obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus), cardiovascular (atherosclerosis, essential hypertension) and nervous system (dementia, depression), particularly during comorbid conditions. In conclusion, the spectrum of molecules interacting at the different levels of HPA axis is exponentially increasing, ranging from supra-hypothalamic targets to post-receptor mechanisms and it includes agents acting on SCN, CRH-R1 receptor, adrenal steroidogenesis, GR and peripheral/central 11β-HSD1 enzyme. This area of research is rapidly advancing in order to develop therapeutic strategies to counteract HPA axis hyperactivity and to reduce the burden of stress-related disorders.

7367105","Of sound mind and body: depression, disease, and accelerated aging.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a high rate of developing serious medical comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. These are conditions that typically occur late in life, and it has been suggested that MDD may be associated with ""accelerated aging."" We review several moderators and mediators that may accompany MDD and that may give rise to these comorbid medical conditions. We first review the moderating effects of psychological styles of coping, genetic predisposition, and epigenetic modifications (eg, secondary to childhood adversity). We then focus on several interlinked mediators occurring in MDD (or at least in subtypes of MDD) that may contribute to the medical comorbidity burden and to accelerated aging: limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations, diminution in glucocorticoid receptor function, altered glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, excitotoxicity, increases in intracellular calcium, oxidative stress, a proinflammatory milieu, lowered levels of ""counter-regulatory"" neurosteroids (such as allopregnanolone and dehydroepiandrosterone), diminished neurotrophic activity, and accelerated cell aging, manifest as alterations in telomerase activity and as shortening of telomeres, which can lead to apoptosis and cell death. In this model, MDD is characterized by a surfeit of potentially destructive mediators and an insufficiency of protective or restorative ones. These factors interact in increasing the likelihood of physical disease and of accelerated aging at the cellular level. We conclude with suggestions for novel mechanism-based therapeutics based on these mediators.
El trastorno depresivo mayor (TDM) tiene una alta frecuencia de asociación con el desarrollo de importantes comorbilidades médicas como enfermedad cardiovascular, accidentes vasculares, demencia, osteoporosis, diabetes y síndrome metabólico. Estas son patologías que de preferencia ocurren en la edad tardía de la vida y se ha propuesto que el TDM puede estar asociado con un “envejecimiento acelerado”. Se revisan algunos moderadores y mediadores que pueden acompañar al TDM y dar origen a estas condiciones médicas comórbidas. En primer lugar se revisan los efectos moderadores de los estilos psicológicos de adaptación, de la predisposición genética y de las modificaciones epigenéticas (por ejemplo, secundarias a la adversidad infantil). A continuación se revisan algunos mediadores interrelacionados que se presentan en el TDM (o al menos en algunos subtipos de TDM) que pueden incidir en la comorbilidad médica y en el envejecimiento acelerado: alteraciones del eje límbicohipotalámico-hipofisiario-adrenal, disminución de la función de los receptores de glucocorticoides, alteraciones en la tolerancia a la glucosa y en la sensibilidad a la insulina, excitotoxicidad, aumento del calcio intracelular, estrés oxidativo, un ambiente proinflamatorio, reducción de los niveles de neuroesteroides “contra-reguladores” (como alopregnanolona y dehidroepiandrosterona), disminución de la actividad neurotrófica y un envejecimiento celular acelerado que se manifiesta en alteraciones de la actividad de la telomerasa y acortamiento de los telómeros, lo que puede llevar a la apoptosis y la muerte celular. En este modelo, el TDM está caracterizado por un exceso de mediadores potencialmente destructores y una insuficiencia de los protectores o restauradores. Estos factores interactúan aumentando la posibilidad de enfermedad física y de un envejecimiento acelerado a nivel celular. Se concluye con propuestas de nuevas terapias basadas en los mecanismos que regulan estos mediadores.
Le trouble dépressif majeur (TDM) est associé à un taux élevé de comorbidités graves comme les pathologies card iovasculaires, les accidents vasculaires cérébrauxl (AVC), la démence, l'ostéoporose, le diabète et le syndrome métabolique. Ces pathologies surviennent habituellement tard dans la vie, et c'est pourquoi certains ont suggéré que le TDM pourrait être associé à un « vieillissement accéléré ». Dans cette revue, nous analysons plusieurs modérateurs et médiateurs pouvant accompagner le TDM et susceptibles de précipiter ces comorbidités. Tout d'abord, nous passons en revue les effets modérateurs des stratégies psychologiques d'adaptation (coping), des prédispositions génétiques et des modifications épigénétiques (par ex secondaires à des difficultés dans l'enfance). Nous nous consacrons ensuite à plusieurs médiateurs liés entre eux intervenant dans le TDM (ou au moins dans certains sous-types de TDM) qui pourraient contribuer à la charge comorbide et à l'accélération du vieillissement: modifications de l'axe limbo-hypophyso-hypothalamo-surrénalien, diminution de la fonction du récepteur des glucocorticoïdes, modification de la tolérance au glucose et de la sensibilité à l'insuline, excitotoxicité, augmentation du calcium intracellulaire, stress oxydatif, un milieu proinflammatoire, abaissement des taux des neurostéroïdes « contre-régulateurs » (comme l'alloprégnanolone et la déhydroépiandrostérone), diminution de l'activité neurotrophique et accélération du vieillissement cellulaire, se manifestant par des modifications de l'activité de la télomérase et par un raccourcissement des télomères, pouvant conduire à l'apoptose et à la mort cellulaire. Dans ce modèle, le TDM se caractérise par un excès de médiateurs potentiellement destructeurs et par une insuffisance de médiateurs protecteurs et restaurateurs. Ces facteurs interagissent en augmentant la probabilité de pathologie physique et de vieillissement accéléré à un niveau cellulaire.

212,21454296,Circadian clock gene expression in brain regions of Alzheimer 's disease patients and control subjects.,"Circadian oscillators have been observed throughout the rodent brain. In the human brain, rhythmic expression of clock genes has been reported only in the pineal gland, and little is known about their expression in other regions. The investigators sought to determine whether clock gene expression could be detected and whether it varies as a function of time of day in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and cingulate cortex, areas known to be involved in decision making and motivated behaviors, as well as in the pineal gland, in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and aged controls. Relative expression levels of PERIOD1 (PER1 ), PERIOD2 (PER2), and Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) were detected by quantitative PCR in all 3 brain regions. A harmonic regression model revealed significant 24-h rhythms of PER1 in the BNST of AD subjects. A significant rhythm of PER2 was found in the cingulate cortex and BNST of control subjects and in all 3 regions of AD patients. In controls, BMAL1 did not show a diurnal rhythm in the cingulate cortex but significantly varied with time of death in the pineal and BNST and in all 3 regions for AD patients. Notable differences in the phase of clock gene rhythms and phase relationships between genes and regions were observed in the brains of AD compared to those of controls. These results indicate the presence of multiple circadian oscillators in the human brain and suggest altered synchronization among these oscillators in the brain of AD patients.",[],Journal of biological rhythms,2011-04-02,"[{'lastname': 'Cermakian', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Molecular Chronobiology, Douglas Mental Health University Institute, McGill University, 6875 LaSalle Blvd., Montreal (QC) H4H 1R3 Canada. nicolas.cermakian@mcgill.ca'}, {'lastname': 'Lamont', 'firstname': 'Elaine Waddington', 'initials': 'EW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Boudreau', 'firstname': 'Philippe', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Boivin', 'firstname': 'Diane B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2011 Sage Publications,10.1177/0748730410395732,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d924d860>

This article proposes a biobehavioral causal model to explain sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms in dementia (BSD) based on an integrative science perspective using the life cycle model of stress (chronic stress) integrating genetic, neuroendocrine, and personality factors. The model proposes that: (a) BSD are an outcome of sleep disturbance; (b) hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation is key to sleep disturbances and BSD; (c) genotype influences response to stress hormones; (d) HPA is influenced by genotype; (e) trait anxiety moderates the relationship between HPA axis and BSD and/or sleep disturbances; and (f) trait anxiety is influenced by genotype. Examining these relationships simultaneously will advance our theoretical understanding of BSD and sleep disturbances, potentially providing a basis for the design of targeted interventions and prevention strategies with an understanding of risk.",[],Research in gerontological nursing,2011-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Woods', 'firstname': 'Diana Lynn', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. lwoods@sonnet.ucla.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Phillips', 'firstname': 'Linda R', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"Copyright 2011, SLACK Incorporated.",10.3928/19404921-20110302-01,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9242540>

Dilutional hyponatremia was produced in adult rats to determine the effect on the morphology of the median eminence of the hypothalamus. Hyponatremia was caused by reducing electrolyte and organic osmolyte reserves to block the excretion of water through delivery of the nephrotoxin mercuric chloride (HgCl2). Histological examination of the brain 1 day after a hyponatremic insult revealed vacuolation within the median eminence of the hypothalamus. No other lesions were found in other parts of the brain after hyponatremia. The hyponatremic lesion consisted of a band of closely packed vacuoles that crossed the floor of the third ventricle. Vacuoles associated with hyponatremia were predominantly in the subependymal, fiber, reticular, and palisade layers of the median eminence. Vacuolation was not observed in the tanycyte layer of the median eminence. This study indicates that the median eminence is a potentially vulnerable site in human hyponatremic conditions that should be evaluated further in relevant animal models.",[],Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2011-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Levine', 'firstname': 'Seymour', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, New York 10962, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saltzman', 'firstname': 'Arthur', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ginsberg', 'firstname': 'Stephen D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/NEN.0b013e318208fc5d,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9235310>

Saliva was sampled 4 times in a 24-hour period (week 1) and at the same times 1 week later (week 2). In general, cortisol levels decreased from morning to evening, with 50% exhibiting a negative slope. In contrast, 38% of the participants had a relatively flat cortisol diurnal rhythm, and 7% exhibited an afternoon increase. The cortisol pattern was consistent between weeks 1 and 2 for 39% with a negative slope, 13% with a flat profile, and for 2% with an afternoon increase pattern. Cortisol rhythm was not statistically significantly related to cognition or illness burden.

216,21257974,Depression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation: a quantitative summary of four decades of research.,"To summarize quantitatively the literature comparing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function between depressed and nondepressed individuals and to describe the important sources of variability in this literature. These sources include methodological differences between studies, as well as demographic or clinical differences between depressed samples.
The current study used meta-analytic techniques to compare 671 effect sizes (cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, or corticotropin-releasing hormone) across 361 studies, including 18,454 individuals.
Although depressed individuals tended to display increased cortisol (d = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.66) and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels (d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.41), they did not display elevations in corticotropin-releasing hormone (d = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.47-0.51). The magnitude of the cortisol effect was reduced by almost half (d = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.21-0.45) when analyses were limited to studies that met minimal methodological standards. Gender did not significantly modify any HPA outcome. Studies that included older hospitalized individuals reported significantly greater cortisol differences between depressed and nondepressed groups compared with studies with younger outpatient samples. Important cortisol differences also emerged for atypical, endogenous, melancholic, and psychotic forms of depression.
The current study suggests that the degree of HPA hyperactivity can vary considerably across patient groups. Results are consistent with HPA hyperactivity as a link between depression and increased risk for conditions, such as diabetes, dementia, coronary heart disease, and osteoporosis. Such a link is strongest among older inpatients who display melancholic or psychotic features of depression.",[],Psychosomatic medicine,2011-01-25,"[{'lastname': 'Stetler', 'firstname': 'Cinnamon', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Furman University, 3300 Poinsett Hwy, Greenville, SC 29613, USA. cinnamon.stetler@furman.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'Gregory E', 'initials': 'GE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Although depressed individuals tended to display increased cortisol (d = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.66) and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels (d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.41), they did not display elevations in corticotropin-releasing hormone (d = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.47-0.51).

217,21241238,Neuroinflammation and ageing: current theories and an overview of the data.,"The increase in the average lifespan and the consequent proportional growth of the elderly segment of society has furthered the interest in studying ageing processes. Ageing may be considered a multifactorial process derived from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors including lifestyle. There is ample evidence in many species that the maximum age attainable (maximum lifespan potential, MLSP) is genetically determined and several mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms are associated with longevity. This review will address the current understanding of the relationship between ageing and several factors both genetics and life style related. Firstly we focused on the most reliable and commonly shared theories which attempt to explain the phenomenon of ageing as the genetic, cellular, neuroendocrine, immunological and free-radicals related theories. Many studies have shown that most of the phenotypic characteristics observed in the aging process are the result of the occurrence, with age, of a low grade chronic pro-inflammatory status called ""inflammaging"", partially under genetic control. The term indicate that aging is accompanied by a low degree of chronic inflammatory, an up-regulation of inflammatory response and that inflammatory changes are common to many age-related diseases. In this review special attention was dedicated to diseases related to age as atherosclerosis, cancer and Alzheimer disease. Despite the fact that in recent years many theories about ageing have been developed, we are still far from a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the ageing process.",[],Reviews on recent clinical trials,2011-01-19,"[{'lastname': 'Pizza', 'firstname': 'Vincenzo', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiopathology Unit, S.

218,21189317,Glia-induced reversible disruption of blood-brain barrier integrity and neuropathological response of the neurovascular unit.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the regulated interface that mediates selective transcellular transport of nutrients and essential components from the blood into the brain parenchyma. Many neurodegenerative diseases including stroke, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS dementia exhibit loss of BBB integrity. Despite the increasing body of evidence for the involvement of glia in maintaining the BBB, few studies have addressed glial/endothelial/extracellular matrix interactions. A chemically induced astrocyte lesion provides a noninvasive model to study reversible BBB dysfunction in vivo. Blood-brain barrier integrity was assessed with fluorescent dextran tracers (3-70 kDa) and magnetic resonance imaging, in parallel with confocal and electron microscopy imaging of the neurovascular unit. These studies demonstrated modified tight-junction protein expression with loss of vascular integrity. We propose that adherens junction proteins and extracellular matrix remodeling provide a temporary size-selective barrier, whereas astrocyte and microglia activation direct tight-junction proteins to paracellular domains and restore BBB integrity. Morphological comparisons were made with the area postrema, a circumventricular organ with a naturally porous BBB. Further studies into cellular mechanisms of glial/endothelial/extracellular matrix interactions may identify novel glial-based therapeutic targets and innovate therapies for modulating diseases in which gliosis and raised levels of pro-inflammatory mediators are central components.",[],Toxicologic pathology,2010-12-30,"[{'lastname': 'Willis', 'firstname': 'Colin L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine and Center for Excellence in the Neurosciences, University of New England, Biddeford, ME 04005, USA. cwillis1@une.edu'}]",,,,,10.1177/0192623310385830,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d87b2720>

220,21098983,Depression and Alzheimer's disease: is stress the initiating factor in a common neuropathological cascade?,"The existence of a high co-morbidity between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression has been known for a long time. More interesting though are recent studies indicating that depression and number of depressive episodes earlier in life is associated with increased risk of AD development. This suggests the existence of common neuropathological mechanisms behind depression and AD. Here we propose that the brain changes associated with depressive episodes that compromise the brain's ability to cope with stress may constitute risk factors for development of AD. Furthermore, in individuals with a genetic linkage to depression, there may be an increased vulnerability towards the initiation of a detrimental neurodegenerative cascade. The following review will deal with the various observations reported within the different neurobiological systems known to be involved and affected in depression, like serotonergic and cholinergic system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and brain derived neurotrophic factor, and discussed in relation to AD.",[],Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2010-11-26,"[{'lastname': 'Aznar', 'firstname': 'Susana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Integrated Molecular Imaging, Neurobiology Research Unit, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. saznar@nru.dk'}, {'lastname': 'Knudsen', 'firstname': 'Gitte M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-2010-100390,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d89bc7c0>
221,20858975,HPA axis dysregulation associated to apolipoprotein E4 genotype in Alzheimer's disease.,"The present work investigated the involvement of cortisol and its receptors, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cortisol was measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), progressive MCI evolving to AD, and AD. CSF cortisol levels do not seem to have a prognostic value, as increases in cortisol levels were found only in AD patients. GR expression was decreased while MR expression was increased in the frontal cortex of AD. When considering degeneration (ratio to synaptophysin and the post-synaptic marker PSD95), GR expression was similar between controls and AD, suggesting that GR loss was due to synaptic degeneration in AD. Increases in cortisol levels and MR expression were associated to an apolipoprotein E4 genotype. Cognitive status was negatively associated to CSF cortisol. In apolipoprotein E4 carriers, MR but not GR expression, negatively correlated to Mini-Mental Status Examination score and positively correlated to frontal cortex amyloid-β levels.

222,20854243,Iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Australia: time to amend infection control measures for pituitary hormone recipients?,"From 1967, the Australian Human Pituitary Hormone Program offered treatment for short stature and infertility using human cadaver-acquired pituitary hormones (human growth hormone [hGH] and human pituitary gonadotrophin [hPG]). The program was suspended in 1985 when a growth-hormone recipient in the United States developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), an incurable and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Since this time, recipients have lived with the significant anxiety that they have an elevated risk of developing CJD. Furthermore, additional CJD infection control measures are required when recipients undergo some types of surgery. As it is 20 years since the last Australian pituitary hormone recipient developed CJD, we evaluated the risk for Australian recipients of developing iatrogenic CJD, and compared Australian data with data from New Zealand and selected other countries who had pituitary hormone programs. Our evaluation indicates that pituitary hormone recipients in Australia have the lowest risk of developing iatrogenic CJD, and that Australia is the only country not to have experienced ongoing CJD-related deaths. Thus, we believe that: in the Australian hGH recipient cohort, the risk of developing CJD is sufficiently low for this cohort to no longer require additional infection control measures in the health care setting; and in the Australian hPG recipient cohort, if another 5 years elapses with no further occurrence of CJD in this group, the hPG recipient cohort could also be considered as not requiring additional infection control measures in the health care setting. These recommendations should not be misunderstood as implying that there is no ongoing risk, but that the risk is acceptably low and generally in keeping with guidelines that stratify the risk.",[],The Medical journal of Australia,2010-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Boyd', 'firstname': 'Alison', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. aboyd@unimelb.edu.au'}, {'lastname': 'Klug', 'firstname': 'Genevieve M J A', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schonberger', 'firstname': 'Lawrence B', 'initials': 'LB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McGlade', 'firstname': 'Amelia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brandel', 'firstname': 'Jean-Philippe', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Masters', 'firstname': 'Colin L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Collins', 'firstname': 'Steven J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.5694/j.1326-5377.2010.tb03951.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d89d83b0>
223,20840280,Estrogen therapy and Alzheimer's dementia.,"Previous studies in postmenopausal women have reported that estrogen treatment (ET) modulates the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has recently been hypothesized that there may be a ""critical period"" around the time of menopause during which the prescription of ET may reduce the risk of developing AD in later life. This effect may be most significant in women under 49 years old. Furthermore, prescription of ET after this point may have a neutral or negative effect, particularly when initiated in women over 60-65 years old. In this paper, we review recent studies that use in vivo techniques to analyze the neurobiological mechanisms that might underpin estrogen's effects on the brain postmenopause. Consistent with the ""critical period"" hypothesis, these studies suggest that the positive effects of estrogen are most robust in young women and in older women who had initiated ET around the time of menopause.",[],Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2010-09-16,"[{'lastname': 'Craig', 'firstname': 'Michael C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Female Health and Neurodevelopment, Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom. michael.c.craig@kcl.ac.uk'}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'D G M', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05673.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d89cd270>

HPA axis functioning was measured through salivary cortisol in the day curve, the cortisol awakening response (CAR), the area under the curve (AUC), the morning rise, and the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Only the CAR was statistically different between the three groups, being explained by higher cortisol concentrations at 45 and 60 min post-awakening for presymptomatic mutation carriers compared to both symptomatic mutation carriers and controls.

225,20708081,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis adaptation processes in a depressive-like state induced by chronic restraint stress.,"Depression is potentially life-threatening. The most important neuroendocrine abnormality in this disorder is hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis hyperactivity. Recent findings suggest that all depression treatments may boost the neurotrophin production especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Moreover, BDNF is highly involved in the regulation of HPA axis activity. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of chronic stress (restraint 3h/day for 3 weeks) on animal behavior and HPA axis activity in parallel with hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary BDNF levels. Chronic stress induced changes in anxiety (light/dark box test) and anhedonic states (sucrose preference test) and in depressive-like behavior (forced swimming test); general locomotor activity and body temperature were modified and animal body weight gain was reduced by 17%. HPA axis activity was highly modified by chronic stress, since basal levels of mRNA and peptide hypothalamic contents in CRH and AVP and plasma concentrations in ACTH and corticosterone were significantly increased. The HPA axis response to novel acute stress was also modified in chronically stressed rats, suggesting adaptive mechanisms. Basal BDNF contents were increased in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary in chronically stressed rats and the BDNF response to novel acute stress was also modified. This multiparametric study showed that chronic restraint stress induced a depressive-like state that was sustained by mechanisms associated with BDNF regulation.",[],Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2010-08-17,"[{'lastname': 'Naert', 'firstname': 'Gaelle', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U710, F-34095 Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ixart', 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maurice', 'firstname': 'Tangui', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tapia-Arancibia', 'firstname': 'Lucia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Givalois', 'firstname': 'Laurent', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

19559073",Mitotic figures in the median eminence of the hypothalamus.,"The median eminence of the hypothalamus is part of the avenue by which neurosecreted hormones from the hypothalamic nuclei reach the pars nervosa (neural lobe) of the pituitary and eventually the bloodstream. Lithium treatment and osmotic stress increases the transport of neurosecretory hormones to the pituitary in the adult rat. Specialized astrocytes termed pituicytes in the pars nervosa of the pituitary participate in the secretory process and also develop considerable mitotic activity. The present work reveals similar mitotic figures in cells within the median eminence following 3 days of lithium treatment. The location and appearance of these mitoses add to the evidence that pituicytes are present in the median eminence. Moreover, mitoses occur within the ependymal (tanycyte) layer of the median eminence. Thus, the present results suggest that the tanycyte layer may contain pituicytes, indicating that the hypothalamus possesses specialized cells for modulating neurosecretion in response to osmotic challenges.",[],Neurochemical research,2010-08-04,"[{'lastname': 'Levine', 'firstname': 'Seymour', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, Orangeburg, NY 10962, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saltzman', 'firstname': 'Arthur', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ginsberg', 'firstname': 'Stephen D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s11064-010-0237-9,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d89abb30>
227,20600637,Granins as disease-biomarkers: translational potential for psychiatric and neurological disorders.,"The identification of biomarkers represents a fundamental medical advance that can lead to an improved understanding of disease pathogenesis, and holds the potential to define surrogate diagnostic and prognostic endpoints. Because of the inherent difficulties in assessing brain function in patients and objectively identifying neurological and cognitive/emotional symptoms, future application of biomarkers to neurological and psychiatric disorders is extremely desirable. This article discusses the biomarker potential of the granin family, a group of acidic proteins present in the secretory granules of a wide variety of endocrine, neuronal and neuroendocrine cells: chromogranin A (CgA), CgB, Secretogranin II (SgII), SgIII, HISL-19 antigen, 7B2, NESP55, VGF and ProSAAS. Their relative abundance, functional significance, and secretion into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, and the general circulation have made granins tractable targets as biomarkers for many diseases of neuronal and endocrine origin, recently impacting diagnosis of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and schizophrenia. Although research has not yet validated the clinical utility of granins as surrogate endpoints for the progression or treatment of neurological or psychiatric disease, a growing body of experimental evidence indicates that the use of granins as biomarkers might be of great potential clinical interest. Advances that further elucidate the mechanism(s) of action of granins, coupled with improvements in biomarker technology and direct clinical application, should increase the translational effectiveness of this family of proteins in disease diagnosis and drug discovery.",[],Neuroscience,2010-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Bartolomucci', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Evolutionary and Functional Biology, University of Parma, 43124 Parma, Italy. alessandro.bartolomucci@unipr.it'}, {'lastname': 'Pasinetti', 'firstname': 'G M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Salton', 'firstname': 'S R J', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright 2010 IBRO.

228,20594177,Hypothalamic and neuroendocrine changes in Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is neither a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder without satisfactory treatments nor a cure. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. The clinical symptoms involve motor-, cognitive- and psychiatric disturbances. Recent studies have shown that non-motor symptoms and signs, such as mood changes, sleep disturbances and metabolic alterations often occur before the onset of overt motor impairments. The hypothalamus is one of the main regulators of emotion, sleep and metabolism, and it is therefore possible that dysfunction of the hypothalamus and neuroendocrine circuits may, at least partly, be responsible for these non-motor symptoms in HD. Several hypothalamic and neuroendocrine changes have now been identified in clinical HD as well as in rodent models of the disease. These changes could be important both in the pathogenesis of HD, constitute biomarkers to track disease progression as well as to provide novel therapeutic targets for this devastating disease.

229,20588235,Neuroendocrine evidence of normal hypothalamus-pituitary dopaminergic function in Huntington's disease.,"In addition to neuronal loss in striatum and cerebral cortex that characterizes Huntington's disease (HD), hypothalamic atrophy has also been found only in certain areas, probably not including dopaminergic functions.
We assessed the reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary dopaminergic system by measuring the acute prolactin (PRL) responses to 5 mg i.m. haloperidol in male and female HD patients and in female subjects with expanded CAG repeats in the Huntington gene before disease onset, as well as in a group of healthy males.
The responses of the male patients were similar to those of a group of male healthy volunteers. Females gave higher PRL responses, with no differences in the response patterns of female patients and females at risk for HD. PRL elevations were not related to severity of illness, or to presence of dementia, depression, or psychotic features.
The results implicate a normal dopaminergic input from hypothalamus to pituitary and preserved pituitary dopamine receptors, indicating that hypothalamic atrophy in HD does not affect mechanisms involved in PRL secretion by haloperidol.",[],Neuro endocrinology letters,2010-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Markianos', 'firstname': 'Manolis', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Athens University Medical School, Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece. markian@otenet.gr'}, {'lastname': 'Panas', 'firstname': 'Marios', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kalfakis', 'firstname': 'Nikos', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hatzimanolis', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vassilopoulos', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The responses of the male patients were similar to those of a group of male healthy volunteers.

14962073",Diabetes type II: a risk factor for depression-Parkinson-Alzheimer?,"There is ample evidence that impairments in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are of etiopathobiochemical importance in a subgroup of patients with ""depression"", causing hypercortisolaemia as major metabolic effect. Chronic hypercortisolaemia causes insulin resistance. Therefore, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies demonstrate an association of ""depression"" with diabetes type II and vice versa. Chronic stress and hypercortisolaemia are conditions, which have been suggested to be causal for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as brain insulin resistance is associated with β-Amyloid-accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of tau-protein. Depression is one of the significant symptomatology preceding AD. It is however, not known whether ""depression"" associated with hypercortisolaemia is the subgroup at risk for AD. In contrast to a subgroup of ""depression"" and to AD, in Parkinson's disease (PD) there is only weak evidence for an association with diabetes type II and insulin resistance. As ""depression"" is preceding PD in up to half of such patients, it remains to be elucidated whether this is a subgroup of depressed patients, which is not associated with disturbances of the HPA axis and hypercortisolaemia. Improved clinical and biochemical/molecular knowledge about ""depression"" associated with AD and PD in comparison to ""pure"" depression might lead to improved therapeutic strategies and even drug development focusing subtypes of ""depression"".",[],Neurotoxicity research,2010-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Riederer', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Neurochemistry, Clinic and Policlinic for Psychiatry, Psychosomatic and Psychotherapy, National Parkinson Foundation Centre of Excellence Laboratories, University of Würzburg, Füchsleinstr. 15, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bartl', 'firstname': 'Jasmin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Laux', 'firstname': 'Gerd', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grünblatt', 'firstname': 'Edna', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s12640-010-9203-1,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d8984db0>
231,20472147,Corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin in depression focus on the human postmortem hypothalamus.,"The neuropeptides corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of depression. The close correlation between the etiology of depression and dysregulation of the stress responses is based upon a hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus are the motor of the HPA-axis. Centrally released CRH, AVP, and increased levels of cortisol all contribute to the signs and symptoms of depression. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRH and AVP receptor genes are associated with the risk for depression. Activation of the HPA-axis is generally regarded to be the final common pathway of the pathogenesis of depression. Sex hormones are crucially involved in the regulation of CRH gene expression. The decreased activity of the biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as indicated by its lower AVP expression, is the basis for the disturbed rhythms in depression. Both similarities and differences are found in the activity changes in the CRH and AVP systems in depressive disorders and depression in Alzheimer's disease.",[],Vitamins and hormones,2010-05-18,"[{'lastname': 'Bao', 'firstname': 'Ai-Min', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurobiology, Institute of Neuroscience, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'Dick F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Chronic exposure to certain interlinked biochemical pathways that mediate stress-related depression may contribute to ""accelerated aging,"" cell damage, and certain comorbid medical illnesses. Biochemical mediators explored in this theoretical review include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., hyper- or hypoactivation of glucocorticoid receptors), neurosteroids, such as dehydroepiandrosterone and allopregnanolone, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, excitotoxicity, oxidative and inflammatory stress, and disturbances of the telomere/telomerase maintenance system.

Cross-sectional analyses within the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance (SMART)-Medea study, an ancillary study to the SMART-MR study on brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among patients with arterial disease. In 575 patients (mean age 62 +/- 9 years), diurnal cortisol rhythm was assessed with six saliva samples, collected at awakening; at 30, 45, and 60 min thereafter; and at 10 pm and 11 pm. A low dose of dexamethasone (.5 mg) was administered at 11 pm, and saliva was sampled the next morning at awakening. Volumetric measurements of the hippocampus were performed on a three-dimensional fast field echo T1-weighted scan with isotropic voxels.
Mean total relative hippocampal volume was 6.0 +/- .7 mL. Linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, vascular risk factors, and global brain atrophy showed that participants with higher evening levels and higher awakening levels after dexamethasone had smaller hippocampal volumes [B per SD (4.2) increase = -.09 mL; 95% confidence interval -.15 to -.03 mL and B per SD (2.5) increase = -.07 mL; 95% confidence interval -.13 to -.01 mL, respectively].

9722143","Gender-specific association of galanin polymorphisms with HPA-axis dysregulation, symptom severity, and antidepressant treatment response.","Galanin (GAL) is an estrogen-inducible neuropeptide, highly expressed in brain regions reported to be involved in regulation of mood and anxiety. GAL possibly has a direct modulatory effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis regulation. Recent data from pharmacological and genetic studies indicate a significant function of GAL in stress-related disorders. By using a tag SNP approach covering the locus encoding preprogalanin (PPGAL), earlier findings of female-specific associations of polymorphisms in this locus with panic disorder were expanded to a larger sample of 268 outpatients with anxiety disorders (ADs). Within a larger sample of 541 inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD), we then tested associations of one PPGAL tag SNP with specific depression symptom clusters and HPA-axis activity assessed by the combined dexamethasone-suppression/CRH-stimulation test both at inpatient admission and discharge (n=298). Gender specificity as well as dependence of the association on levels of circulating estrogens was analyzed. Genotyping revealed high linkage disequilibrium in the promoter area of the PPGAL gene, which includes several estrogen-response elements. Confirming earlier results, rs948854, tagging this promoter region, was associated with more severe anxiety pathology in female AD patients, but not in males. In premenopausal female MDD patients, the same allele of rs948854 was associated with more severe vegetative but not cognitive depressive symptoms at discharge and worse treatment response on antidepressant medication. Furthermore, this allele was associated with higher HPA-axis activity at admission. No significant case-control associations could be observed. However, because of power limitations of both patient samples, small effects cannot be excluded. The reported associations in independent samples of AD and MDD support an estrogen-dependent function of GAL in pathophysiology of anxiety and depression, affecting response to antidepressant treatment.",[],Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2010-03-20,"[{'lastname': 'Unschuld', 'firstname': 'Paul G', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, München, Germany. unschuld@mpipsykl.mpg.de'}, {'lastname': 'Ising', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roeske', 'firstname': 'Darina', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Erhardt', 'firstname': 'Angelika', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Specht', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kloiber', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Uhr', 'firstname': 'Manfred', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Müller-Myhsok', 'firstname': 'Bertram', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Holsboer', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Binder', 'firstname': 'Elisabeth B', 'initials': 'EB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.1038/npp.2010.30

236,20236235,Occlusion and brain function: mastication as a prevention of cognitive dysfunction.,"Research in animals and humans has shown that mastication maintains cognitive function in the hippocampus, a brain area important for learning and memory. Reduced mastication, an epidemiological risk factor for the development of dementia in humans, attenuates spatial memory and causes hippocampal neurons to deteriorate morphologically and functionally, especially in aged animals. Active mastication rescues the stress-attenuated hippocampal memory process in animals and attenuates the perception of stress in humans by suppressing endocrinological and autonomic stress responses. Active mastication further improves the performance of sustained cognitive tasks by increasing the activation of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, the brain regions that are essential for cognitive processing. Abnormal mastication caused by experimental occlusal disharmony in animals produces chronic stress, which in turn suppresses spatial learning ability. The negative correlation between mastication and corticosteroids has raised the hypothesis that the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by masticatory stimulation contributes, in part, to preserving cognitive functions associated with mastication. In the present review, we examine research pertaining to the mastication-induced amelioration of deficits in cognitive function, its possible relationship with the HPA axis, and the neuronal mechanisms that may be involved in this process in the hippocampus.",[],Journal of oral rehabilitation,2010-03-20,"[{'lastname': 'Ono', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Kanagawa Dental College, Yokosuka, Japan. yumie@kdcnet.ac.jp'}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kubo', 'firstname': 'K-ya', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Onozuka', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1365-2842.2010.02079.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9282db0>
237,20056462,The role of environmental light in sleep and health: effects of ocular aging and cataract surgery.,"Environmental illumination profoundly influences human health and well-being. Recently discovered photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) are primary mediators of numerous circadian, neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral responses. pRGCs provide lighting information to diverse nonvisual (non-image-forming) brain centers including the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) which serve as the body's master biological clock. The SCN exert functional control over circadian aspects of physiology. The timing and strength (amplitude) of SCN rhythmic signals are affected by light exposure. Light deficiency may attenuate SCN function and its control of physiological and hormonal rhythms which in turn can result in a cascade of adverse events. Inadequate pRGC photoreception cannot be perceived consciously, but may aggravate many common age-associated problems including insomnia, depression and impaired cognition. In this review we (1) summarize circadian physiology, emphasizing light's critical role as the most important geophysical timing cue in humans; (2) analyze evidence that typical residential lighting is insufficient for optimal pRGC requirements in youth and even more so with advancing age; (3) show how ocular aging and cataract surgery impact circadian photoreception; and (4) review some of the diverse morbidities associated with chronodisruption in general and those which may be caused by light deficiency in particular.",[],Sleep medicine reviews,2010-01-09,"[{'lastname': 'Turner', 'firstname': 'Patricia L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Kansas School of Medicine, 7400 State Line Road, Prairie Village, KS 66208-3444, USA. plturnermd@att.net'}, {'lastname': 'Van Someren', 'firstname': 'Eus J W', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mainster', 'firstname': 'Martin A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,(c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Depression is now seen to implicate a wide range of neurotransmitters, including dopamine and glutamate, and virtually the entire central nervous system. Emerging evidence is redefining depression as a chronic and systemic illness that may impair neuroendocrine function, biological rhythms and immune responses, and one which may lead to dementia if left untreated. Different research approaches, from molecular biology to clinical studies, have offered new insights into the physiological mechanisms involved as well as indications of how effective antidepressant therapies may develop in response to these. In addition to well-established methods, like monoamine reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioural therapy, these may include non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, prescription of physical exercise, somatic treatments and a whole new generation of antidepressant drugs endowed with original modes of action.

239,20021460,Estrogen receptor neurobiology and its potential for translation into broad spectrum therapeutics for CNS disorders.,"Estrogens are hormones that modulate a diverse array of effects during development and adulthood. The effects of estrogen are mediated by two estrogen receptor (ER) isotypes, ERalpha and ERbeta, which classically function as transcription factors to modulate specific target gene expression and in addition regulate a growing list of intracellular signaling cascades. These receptors share protein sequence homology and protein-motif organization but have distinct differences in their tissue distribution and binding affinities for their ligands. In the nervous system estrogen has been implicated to play a role in a number of processes which regulate synaptic plasticity including synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. The role for estrogen in a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases is also becoming very apparent. Estrogen is able to regulate processes and behaviours relevant for both Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia and to modulate neuroendocrine and inflammatory processes important in neuroinflammation, anxiety and depressive disorders as well as chronic pain. We will consider the rationale for estrogen-based therapies for diseases of the nervous system. In particular we will highlight the molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways most likely underlying the effects of estrogen in the CNS.",[],Current molecular pharmacology,2009-12-22,"[{'lastname': 'Hughes', 'firstname': 'Zoë A', 'initials': 'ZA', 'affiliation': 'Wyeth Research, Discovery Neuroscience, Princeton, New Jersey 08543, USA. hughesz@wyeth.com'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marquis', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Muniz', 'firstname': 'Luis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pangalos', 'firstname': 'Menelas N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ring', 'firstname': 'Robert H', 'initials': 'RH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Whiteside', 'firstname': 'Garth T', 'initials': 'GT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brandon', 'firstname': 'Nicholas J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.2174/1874467210902030215,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9262ea0>
240,20021365,Hormones in the mentally disturbed brain: steroids and peptides in the development and treatment of psychopathology.,"One of the more fascinating recent discoveries in neuroscience is the widespread influence of hormones on brain regions and functions underlying pathological behaviors. A story is unfolding that points to critical roles played by hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal (HPA) axes on a startling array of mental disorders, from depression to dementia. The influence of peptides and steroids does not end with hormones released from the two axes, however. It is now clear that the brain has adapted, ""highjacked"" is more descriptive, HPG and HPA hormones for uses unrelated to their original functions in reproduction and responses to stress. Findings of neuromodulatory effects of HPA and HPG hormones on monoamine, GABA, glutamate and opioid pathways and of hormone receptors and enzymes involved in hormone synthesis, particularly of steroids, in the hippocampus, amygdala and other subcortical brain regions provide the brain with multiple evolutionary means to adapt to new functions. The complexity of the metabolic cascade for the steroids also leaves open mechanisms by which endogenous errors and exogenous chemicals could be involved in the etiology of psychopathologies. The planned review will examine the recent literature for evidence of steroidal and peptidergic influences on basic biological functions and on mood disorders, anxiety and PTSD, schizophrenia, substance abuse and dementia. Emphasis will be placed on animal models, although findings with patient populations will be prominently included. Special attention will be paid to novel pathways by which the precursors and metabolites of sex steroids can influence psychopathologies. We also will speculate on promising treatments with hormone modulators that may be useful in mollifying the symptomology of the mental disorders.",[],Central nervous system agents in medicinal chemistry,2009-12-22,"[{'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'George Townsend', 'initials': 'GT', 'affiliation': 'University of Missouri St. Louis, 63121, USA. geot@UMSL.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Maloney', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dearborn', 'firstname': 'Joshua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Weiss', 'firstname': 'Juergen', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.2174/187152409789630398,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db8e99a0>

11102572","Adverse stress, hippocampal networks, and Alzheimer's disease.","Recent clinical data have implicated chronic adverse stress as a potential risk factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and data also suggest that normal, physiological stress responses may be impaired in AD. It is possible that pathology associated with AD causes aberrant responses to chronic stress, due to potential alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Recent study in rodent models of AD suggests that chronic adverse stress exacerbates the cognitive deficits and hippocampal pathology that are present in the AD brain. This review summarizes recent findings obtained in experimental AD models regarding the influence of chronic adverse stress on the underlying cellular and molecular disease processes including the potential role of glucocorticoids. Emerging findings suggest that both AD and chronic adverse stress affect hippocampal neural networks in a similar fashion. We describe alterations in hippocampal plasticity, which occur in both chronic stress and AD including dendritic remodeling, neurogenesis, and long-term potentiation. Finally, we outline potential roles for oxidative stress and neurotrophic factor signaling as the key determinants of the impact of chronic stress on the plasticity of neural networks and AD pathogenesis.",[],Neuromolecular medicine,2009-11-28,"[{'lastname': 'Rothman', 'firstname': 'Sarah M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neurosciences, National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA. sarah.rothman@nih.gov'}, {'lastname': 'Mattson', 'firstname': 'Mark P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s12017-009-8107-9,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db8f3310>
242,19906241,Glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms in major depression. Focus on glucocorticoid sensitivity and neurocognitive functioning.,"Previously, it has been suggested that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and, as a consequence, increased cortisol levels, is not only a state phenomenon, but may also be a trait phenomenon in mood disorders. Cortisol exerts its effects mainly by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, of particular interest in certain brain regions, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Several GR polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with altered sensitivity of the HPA axis. Recently, the GR polymorphisms BclI and ER22/23EK have been associated with unipolar depression in several studies. In addition, the ER22/23EK polymorphism seems to be associated with a decreased risk of dementia in healthy individuals. Also, during a depressive episode, carriers of this ER22/23EK variant demonstrated a tendency toward better cognition, as measured by divided attention tests. In this overview, currently known clinically relevant GR and MR polymorphisms are discussed in relation to mood disorders (both unipolar depression and bipolar disorder) and cognitive function.",[],Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2009-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Spijker', 'firstname': 'Anne T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'PsyQ, The Hague, the Netherlands. a.spijker@psyq.nl'}, {'lastname': 'van Rossum', 'firstname': 'Elisabeth F C', 'initials': 'EF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04985.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbc40c20>
243,19816052,Neuroendocrine and immunological correlates of chronic stress in 'strictly healthy' populations.,"Chronic stress has been associated with detrimental or maladaptive neuroendocrine and immunological changes.
We assessed the neuroendocrine and immunological correlates of a realistic chronic stress experienced by strictly healthy caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients and age-matched controls.
We screened 330 caregivers and 206 non-caregivers according to the 'strictly healthy' conditions established by the SENIEUR protocol. Forty-one strictly healthy caregivers (60.56 +/- 16.56 years) and 33 non-stressed controls (60.27 +/- 14.11 years) were selected for this study. Salivary cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were assessed at multiple points by radioimmunoassay. Peripheral T cell proliferation and cellular sensitivity to glucocorticoids (corticosterone and dexamethasone, DEX) were evaluated by colorimetric assays. We also examined the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to the administration of a low-dose DEX in vivo.
The caregivers were significantly more stressed, anxious and depressed than non-caregivers (all p < 0.0001), in contrast to similar cortisol levels. Caregivers had reduced DHEAS levels (-32%, p < 0.0001), an increased cortisol/DHEAS ratio (39.7%, p < 0.0001) and impaired HPA axis response to DEX intake. Caregivers had a higher T cell proliferation (p < 0.0001) and increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids in vitro (p < 0.01) as compared to non-stressed controls.

15975730",A prospective study of diurnal cortisol and cognitive function in community-dwelling elderly people.,"Elevated cortisol levels due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response have been associated with cognitive impairment. However, the causal relationship between stress and subsequent cognitive impairment remains unclear, notably because of the small number of gender-stratified prospective studies.
Salivary cortisol secretion was evaluated in 197 non-depressed community-dwelling elderly people at three time points on the day of hospital attendance for a clinical examination and again on the following day at home, in a distinct environmental context. Cognitive performance was evaluated at baseline and at 2- and 4-year follow-up.
Cross-sectional logistic analyses adjusted for age and education indicated that men with high morning cortisol at the hospital had higher risk of low cognitive performance in verbal fluency [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, p=0.05] and visuospatial performance (OR 5.1, p=0.03). Impairment in verbal fluency was observed in women with moderate high morning cortisol (OR 3.6, p=0.05) or moderate slow diurnal rhythm (OR 3.7, p=0.04). In longitudinal analyses, slow diurnal rhythm (flatter slope) was associated with decline over 4 years in visuospatial performance (OR 7.7, p=0.03) and visual memory (OR 4.1, p=0.03) in men, and in verbal fluency (OR 6.0, p=0.01) in women. High morning cortisol was associated with decline in visual memory in women (OR 5.1, p=0.06).
HPA axis dysregulation seems to be associated with low cognitive performance in the elderly. Slower cortisol elimination rates could predict cognitive decline affecting principally non-verbal functioning in men and verbal functioning in women. The effects are independent of environmental context, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or psychopathology. Interventions blocking this pathway may provide new therapeutic options to prevent cognitive decline.",[],Psychological medicine,2009-10-10,"[{'lastname': 'Beluche', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Inserm, U888, University of Montpellier 1, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Carrière', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ritchie', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ancelin', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}]","Salivary cortisol secretion was evaluated in 197 non-depressed community-dwelling elderly people at three time points on the day of hospital attendance for a clinical examination and again on the following day at home, in a distinct environmental context.

245,19666212,A potential role for crystallization inhibitors in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Melatonin is a hormone synthesized from the neurotransmitter serotonin and is found mainly in the pineal gland. Melatonin has been suggested to have several properties, acting both as an antioxidant and a neuroprotective agent. Melatonin synthesis decreases with age in all humans, but this decline is more pronounced in Alzheimer's patients. In fact, melatonin inhibits the formation of beta-amyloid protein. The mechanism responsible for this decline has not been fully elucidated, although it is known that the human pineal gland calcifies with age. Such calcification necessarily implies the existence of a tissue injury that, if not reabsorbed by the immune system, will act as heterogeneous nucleant for hydroxyapatite and will induce calcification. For this reason, it is hypothesized that a lack of inhibitors of calcium salt crystallization, such as pyrophosphate and phytate, will favor calcification. Therefore, the absence of crystallization inhibitors may be a risk factor for development of Alzheimer's disease, and this hypothesis should be evaluated.",[],Medical hypotheses,2009-08-12,"[{'lastname': 'Grases', 'firstname': 'Fèlix', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Renal Lithiasis Research, University Institute of Health Sciences Research (IUNICS), University of Balearic Islands, Spain. fgrases@uib.es'}, {'lastname': 'Costa-Bauzà', 'firstname': 'Antònia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Prieto', 'firstname': 'Rafael M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.mehy.2009.07.029,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9f4e0e0>

17015435",Restricted growth and insulin-like growth factor-1 deficiency in mice lacking presenilin-1 in the neural crest cell lineage.,"Presenilin-1 (PS1) is a transmembrane protein that is in many cases responsible for the development of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. PS1 is essential for neurogenesis, somitogenesis, angiogenesis, and cardiac morphogenesis. We report here that PS1 is also required for maturation and/or maintenance of the pituitary gland. We generated PS1-conditional knockout (PS1-cKO) mice by crossing floxed PS1 and Wnt1-cre mice, in which PS1 was lacking in the neural crest-derived cell lineage. Although the PS1-cKO mice exhibited no obvious phenotypic abnormalities for several days after birth, reduced body weight in the mutant was evident by the age of 3-5 weeks. Pituitary weight and serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 level were also reduced in the mutant. Histologic analysis revealed severe atrophy of the cytosol in the anterior and intermediate pituitary lobes of the mutant. Immunohistochemistry did not reveal clear differences in the expression levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, or prolactin in the mutant pituitary. In contrast, growth hormone expression levels were reduced in the anterior lobe of the mutant. PS1 was defective in the posterior lobe, but not the anterior or intermediate lobes, in the mutant pituitary. These findings suggest that PS1 indirectly mediates the development and/or maintenance of the anterior and intermediate lobes in the pituitary gland via actions in other regions, such as the posterior lobe.",[],International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,2009-08-12,"[{'lastname': 'Nakajima', 'firstname': 'Mitsunari', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Pharmacology, School of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Matsuyama University, 4-2 Bunkyo-cho, Matsuyama 790-8578, Ehime, Japan. mnakajim@cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Sono', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Okuyama', 'firstname': 'Satoshi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Jie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Furukawa', 'firstname': 'Yoshiko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2009.08.003,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9f36720>
247,19521064,Huntington's disease - new perspectives based on neuroendocrine changes in rodent models.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. Although it is characterized by progressive motor impairments, cognitive changes and psychiatric disturbances are major components of the disease. In addition, recent studies have shown that other non-motor symptoms such as alterations in sleep pattern, disruption of the circadian rhythm and increased energy metabolism are common and occur early. Emerging evidence suggests that the latter symptoms are likely results of disturbed functions of the hypothalamus and neuroendocrine circuits, which are known to be central in the regulation of emotion, sleep and metabolism. Whereas clinical data are essential to define key pathological features of HD, animal models that can recapitulate the neurobiological and behavioral features of the disorder are critical tools to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Recent studies employing different HD rodent models have been instrumental in identifying a number of neuroendocrine alterations as well as in highlighting novel potential disease pathways. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge derived from neuroendocrine studies in rodent models of HD in light of clinical relevance and points to future implications for this emerging field.",[],Neuro-degenerative diseases,2009-06-13,"[{'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Asa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. asa.petersen@med.lu.se'}, {'lastname': 'Hult', 'firstname': 'Sofia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kirik', 'firstname': 'Deniz', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1159/000225377,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9f2b400>

16300445",Modifiers of cognitive function and brain structure in middle-aged and elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Cognitive deficits and hippocampal atrophy, features that are shared with aging and dementia, have been described in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is associated with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis abnormalities and inflammation, all of which have been shown to negatively impact the brain. However, since most reports in T2DM focused on glycemic control, the relative contribution of these modifying factors to the impairments observed in T2DM remains unclear. We contrasted 41 middle-aged dementia-free volunteers with T2DM (on average 7 years since diagnosis) with 47 age-, education-, and gender-matched non-insulin resistant controls on cognition and brain volumes. HPA axis activity and other modifiers that accompany T2DM were assessed to determine their impact on brain and cognition. Individuals with T2DM had specific verbal declarative memory deficits, reduced hippocampal and prefrontal volumes, and impaired HPA axis feedback control. Diminished cortisol suppression after dexamethasone and dyslipidemia were associated with decreased cognitive performance, whereas obesity was negatively related to hippocampal volume. Moreover, prefrontal volume was influenced by worse glycemic control. Thus, obesity and altered cortisol levels may contribute to the impact of T2DM on the hippocampal formation, resulting in decreased verbal declarative memory performance.",[],Brain research,2009-05-26,"[{'lastname': 'Bruehl', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wolf', 'firstname': 'Oliver T', 'initials': 'OT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sweat', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tirsi', 'firstname': 'Aziz', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Richardson', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Convit', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.brainres.2009.05.032,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db6915e0>
249,19422401,The role of metabolic derangements and glucocorticoid excess in the aetiology of cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes. Implications for future therapeutic strategies.,"Dementia is becoming increasingly common in western societies and carries with it a substantial clinical, social and economic burden. It is now well established that type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia and it is likely that this association has a multifactorial aetiology. There is a relative paucity of data on interventions to improve cognitive function in people with type 2 diabetes. Two small randomized controlled trials have suggested that better glycaemic control, over a relatively short time period, can improve or prevent decline in cognitive function. There is also increasing interest in the link between intracerebral insulin and cognitive impairment. Several studies have suggested that relative and/or absolute deficiency of insulin may occur in Alzheimer's dementia and, although one small randomized trial was essentially negative, randomized trials are currently underway to investigate the impact of thiazolidinediones on cognitive function in dementia. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also activated in people with type 2 diabetes and there are data linking increased cortisol concentrations with cognitive impairment. Inhibition of the 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme, which generates cortisol from inactive cortisone in many tissues including the brain, is an attractive therapeutic target to enhance cognition. Large-scale epidemiological and intervention studies are now underway, which should enhance our understanding and management of cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes.",[],"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2009-05-09,"[{'lastname': 'Strachan', 'firstname': 'Mark W J', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Metabolic Unit, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK. mark.strachan@luht.scot.nhs.uk'}, {'lastname': 'Reynolds', 'firstname': 'Rebecca M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Frier', 'firstname': 'Brian M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mitchell', 'firstname': 'Rory J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Price', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00963.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db693b30>
250,19381858,A metabolic and functional overview of brain aging linked to neurological disorders.,"Close correlations have recently been shown among the late onset complications encountered in diabetes and aging linked to neurobiological disorders. Aging in females and males is considered as the end of natural protection against age related diseases like osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, dementia, cognitive dysfunction and hypernatremia. Beside the sex hormones other hormonal changes are also known to occur during aging and many common problems encountered in the aging process can be related to neuroendocrine phenomena. Diabetes mellitus is associated with moderate cognitive deficits and neurophysiologic and structural changes in the brain, a condition that may be referred to as diabetes encephalopathy; diabetes increases the risk of dementia especially in the elderly. The current view is that the diabetic brain features many symptoms that are best described as accelerated brain aging. This review presents and compares biochemical, physiological, electrophysiological, molecular, and pathological data from neuronal tissue of aging and hormone treated control and diabetic animals to arrive at the similarities among the two naturally occuring physiological conditions. Animal models can make a substantial contribution to understanding of the pathogenesis, which share many features with mechanism underlying brain aging. By studying the pathogenesis, targets for pharmacology can be identified, finally leading to delay or prevention of these complications. Antiaging strategies using hormone therapy, chemical and herbal compounds were carried out for reversal of aging effects. Neuronal markers have been presented in this review and similarities in changes were seen among the aging, diabetes and hormone treated (estrogen, DHEA and insulin) brains from these animals. A close correlation was observed in parameters like oxidative stress, enzyme changes, and pathological changes like lipofuscin accumulation in aging and diabetic brain.",[],Biogerontology,2009-04-22,"[{'lastname': 'Baquer', 'firstname': 'Najma Z', 'initials': 'NZ', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. nzbaquer@gmail.com'}, {'lastname': 'Taha', 'firstname': 'Asia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Pardeep', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McLean', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cowsik', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kale', 'firstname': 'R K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Deepak', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s10522-009-9226-2,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc27d5e0>

9365063",Neuroendocrine disturbances in Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a severe inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in addition to neurological impairment, by weight loss suggesting endocrine disturbances. The aims of this study were to look for neuroendocrine disturbances in patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and to determine the relationship with weight loss seen in HD METHODS AND FINDING: We compared plasma levels of hormones from the five pituitary axes in 219 patients with genetically documented HD and in 71 sex- and age-matched controls. Relationships between hormone levels and disease severity, including weight-loss severity, were evaluated. Growth hormone (GH) and standard deviation score of insulin-like growth factor 1 (SDS IGF-1) were significantly higher in patients than in controls (0.25 (0.01-5.89) vs. 0.15 (0.005-4.89) ng/ml, p = 0.013 and 0.16+/-1.02 vs. 0.06+/-0.91, p = 0.039; respectively). Cortisol was higher (p = 0.002) in patients (399.14+/-160.5 nmol/L vs. 279.8+/-130.1 nmol/L), whereas no differences were found for other hormone axes. In patients, elevations in GH and IGF-1 and decreases in thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine and testosterone (in men) were associated with severity of impairments (Independence scale, Functional score, Total Functional Capacity, Total Motor score, Behavioral score). Only GH was independently associated with body mass index (beta = -0.26, p = 0.001).

252,19250669,Expression of orexin A and its receptor 1 in the choroid plexuses from buffalo brain.,"The hypothalamic peptide orexin A, deriving from the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor molecule prepro-orexin, has a wide range of physiological effects including the regulation of feeding behaviour, neuroendocrine functions, sleep-wake cycle, and energy homeostasis. Lowered excretion of orexin A into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a pathological role in animal and human narcolepsy. Altered levels of orexin A into the CSF have been also found in numerous disorders of the central nervous system, including Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, dementia, and depressive disorders. While the localization of orexin A and its receptor 1, OX(1), has been elicited in many regions of the mammalian brain and in peripheral organs, there are no information on the expression of the neuropeptide and its receptor 1 in the choroid plexuses (CPs) producing the CSF. In this study, we investigated the expression of orexin A and OX(1) in the CPs from the brain of an adult mammalian species, Bubalis bubalis, by immunogold-labelling in scanning electron microscopy. Both orexin A and OX(1) immuno-reactivity appeared to be widely distributed on the surface of choroid epithelium. Interestingly, a marked orexin A labelling was detected in the areas surrounding the CP blood capillaries. The expression of prepro-orexin and OX(1) mRNA transcripts of 200 and 300 bp, respectively, was assessed in the CPs by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, while Western blotting analysis confirmed the presence of these two proteins in the tissue. Our findings provide the first evidence for orexin A and OX(1) expression in the CPs from mammalian brain, and suggest that the levels of orexin A into the CSF are probably regulated by CP activity.",[],Neuropeptides,2009-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Tafuri', 'firstname': 'Simona', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Structures, Functions and Technologies, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pavone', 'firstname': 'Luigi M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mastellone', 'firstname': 'Vincenzo', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Spina', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Avallone', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vittoria', 'firstname': 'Alfredo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Staiano', 'firstname': 'Norma', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Scala', 'firstname': 'Gaetano', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.npep.2009.01.003,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df387130>

14511168",Current treatments for sleep disturbances in individuals with dementia.,"Sleep disturbances are widespread among older adults. Degenerative neurologic disorders that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, exacerbate age-related changes in sleep, as do many common comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions. Medications used to treat chronic illness and insomnia have many side effects that can further disrupt sleep and place patients at risk for injury. This article reviews the neurophysiology of sleep in normal aging and sleep changes associated with common dementia subtypes and comorbid conditions. Current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic evidence-based treatment options are discussed, including the use of light therapy, increased physical and social activity, and multicomponent cognitive-behavioral interventions for improving sleep in institutionalized and community-dwelling adults with dementia.",[],Current psychiatry reports,2009-02-04,"[{'lastname': 'Deschenes', 'firstname': 'Cynthia L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McCurry', 'firstname': 'Susan M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s11920-009-0004-2,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d91b4720>
254,19174491,Increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction could contribute to a number of HD signs and symptoms; however, no data are available on cortisol diurnal variations and secretory dynamics in HD patients.
The aim of the study was to perform a detailed analysis of HPA axis function in HD patients in relation to clinical signs and symptoms.
Twenty-four-hour cortisol secretion was studied in eight early-stage, medication-free HD patients and eight age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls in a clinical research laboratory. Cortisol levels were measured every 10 min.
Multiparameter autodeconvolution and cosinor regression were applied to quantify basal, pulsatile, and total cortisol secretion rates as well as diurnal variations in cortisol levels.
Total cortisol secretion rate and the amplitude of the diurnal cortisol profile were both significantly higher in HD patients compared with controls (3490 +/- 320 vs. 2500 +/- 220 nmol/liter/24 h, P = 0.023; and 111 +/- 14 vs. 64 +/- 8 nmol/liter, P = 0.012, respectively). Cortisol concentrations in patients were particularly increased in the morning and early afternoon period. In HD patients, mean 24-h cortisol levels significantly correlated with total motor score, total functional capacity, as well as body mass index.
HPA axis hyperactivity is an early feature of HD and is likely to result from a disturbed central glucocorticoid feedback due to hypothalamic pathology.

The results indicate that several aspects of the impairment of the neuroimmunoendocrine network that occurs with aging are more evident in the 3xTg-AD mice, especially in males. This supports the hypothesis of a premature immunosenescence as a pathogenically relevant factor in AD which was found to be enhanced in the 3xTg-AD males, suggesting that this could also be responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality of these subjects. Therefore, future research on strategies that could improve the immune system and the other regulatory systems, such as the nervous and the endocrine system, as well as their communication, could have preventive and/or therapeutical effects on that disease.

259,18672097,Role of neuroendocrine pathways in cognitive decline during aging.,"The pineal and pituitary-adrenocortical secretions play an important role in adaptive responses of the organism acting as coordinating signals for both several biological rhythms and multiple neuroendocrine and metabolic functions. The more relevant neuroendocrine changes occurring with ageing affect the secretion of melatonin and of corticosteroids. These changes may be clearly appreciated by the study of their circadian rhythmicity. The circadian profile of plasma melatonin was clearly flattened in elderly subjects and even more in old individuals with dementia. Indeed, the impairment of melatonin signal occurring in aging was related either to age itself or to the cognitive performances of subjects. The biosynthetic dissociation between glucocorticoids and androgen secretion is responsible for the selective impairment of androgens, such as DHEA and DHEA-S, by comparison to cortisol. Due to the opposite effects of the two kinds of corticosteroids either in the periphery and in the CNS, the imbalance between glucocorticoids and androgens, well demonstrated by the evaluation of the cortisol/DHEA-S molar ratio, may be responsible for the occurrence in the CNS of a more neurotoxic steroidal milieu, already present in clinically healthy elderly subjects and especially in patients with dementia. The effects of that steroidal milieu are more prominent at the level of the hippocampal-limbic structure, involved both in the modulation of endocrine structures, such as the HPA axis, and in the control of cognitive, behavioral and affective functions.",[],Ageing research reviews,2008-08-02,"[{'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'Ettore', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia, Via Alboino 21, 27100 Pavia, Italy. ettofer33@tiscali.it'}, {'lastname': 'Magri', 'firstname': 'Flavia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.arr.2008.07.001,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db99da90>

In a case-control study, we assessed whether the cortisol response at awakening and diurnal cortisol would reflect these changes. AD patients, their caregivers, and healthy senior noncaregivers collected saliva within 5 minutes of waking, 30 minutes after waking, before lunch, 1 hour after lunch, and at 11 pm or when getting ready for bed. They also completed a Perceived Stress Scale. Total cortisol for the day after adjusting for antidepressant use revealed a group effect [F(2,39)=12.49, P<0.0001], with mild AD patients and caregivers having higher cortisol values. Unlike the noncaregivers (t=-1.15, df=14, P>0.27), both cortisol values of the AD caregivers (t=-2.96, df=16, P<0.03) and the AD patients' (t=-2.5, df=14, P<0.01) increased between awakening and 30 minutes afterward. There were also group differences at awakening [F(2,48)=4.6, P=0.012] adjusting for antidepressant use and 30 minutes after waking adjusting for antidepressant use and awakening cortisol [F(2,46)=4.7, P=0.014<0.02). AD patients (r=0.45, P=0.08) and caregivers (r=0.44, P=0.10) with higher cortisol values 30 minutes after waking also showed a trend toward higher perceived stress scores.

8893739",Ganglioglioma of the neurohypophysis.,"The normal infundibulum and neurohypophysis consist entirely of neuronal processes, the neuronal cell bodies of which lie within the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and supportive glial cells or pituicytes. The finding of neurons within the neurohypophysis is exceedingly rare, as are ganglion cell tumors at this site. In this paper, we report a ganglion cell tumor of the neurohypophysis found incidentally at autopsy. Despite chronic hypertension and the finding of some vasopressin immunoreactivity in lesional neurons, the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) was excluded on the basis of normal serum sodium levels.

262,18257652,Some assessments of the amygdala role in suprahypothalamic neuroendocrine regulation: a minireview.,"The amygdala is a complex structure playing primary role in the processing and memorizing of emotional reactions. The amygdalae send impulses to the hypothalamus for activation of the sympathetic nervous system, to the reticular nucleus for increasing reflexes, to the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve for facial expressions of fear, and to the ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus for activation of dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine release. The amygdala plays a key role in what has been called the ""general-purpose defense response control network"" and reacts in response to unpleasant sights, sensations, or smells. Anger, avoidance, and defensiveness are emotions activated largely by the amygdale. The amygdala is responsible for activating ancestral signs of distress such as ""tense-mouth"" and defensive postures such as crouching. Poor functioning of amygdala has also been associated with anxiety, autism, depression, narcolepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobias, frontotemporal dementia, and schizophrenia. Impairment of emotional event memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease also correlates with the intensity of amygdalar damage. All these events speak out for the importance to preserve the normal function of the amygdala which can only be achieved by constant deepening of our knowledge about this unique structure.",[],Endocrine regulations,2008-02-09,"[{'lastname': 'Talarovicova', 'firstname': 'Alzbeta', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Physiology and Ethology, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Krskova', 'firstname': 'Lucia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kiss', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9e31270>

Although the course of HD is also frequently complicated by unintended weight loss, sleep disturbances and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, the aetiology of these signs and symptoms remains largely unknown. In recent years, many novel findings from both animal and human studies have emerged that indicate considerable hypothalamic, endocrine and metabolic alterations in HD. However, a comprehensive overview of these findings is lacking and their precise clinical significance is far from clear. Therefore, in this review we attempt to put these recent developments in the field into perspective by integrating them with previous findings in a comprehensible manner, and by discussing their clinical relevance, with a special focus on body weight, sleep and autonomic functions in HD, which will also allow for the identification of future lines of research in this area.",[],Reviews in the neurosciences,2007-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Aziz', 'firstname': 'N A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.

265,18006138,Obesity in neurobiology.,"Obesity reflects an imbalance between energy uptake and expenditure that is mediated by behavior. Obesity is a growing epidemic and a major risk factor for neurobiological diseases like stroke, dementia, intracranial hypertension and sleep disorders. Conversely, obesity can also be induced by neurobiological disorders and drugs. The etiology of obesity is complex and includes biology, behavior and environment. Physicians are faced with the need to manage obesity while strategies for prevention and sustained weight reduction are limited. Present treatment options comprise lifestyle modification, diet, pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. Considerable headway has been made into elucidating the neurobiological underpinnings of obesogenic behavior. There is now a growing understanding of the metabolic, hormonal and behavioral circuitries that contribute to the complex and redundant system for energy balance.

16679342",The effect of curcumin on ethanol induced changes in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and pineal.,"(1) Circadian clocks have been localized to discrete sites within the nervous system of several organisms and in mammals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus. The SCN controls and regulates the production and discharge of melatonin (hormonal message of darkness) from the pineal gland via a multisynaptic efferent pathway. The nocturnal rise in melatonin production from serotonin results due to an increased activity of serotonin N-acetyl transferase (NAT). (2) The complex interaction between alcohol and biological clock need to be understood as alcoholism results in various clock linked neuronal disorders especially loss of memory and amnesia like state of consciousness, sleep disorders, insomnia, dementia etc. (3) Serotonin, 5-Hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) plays an important role in mediating alcohol's effects on the brain. Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on circadian system is a pre-requisite to help in treatment of alcohol induced neurological disorders. We, therefore, studied the effect of ethanol drinking and ethanol withdrawal on daily rhythms of serotonin and its metabolite, 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in SCN and Pineal of adult male Wistar rats maintained under light-dark (LD, 12:12) conditions. (4) Curcumin is well known for its protective properties such as antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, anti-viral and anti-infectious etc. Hence, we studied the effect of curcumin on ethanol induced changes on 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels and rhythms in SCN and Pineal. (5) Ethanol withdrawal could not restore either rhythmicity or phases or levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA. Curcumin administration resulted in partial restoration of daily 5-HT/5-HIAA ratio, with phase shifts in SCN and in Pineal. Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on circadian system and the role of herbal medication on alcohol withdrawal will help in treatment of alcohol induced neurological disorders.",[],Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2007-09-12,"[{'lastname': 'Jagota', 'firstname': 'Anita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, 500046, India. ajsl@uohyd.ernet.in'}, {'lastname': 'Reddy', 'firstname': 'M Y', 'initials': 'MY', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s10571-007-9203-8,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9da8270>

There is experimental and clinical evidence that the rise in the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids, which occurs in a chronically stressful situation and also in depression, contributes to the behavioural changes associated with depression. A defect in serotonergic function is associated with these hormonal and immune changes.

269,17692293,A promoter polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A gene is associated with the pineal MAOA activity in Alzheimer's disease patients.,"Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD). MAOA activity and gene expression have been found to be up-regulated in different brain areas of AD patients, including the pineal gland. Increased pineal MAOA activity might contribute to the reduced pineal melatonin production in AD. A promoter polymorphism of a variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) in the MAOA gene shows to affect MAOA transcriptional activity in vitro.
Here we examined in 63 aged controls and 44 AD patients the effects of the MAOA-VNTR on MAOA gene expression and activity in the pineal gland as endophenotypes, and on melatonin production.
AD patients carrying long MAOA-VNTR genotype (consisting of 3.5- or 4-repeat alleles) showed higher MAOA gene expression and activity than the short-genotyped (i.e., 3-repeat allele) AD patients. Moreover, the AD-related up-regulation of MAOA showed up only among long-genotype bearing subjects. There was no significant effect of the MAOA-VNTR on MAOA activity or gene expression in controls, or on melatonin production in both controls and AD patients.

Both experimental and clinical evidence support a beneficial effect of proline-rich polypeptides in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease. Experimental data have shown that proline-rich polypeptides isolated from bovine neurohypophisis possess neuroprotective and neuromodulatory properties in mice with aluminum neurotoxicosis or neuronal damage caused by venoms and toxins. Proline-rich polypeptides from ovine colostrums, so called Colostrinin, have been shown to produce cognitive improvement in an experimental model and in patients with Alzheimer disease. However, the precise mechanism underlying the neuroprotective action of proline-rich polypeptides is not very well established. Moreover, studies pointing at a neuroprotective effect of proline-rich polypeptides from bovine neurohypophisis in humans have not been reported thus far.

Disregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), indexed by basal cortisol levels, offers one explanation. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between wake time and cortisol slope in residents with behavioral symptoms. The study included 27 residents aged 71 to 84 years with dementia and behavioral symptoms. Using a within-subject longitudinal design, the researchers documented wake time and collected saliva samples for 4 consecutive days upon waking and at 30 min, 6 hr, and 12 hr after waking. Within-person cortisol slopes were categorized into zero-positive and negative slopes. The zero-positives (35%) exhibited an earlier wake time than the negatives (65%).

272,17524488,The stress system in depression and neurodegeneration: focus on the human hypothalamus.,"The stress response is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Activity of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) forms the basis of the activity of the HPA-axis. The CRH neurons induce adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) release from the pituitary, which subsequently causes cortisol release from the adrenal cortex. The CRH neurons co-express vasopressin (AVP) which potentiates the CRH effects. CRH neurons project not only to the median eminence but also into brain areas where they, e.g., regulate the adrenal innervation of the autonomic system and affect mood. The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system is also involved in stress response. It releases AVP from the PVN and the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and oxytocin (OXT) from the PVN via the neurohypophysis into the bloodstream. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the hypothalamic clock, is responsible for the rhythmic changes of the stress system. Both centrally released CRH and increased levels of cortisol contribute to the signs and symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression can be induced in experimental animals by intracerebroventricular injection of CRH. Depression is also a frequent side effect of glucocorticoid treatment and of the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. The AVP neurons in the hypothalamic PVN and SON are also activated in depression, which contributes to the increased release of ACTH from the pituitary. Increased levels of circulating AVP are also associated with the risk for suicide. The prevalence, incidence and morbidity risk for depression are higher in females than in males and fluctuations in sex hormone levels are considered to be involved in the etiology. About 40% of the activated CRH neurons in mood disorders co-express nuclear estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha in the PVN, while estrogen-responsive elements have been found in the CRH gene promoter region, and estrogens stimulate CRH production. An androgen-responsive element in the CRH gene promoter region initiates a suppressing effect on CRH expression. The decreased activity of the SCN is the basis for the disturbances of circadian and circannual fluctuations in mood, sleep and hormonal rhythms found in depression. Neuronal loss was also reported in the hippocampus of stressed or corticosteroid-treated rodents and primates. Because of the inhibitory control of the hippocampus on the HPA-axis, damage to this structure was expected to disinhibit the HPA-axis, and to cause a positive feedforward cascade of increasing glucocorticoid levels over time. This 'glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis' of stress and hippocampal damage was proposed to be causally involved in age-related accumulation of hippocampal damage in disorders like Alzheimer's disease and depression. However, in postmortem studies we could not find the presumed hippocampal damage of steroid overexposure in either depressed patients or in patients treated with synthetic steroids.",[],Brain research reviews,2007-05-26,"[{'lastname': 'Bao', 'firstname': 'A-M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Meibergdreef 47, 1105 BA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.m.bao@nin.knaw.nl'}, {'lastname': 'Meynen', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'D F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.04.005,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc6392c0>
273,17522448,Hypothesis: lifespan is regulated by chronomere DNA of the hypothalamus.,"As the basis for the lifelong clock and as a primary cause of aging, a process of shortening of hypothetical perichromosomal DNA structures termed chronomeres is proposed in the CNS. The lifelong clock is regulated by the shortening of chronomere DNA in postmitotic neurons of the hypothalamus. Shortening of these DNA sequences occurs in humans on a monthly basis through a lunasensory system and is controlled by release of growth hormone discharged from the anterior pituitary directly into the hypothalamus via local blood vessels. In adults, this process is under control of the pineal gland. It is further proposed that different forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by somatic and inherited deletions of chronomeres followed by a further abnormally accelerated decrease in their activity, resulting in failures of neurotrophic and neuroendocrinal activities and in various cellular imbalances. In this model, AD is considered as a segmental progeria caused by shortening of anomalous chronomeres that are partially deleted in early development. It is proposed that a calorie-restricted diet retards chronomere shortening due to a local deficit of growth hormone in the surroundings of hypothalamic cells, thus slowing the lifelong clock and delaying aging. Calorie restriction increases lifespan by preserving mitochondrial and other organismal functions owing to the decreased chronomere shortening.",[],Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2007-05-25,"[{'lastname': 'Olovnikov', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biochemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernyakhovskogo, 5-94, Moscow, 125319 Russia. olovnikov@dol.ru'}]",,,,,10.3233/jad-2007-11211,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc624c70>

The authors investigated 9-month-old Tg2576 mice with respect to behavioral and endocrinological (hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis activity) parameters. The locomotor activity test revealed that Tg2576 mice moved almost twice as much as controls. Tg2576 mice spent significantly more time visiting the open arms and performed more entries into these open arms than did controls. However, the amount of time that Tg2576 mice remained in each entry to the open arm was similar to that of controls, and the number of arm entries correlated positively to locomotor activity. In the forced swimming test, Tg2576 mice showed a significant decrease in immobility time, which correlated negatively to locomotor activity. Parameters of the HPA axis, such as plasma level of corticosterone, adrenal gland weight, and noradrenaline or adrenaline release, did not differ between controls and Tg2576 mice.

275,17437948,[Some neurological and psychiatric complications of the disorders of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system].,"Connection between the central nervous system and the endocrine system is extremely complex. The hypothalamus serves as a crucial centre for the integration and coordination of autonomic functions by neuronal and hormonal pathways. It plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of internal physiological conditions. It controls growth and reproduction, stress reactions, and determines rhythmicity, periodicity and timing of physiological processes. Beside its well-known functions, antidiuretic hormone has a role in social behavior as it enhances aggression via vasopressin receptor 1A. Oxitocin is affected in the formation of maternal behavior, and in other social interactions, like the pair bounding, as well as in analgesia and pain modulation. The corticotrop-releasing hormone acts as a neurotransmitter, it has a special role in stress-behavior, anxiety, and depression, and it blocks deep sleeping. Among the neurotransmitters and neuropeptids of the hypothalamus, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, cholecystokinin, neuropeptide-Y, Agouti-related protein, alpha-MSH and ghrelin have essential importance in the eating disorders. The levels of leptin and galanin determine whether formation of anabolic or catabolic neurotransmitters should take place. In the thermoregulation the central thermoreceptors play role, and suprachiasmatic nucleus is responsible for circadian rhythm, through ""timing genes"". The diseases of the hypothalamus cause most frequently bulimia or anorexia, hypersomnia, impotency, and attacks of anxiety. The most common expansive process of the hypothalamus is craniopharyngioma. The lack or diminution of vasopressin causes diabetes insipidus, while inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion induces Schwartz-Barter syndrome. Fröhlich-, Kleine-Levin- or Prader-Willi syndromes have characteristic neuropsychiatric features. The main psychiatric symptom of hypopituitarism is a combination of dementia and delirium.

In the YAC128 mouse model, testicular degeneration develops prior to 12 months of age, but at 12 months, there is no evidence for decreased testosterone levels or loss of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus. This suggests that testicular pathology results from a direct toxic effect of mutant huntingtin in the testis and is supported by the fact that huntingtin is highly expressed in the affected cell populations in the testis. Understanding the pathogenesis of HD in the testis may reveal common critical pathways which lead to degeneration in both the brain and testis.",[],Neurobiology of disease,2007-04-17,"[{'lastname': 'Van Raamsdonk', 'firstname': 'Jeremy M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Genetics, Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Child and Family Research Institute, University of British Columbia, 950 West 28th Ave., Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.'}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'Zoe', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Selva', 'firstname': 'David M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hamidizadeh', 'firstname': 'Reza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pearson', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Asa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Björkqvist', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Muir', 'firstname': 'Cameron', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mackenzie', 'firstname': 'Ian R', 'initials': 'IR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hammond', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey L', 'initials': 'GL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vogl', 'firstname': 'A Wayne', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hayden', 'firstname': 'Michael R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Leavitt', 'firstname': 'Blair R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.nbd.2007.01.006,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc6419a0>
277,17383938,Disturbance and strategies for reactivation of the circadian rhythm system in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Circadian rhythm disturbances, such as sleep disorders, are frequently seen in aging and are even more pronounced in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alterations in the biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the pineal gland during aging and AD are considered to be the biological basis for these circadian rhythm disturbances. Recently, our group found that pineal melatonin secretion and pineal clock gene oscillation were disrupted in AD patients, and surprisingly even in non-demented controls with the earliest signs of AD neuropathology (neuropathological Braak stages I-II), in contrast to non-demented controls without AD neuropathology. Furthermore, a functional disruption of the SCN was observed from the earliest AD stages onwards, as shown by decreased vasopressin mRNA, a clock-controlled major output of the SCN. The observed functional disconnection between the SCN and the pineal from the earliest AD stage onwards seems to account for the pineal clock gene and melatonin changes and underlies circadian rhythm disturbances in AD. This paper further discusses potential therapeutic strategies for reactivation of the circadian timing system, including melatonin and bright light therapy. As the presence of melatonin MT1 receptor in the SCN is extremely decreased in late AD patients, supplementary melatonin in the late AD stages may not lead to clear effects on circadian rhythm disorders.",[],Sleep medicine,2007-03-27,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Ying-Hui', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Meibergdreef 47, 1105 BA Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'Dick F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.sleep.2006.11.010,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc65e680>
278,17339397,Chemokines as modulators of neuroendocrine functions.,"Chemokines are small secreted proteins with chemoattractant properties for immune cells. Besides their role in the immune system, chemokines and their receptors may play important roles in the central nervous system. Neurodegenerative disorders that involve neuroinflammation such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV-associated dementia are commonly associated with local upregulation and release of chemokines. However, recent work has established that certain chemokines, constitutively expressed in the brain, exert functions in the brain that are distinct from inflammation. These chemokines regulate neuronal migration during brain development, modulate neuronal activity and play a role in various neurodegenerative diseases, pain and more recently in neuroendocrine functions. All these novel aspects, mainly focused on the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4, were presented by pioneers in the field during the symposium held at the sixth International Congress of Neuroendocrinology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA in June 2006.",[],Journal of molecular endocrinology,2007-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'Rostene', 'firstname': 'William', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'INSERM U732, Universitó Pet M Curie, Hôpital St-Antoine, Paris Cedex 12, France. rostene@st-antoine.inserm.fr'}, {'lastname': 'Buckingham', 'firstname': 'Julia C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1677/JME-07-0006,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc65cea0>
279,17325383,Abnormal prion protein in the pituitary in sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,"By using high-sensitivity Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, pituitary glands from patients with sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD and vCJD, respectively) were analysed for the presence of the protease-resistant form of the prion protein (PrPres). PrPres was detected in a greater proportion of vCJD pituitaries than sCJD pituitaries and was localized predominantly in the neurohypophysis. PrPres was also detected in a recurrent pituitary adenoma from an sCJD patient. Immunohistochemical analysis showed sparse positive labelling, predominantly in folliculostellate cells, in vCJD and sCJD adenohypophyses. The PrPres glycosylation pattern in the vCJD neurohypophyses showed a predominance of the unglycosylated band, which differed markedly from patterns found in all other vCJD tissues. The presence of PrPres in the pituitary of CJD patients at autopsy suggests that human growth hormone-related iatrogenic CJD may have indeed resulted from infectivity in collected pituitaries rather than necessarily from contamination of pituitary pools by adjacent brain tissue.",[],The Journal of general virology,2007-02-28,"[{'lastname': 'Peden', 'firstname': 'Alexander H', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and Division of Pathology, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ritchie', 'firstname': 'Diane L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and Division of Pathology, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Uddin', 'firstname': 'Hafsana P', 'initials': 'HP', 'affiliation': 'National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and Division of Pathology, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Dean', 'firstname': 'Andrew F', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': ""Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Hills Road, Cambridge, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Schiller', 'firstname': 'Kimberley A F', 'initials': 'KAF', 'affiliation': 'National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and Division of Pathology, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Head', 'firstname': 'Mark W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and Division of Pathology, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ironside', 'firstname': 'James W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and Division of Pathology, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.'}]",,,,,10.1099/vir.0.81913-0,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d97b7f40>
280,17213040,Pineal and cortical melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 are decreased in Alzheimer's disease.,"The pineal hormone melatonin is involved in physiological transduction of temporal information from the light dark cycle to circadian and seasonal behavioural rhythms, as well as possessing neuroprotective properties. Melatonin and its receptors MT1 and MT2, which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, are impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with severe consequences to neuropathology and clinical symptoms. The present data provides the first immunohistochemical evidence for the cellular localization of the both melatonin receptors in the human pineal gland and occipital cortex, and demonstrates their alterations in AD. We localized MT1 and MT2 in the pineal gland and occipital cortex of 7 elderly controls and 11 AD patients using immunohistochemistry with peroxidase-staining. In the pineal gland both MT1 and MT2 were localized to pinealocytes, whereas in the cortex both receptors were expressed in some pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells. In patients with AD, parallel to degenerative tissue changes, there was an overall decrease in the intensity of receptors in both brain regions. In line with our previous findings, melatonin receptor expression in AD is impaired in two additional brain areas, and may contribute to disease pathology.",[],European journal of histochemistry : EJH,2007-01-11,"[{'lastname': 'Brunner', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Psychiatric University Clinics, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sözer-Topcular', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jockers', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ravid', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Angeloni', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fraschini', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Eckert', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Müller-Spahn', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Savaskan', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d97dc400>
281,17171187,"Citicoline: pharmacological and clinical review, 2006 update.","Cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine, CDP-choline, or citicoline is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of structural phospholipids in cell membranes, particularly phosphatidylcholine. Following administration by both the oral and parenteral routes, citicoline releases its two main components, cytidine and choline. Absorption by the oral route is virtually complete, and bioavailability by the oral route is therefore approximately the same as by the intravenous route. Once absorbed, citicoline is widely distributed throughout the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches the central nervous system (CNS), where it is incorporated into the membrane and microsomal phospholipid fraction. Citicoline activates biosynthesis of structural phospholipids of neuronal membranes, increases brain metabolism, and acts upon the levels of different neurotransmitters. Thus, citicoline has been experimentally shown to increase norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the CNS. Owing to these pharmacological mechanisms, citicoline has a neuroprotective effect in hypoxic and ischemic conditions, decreasing the volume of ischemic lesion, and also improves learning and memory performance in animal models of brain aging. In addition, citicoline has been shown to restore the activity of mitochondrial ATPase and membrane Na+/K+ATPase, to inhibit activation of certain phospholipases, and to accelerate reabsorption of cerebral edema in various experimental models. Citicoline has also been shown to be able to inhibit mechanisms of apoptosis associated to cerebral ischemia and in certain neurodegeneration models, and to potentiate neuroplasticity mechanisms. Citicoline is a safe drug, as shown by the toxicological tests conducted, that has no significant systemic cholinergic effects and is a well tolerated product. These pharmacological characteristics and the action mechanisms of citicoline suggest that this product may be indicated for treatment of cerebral vascular disease, head trauma (HT) of varying severity, and cognitive disorders of different causes. In studies conducted in the treatment of patients with HT, citicoline was able to accelerate recovery from post-traumatic coma and neurological deficits, achieving an improved final functional outcome, and to shorten hospital stay in these patients. Citicoline also improved the mnesic and cognitive disorders seen after HT of minor severity that constitute the so-called post-concussional syndrome. In the treatment of patients with acute ischemic cerebral vascular disease, citicoline accelerates recovery of consciousness and motor deficit, achieves a better final outcome, and facilitates rehabilitation of these patients. The other major indication of citicoline is for treatment of senile cognitive impairment, either secondary to degenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease) or to chronic cerebral vascular disease. In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, citicoline improves scores in cognitive rating scales, while in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type it stops the course of disease, and neuroendocrine, neuroimmunomodulatory, and neurophysiological benefits have been reported. Citicoline has also been shown to be effective in Parkinson disease, drug addictions, and alcoholism, as well as in amblyopia and glaucoma. No serious side effects have occurred in any series of patients treated with citicoline, which attests to the safety of treatment with citicoline.",[],Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,2006-12-16,"[{'lastname': 'Secades', 'firstname': 'Julio J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Medical Department, Grupo Ferrer S.A., Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Lorenzo', 'firstname': 'José Luis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,(c) 2006 Prous Science.

283,17097768,Pineal calcification in Alzheimer's disease: an in vivo study using computed tomography.,"Melatonin has been postulated to have diverse properties, acting as an antioxidant, a neuroprotector, or a stabilizer within the circadian timing system, and is thus thought to be involved in the aging process and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used computed tomography to determine the degree of pineal calcification (DOC), an intra-individual melatonin deficit marker, as well as the size of uncalcified pineal tissue, in 279 consecutive memory clinic outpatients (AD: 155; other dementia: 25; mild cognitive impairment: 33; depression: 66) and 37 age-matched controls. The size of uncalcified pineal tissue in patients with AD (mean 0.15 cm(2) [S.D. 0.24]) was significantly smaller than in patients with other types of dementia (0.26 [0.34]; P=0.038), with depression (0.28 [0.34]; P=0.005), or in controls (0.25 [0.31]; P=0.027). Additionally, the DOC in patients with AD (mean 76.2% [S.D. 26.6]) was significantly higher than in patients with other types of dementia (63.7 [34.7]; P=0.042), with depression (60.5 [33.8]; P=0.001), or in controls (64.5 [30.6]; P=0.021). These two findings may reflect two different aspects of melatonin in AD. On the one hand, the absolute amount of melatonin excretion capability, as indicated by uncalcified pineal volume, refers to the antioxidant properties of melatonin. On the other hand, the relative reduction in melatonin production capability in the individual, as indicated by DOC, refers to the circadian properties of melatonin.",[],Neurobiology of aging,2006-11-14,"[{'lastname': 'Mahlberg', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charité Campus Mitte, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Turmstrasse 21, D-10559 Berlin, Germany. richard.mahlberg@charite.de'}, {'lastname': 'Walther', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kalus', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bohner', 'firstname': 'Georg', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Haedel', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Reischies', 'firstname': 'Friedel M', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kühl', 'firstname': 'Klaus-Peter', 'initials': 'KP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hellweg', 'firstname': 'Rainer', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kunz', 'firstname': 'Dieter', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2006.10.003,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d97c7b30>

Because of this and other inconsistencies in the estrogen hypothesis, we propose that another hormone of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, luteinizing hormone, is a major factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Specifically, we suspect that the increase in gonadotropin concentrations, and not the decrease in steroid hormone (e.g., estrogen) production following menopause/andropause, is a primary causative factor for the development of Alzheimer disease.

285,16925587,Hypothalamic-endocrine aspects in Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary and fatal disorder caused by an expanded CAG triplet repeat in the HD gene, resulting in a mutant form of the protein huntingtin. Wild-type and mutant huntingtin are expressed in most tissues of the body but the normal function of huntingtin is not fully known. In HD, the neuropathology is characterized by intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of huntingtin aggregates, and cell death primarily in striatum and cerebral cortex. However, hypothalamic atrophy occurs at early stages of HD with loss of orexin- and somatostatin-containing cell populations. Several symptoms of HD such as sleep disturbances, alterations in circadian rhythm, and weight loss may be due to hypothalamic dysfunction. Endocrine changes including increased cortisol levels, reduced testosterone levels and increased prevalence of diabetes are found in HD patients. In HD mice, alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occurs as well as pancreatic beta-cell and adipocyte dysfunction. Increasing evidence points towards important pathology of the hypothalamus and the endocrine system in HD. As many neuroendocrine factors are secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine, it is possible that their levels may reflect the disease state in the central nervous system. Investigating neuroendocrine changes in HD opens up the possibility of finding biomarkers to evaluate future therapies for HD, as well as of identifying novel targets for therapeutic interventions.",[],The European journal of neuroscience,2006-08-24,"[{'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Asa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Neuronal Survival Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, BMC A10, 22184 Lund, Sweden. asa.petersen@med.lu.se'}, {'lastname': 'Björkqvist', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04985.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d97a9770>

16182262",Changes in the immune system in depression and dementia: causal or coincidental effects?,"Epidemiological studies show that there is a correlation between chronic depression and the likelihood of dementia in later life. There is evidence that inflammatory changes in the brain are pathological features of both depression and dementia. This suggests that an increase in inflammation-induced apoptosis, together with a reduction in the synthesis of neurotrophic factors caused by a rise in brain glucocorticoids, may play a role in the pathology of these disorders. A reduction in the neuroprotective components of the kynurenine pathway such as kynurenic acid, and an increase in the neurodegenerative components, 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid, contribute to the pathological changes. Such changes are postulated to cause neuronal damage, and thereby predispose chronically depressed patients to dementia.
Los estudios epidemiológicos demuestran que existe una correlación entre la depresión crónica y la probabilidad de desarrollar una demencia. Hay evidencias que los cambios inflamatorios en el cerebro constituyen características patológicas tanto de la depresión como de la demencia. Esto sugiere que un aumento en la apoptosis inducida por la inflamación, junto con una reducción en la síntesis de factores neurotróficos causada por un aumento en los glucocorticoides cerebrales, puede tener un papel en la patología de estos trastornos. Una reducción en los componentes neurodegenerativos, el ácido quinolínico y la 3-hidroxikinurenina, contribuyen a los cambios patológicos. Se postula que tales cambios causan daño neuronal y de esa manera predisponen a los pacientes con depresiones crónicas a la demencia.

Ce qui suggère qu'une augmentation de l'apoptose provoquée par l'inflammation, accompagnée d'une réduction de la synthèse de facteurs neurotrophiques causée par une élévation des glucocorticoïdes cérébraux, puisse jouer un rôle dans la pathologie de ces troubles. Les modifications pathologiques sont dues à une réduction des composés neuroprotecteurs de la voie de la kynurénine, tels que l'acide kynurénique, et à une augmentation des composés neurodégénératifs, les acides 3-hydroxykynurénine et quinolinique.

Analysis of detailed autopsies to correlate clinical and pathological findings in two men severely affected with SIOD.
As predicted by the clinical course, T cell deficiency in peripheral lymphoid organs, defective chondrogenesis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, cerebral ischaemic lesions and premature atherosclerosis were identified. Clinically unexpected findings included a paucity of B cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs, emperipolesis-like (penetration of one cell by another) abnormalities in the adenohypophysis, fatty infiltration of the cardiac right ventricular wall, pulmonary emphysema, testicular hypoplasia with atrophy and azospermia, and clustering of small cerebral vessels.
A regulatory role for the SMARCAL1 protein in the proliferation of chondrocytes, lymphocytes and spermatozoa, as well as in the development or maintenance of cardiomyocytes and in vascular homoeostasis, is suggested.

289,16838900,[A chronobiological approach in treatment of sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's dementia patients].,"Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is often accompanied by severe sleep disturbances. The manifestation of the sleep disturbances is twofold: nighttime hyperarousal sometimes accompanied by irritability and agitation, and daytime excessive sleepiness. Thus, although treatment with sedatives or hypnotics may offer some relief to the nighttime hyperarousal, the daytime excessive sleepiness remains mostly unresolved. Recently, however, more promising results in relief of excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as nighttime hyperarousal, are offered by the chronobiological approach. This approach attributes the sleep problems of AD patients to a dysfunction in a broader neuronal mechanism, namely the biological clock, that paces various physiological functions, among which is the sleep-wake cycle. The biological clock, situated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, receives environmental light input via neuronal signals from the retina. The SCN, in turn, innervates the pineal gland, that is responsible for the production and release of melatonin. Light stimulus causes the attenuation of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland; whereas the cessation of light increases melatonin secretion. In diurnal mammals, the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is in accordance with sleep onset. The chronobiological approach offers two main treatments to the sleep problems in AD patients: morning exposure to bright light and evening administration of melatonin, both of which show at least moderate success in restoring the sleep-wake cycle in AD patients, that is more marked in the early stages of the disease.",[],Harefuah,2006-07-15,"[{'lastname': 'Doljansky', 'firstname': 'Julia T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Sleep and Fatigue Medicine, the Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer .

290,16818472,"Pineal clock gene oscillation is disturbed in Alzheimer's disease, due to functional disconnection from the ""master clock"".","The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the ""master clock"" of the mammalian brain. It coordinates the peripheral clocks in the body, including the pineal clock that receives SCN input via a multisynaptic noradrenergic pathway. Rhythmic pineal melatonin production is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that the clock genes hBmal1, hCry1, and hPer1 were rhythmically expressed in the pineal of controls (Braak 0). Moreover, hPer1 and hbeta1-adrenergic receptor (hbeta1-ADR) mRNA were positively correlated and showed a similar daily pattern. In contrast, in both preclinical (Braak I-II) and clinical AD patients (Braak V-VI), the rhythmic expression of clock genes was lost as well as the correlation between hPer1 and hbeta1-ADR mRNA. Intriguingly, hCry1 mRNA was increased in clinical AD. These changes are probably due to a disruption of the SCN control, as they were mirrored in the rat pineal deprived of SCN control. Indeed, a functional disruption of the SCN was observed from the earliest AD stages onward, as shown by decreased vasopressin mRNA, a clock-controlled major output of the SCN. Thus, a functional disconnection between the SCN and the pineal from the earliest AD stage onward could account for the pineal clock gene changes and underlie the circadian rhythm disturbances in AD.",[],FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2006-07-05,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Ying-Hui', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. d.f.swaab@nin.knaw.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'Fischer', 'firstname': 'David F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kalsbeek', 'firstname': 'Andries', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Garidou-Boof', 'firstname': 'Marie-Laure', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'van der Vliet', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'van Heijningen', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Rong-Yu', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Jiang-Ning', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'Dick F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1096/fj.05-4446fje,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9587a40>
291,16702789,Stress and dementia: the role of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis.,"Hippocampus plays a crucial role in learning and memory and, in spite of its remarkable plasticity, it is also particularly sensitive to stress hormones due to its high concentration of corticosteroid receptors. Indeed, adrenal steroids modulate hippocampal plasticity, acting on excitability and long term potentiation or depression. By a chronobiological approach, we studied the cortisol and DHEAS secretion in clinically healthy old subjects and in age-matched demented patients, including both the degenerative and the vascular type. When compared to young controls, both clinically healthy elderly subjects and demented patients, particularly those with AD, had significantly higher cortisol levels at night time, i.e. at the moment of the maximal sensitivity of HPA axis to stimulatory or inhibitory inputs. At the same time, a clear age- and disease-dependent reduction of DHEAS secretion was found. Thus the cortisol to DHEAS molar ratio was significantly higher in healthy old subjects, and even more in demented patients, when compared to young controls, and significantly linked to both age and cognitive impairment. Finally, the quantitative and qualitative changes of the adrenal secretory pattern were significantly correlated with the decline of hippocampal volumes, measured by MRI. In conclusion, several lines of evidence deal with a pathogenetic role of stress hormones in the occurrence and progression of cognitive disorders in elderly subjects. The consequent hippocampal neuronal impairment may in turn be responsible for the continuous activation of HPA axis and the increased hypothalamic expression of vasopressin and corticotropin releasing hormone.",[],Aging clinical and experimental research,2006-05-17,"[{'lastname': 'Magri', 'firstname': 'Flavia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'UO of Internal Medicine and Endocrinology, IRCCS S.

292,16613897,Progressive alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by a triad of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Although many of these symptoms are likely to be related to central nervous system pathology, others may be due to changes in peripheral tissues. The R6/2 mouse, a transgenic model of HD expressing exon 1 of the human HD gene, develops progressive alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reminiscent of a Cushing-like syndrome. We observed muscular atrophy, reduced bone mineral density, abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance in the mice. All these changes could be consequences of increased glucocorticoid levels. Indeed, hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex and a progressive increase in serum and urine corticosterone levels were found in R6/2 mice. In addition, the intermediate pituitary lobe was markedly enlarged and circulating adreno-corticotrophic hormone (ACTH) increased. Under normal conditions dopamine represses the ACTH expression. In the R6/2 mice, however, the expression of pituitary dopamine D2 receptors was reduced by half, possibly explaining the increase in ACTH. Urinary samples from 82 HD patients and 68 control subjects were analysed for cortisol: in accord with the observations in the R6/2 mice, urinary cortisol increased in parallel with disease progression. This progressive increase in cortisol may contribute to the clinical symptoms, such as muscular wasting, mood changes and some of the cognitive deficits that occur in HD.",[],Human molecular genetics,2006-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Björkqvist', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Neuronal Survival Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, BMC A10, Lund, Sweden. maria.bjorkqvist@med.lu.se'}, {'lastname': 'Petersén', 'firstname': 'Asa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bacos', 'firstname': 'Karl', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Isaacs', 'firstname': 'Jeremy', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Norlén', 'firstname': 'Per', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gil', 'firstname': 'Joana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Popovic', 'firstname': 'Natalija', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sundler', 'firstname': 'Frank', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bates', 'firstname': 'Gillian P', 'initials': 'GP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tabrizi', 'firstname': 'Sarah J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brundin', 'firstname': 'Patrik', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mulder', 'firstname': 'Hindrik', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1093/hmg/ddl094,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d95717c0>

Several lines of evidence have indicated that GRP and its receptor (GRPR) might also be involved in the neurochemical alterations associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders. GRP and GRPR are distributed throughout the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Altered levels of BB-like peptides have been found in the CNS of patients with schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Dysfunctions in GRPR-induced cellular calcium signaling have been reported in fibroblasts from patients with Alzheimer's disease. A translocation in the GRPR gene has been associated with autism. Pharmacological and genetic studies in rodents have shown that GRPRs in brain areas such as the dorsal hippocampus and amygdala are importantly involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and aspects of behavior that might be altered in disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia, depression, autism and dementia. Behaviors modulated by the GRPR in rodents include grooming, food intake, stereotypy, social behavior, and emotionally-motivated learning and memory.

295,16457953,"Continuous i.c.v. infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor modifies hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, locomotor activity and body temperature rhythms in adult male rats.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is a neurotrophin belonging to the nerve growth factor family, which is involved in the differentiation and survival of many types of neurons. It also participates in neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity in adult rats. Our previous studies showed that a single brain-derived neurotrophic factor injection modifies hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in adult male rats. To investigate the effect of chronic brain-derived neurotrophic factor administration on some physiological parameters, adult rats were implanted with osmotic micro-pumps to deliver brain-derived neurotrophic factor continuously for 14 days in the lateral ventricle (12 microg/day/rat). mRNA levels were evaluated by in situ hybridization analysis, peptide contents and plasma hormone concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Animals were also equipped with telemetric transmitters to study locomotor activity and temperature rhythms modifications, since hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is known to modulate these two parameters. Decreased body weight was used as a control of brain-derived neurotrophic factor access to hypothalamic areas as already documented. In the hypothalamus the continuous brain-derived neurotrophic factor treatment increases: (i) the mRNA steady state levels of corticotropin releasing hormone and arginin-vasopressin in the paraventricular nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus; (ii) the surface of corticotropin releasing hormone and arginin-vasopressin mRNA signals in these nuclei as detected by in situ hybridization, and (iii) the corticotropin releasing hormone and arginin-vasopressin contents. The plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone were decreased and increased, respectively. Finally, this treatment increased daily locomotor activity and temperature, and provoked some circadian perturbations. These results obtained after chronic brain-derived neurotrophic factor administration extend data on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor involvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation and illustrate its effects on the locomotor and temperature rhythms. They also allow demonstrating that the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by brain-derived neurotrophic factor differs according to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor administration mode, i.e. acute injection or chronic administration.",[],Neuroscience,2006-02-07,"[{'lastname': 'Naert', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Dementia Laboratory, Inserm U710, EPHE, University of Montpellier 2, Place Eugène Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ixart', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tapia-Arancibia', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Givalois', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.12.028,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc44f810>

298,16183237,Melatonin and sleep in aging population.,"The neurohormone melatonin is released from the pineal gland in close association with the light-dark cycle. There is a temporal relationship between the nocturnal rise in melatonin secretion and the 'opening of the sleep gate' at night. This association, as well as the sleep promoting effect of exogenous melatonin, implicates the pineal product in the physiological regulation of sleep. Aging is associated with a significant reduction in sleep continuity and quality. A decreased production of melatonin with age is documented in a majority of studies. Diminished nocturnal melatonin secretion with severe disturbances in sleep/wake rhythm has been consistently reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent survey on the effects of melatonin in sleep disturbances, including all age groups, failed to document significant and clinically meaningful effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep quality, efficiency and latency. However, in clinical trials involving elderly insomniacs and AD patients suffering from sleep disturbances exogenous melatonin has repeatedly been found to be effective in improving sleep. The results indicate that exogenous melatonin is more effective to promote sleep in the presence of a diminished production of endogenous melatonin.

299,16146712,Neuroserpin.,"Neuroserpin is a member of the serpin family of serine protease inhibitors. Tissue distribution analysis reveals a predominantly neuronal expression during the late stages of neurogenesis and, in the adult brain, in areas where synaptic changes are associated with learning and memory (synaptic plasticity). In vitro studies revealed complex formation between neuroserpin and different serine proteases, i.e. tPA, uPA, and plasmin. The neuroserpin-target complex has so far not been characterized in vivo. However, some investigations help to understand the functional role of this serpin. Neuroserpin was shown to be involved in the regulation of the morphology of neuroendocrine cells in culture, possibly by modulating the degradation of the extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymes such as tPA. Moreover, a role of neuroserpin in mood regulation has been deduced from the over- and underexpression of neuroserpin in genetically modified mice, which showed increased anxiety and novelty-induced hypo-locomotion. In pathological conditions of the central nervous system (i.e. stroke and seizures), neuroserpin plays a neuroprotective role, probably by blocking the deleterious effects of tPA. A familial form of a neurodegenerative disease, termed familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies, is caused by point mutations in the neuroserpin gene. This condition is characterized by the intracellular polymerization and accumulation of mutated neuroserpin, leading to neuronal death and dementia.",[],Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,2005-09-09,"[{'lastname': 'Galliciotti', 'firstname': 'Giovanna', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sonderegger', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.2741/1778,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc9dd680>

Eighty percent of those contaminated by HCV keep bearing the virus chronically although they remain asymptomatic during many years. HCV infection is associated with psychiatric symptoms like depression. Together with other factors (eg the severity of hepatic condition), depression may induce significant impairment in quality of life. Conversely, some psychiatric conditions may increase the risk of HCV infection. In drug-addicted subjects using intravenous route, HCV contamination rate ranges from 74 to 100%. Compared with general population, a higher HCV contamination rate has also been noticed in some other subgroups of subjects (patients with alcohol abuse or dependence, with alcohol-induced hepatic disease and psychiatric inpatients). However, no valid explanation to this phenomenon has been established. Interferon alpha and depression - Interferons are a variety of cytokines naturally produced by human tissues and have also been synthesized for therapeutic purposes (treatment of a variety of cancers and viral infections). Many psychobehavioural symptoms are observed under IFNalpha treatment. Among them, mood disorders are known to occur early after entry into treatment and to be within the reach of preventive measures. The reported frequency of depression during IFNalpha treatment ranges from 0 to 37%. This variation reflects either methodological biases (eg differences in psychiatric assessment) or the heterogeneity of the population of patients accepted in therapeutic protocols. Note that the adjunction of ribavirine to IFNalpha in therapeutic protocols has not brought any changes in the depression frequency. The causal relationship between IFNalpha administration and the occurrence of mood disorders has been tackled by various recent research works focusing on the importance of the immune system in the pathophysiology of depression. Miscellaneous pathophysiological hypotheses -- nature of the psychobehavioural symptomatology -- in addition to depressive symptoms, IFNalpha treatment also induces various cognitive impairments and disruptions in EEG patterns. These symptoms are consistent with a mild subcortical dementia. Data resulting from pharmacological trials in humans and in animals are controversial (eg IFNalpha-induced symptoms being alleviated by both immune and antidepressant therapies). However, the debate about the nature of the psychobehavioural disorders observed under IFNalpha treatment might be no longer relevant in the light of recent theories which regard depression as a maladaptive response to a particular form of stress, namely a deep and diffuse feeling of sickness (""malaise""). These theoretical views ascribe the production of depressive symptoms to a disruption in the immune function, mediated by the variety of cytokines. The therapeutic effects of anti-depressive drugs are thus attributed to their analgesic properties, reducing the ""malaise"" feeling underlying depressive symptoms. Necessity of a second messanger -- accordingly to current pathophysiological theories, depression results from disorders of various CNS functions, mainly limbic, monaminergic and neuroendocrinal systems. Though, exogenous IFNalpha does not cross the blood-brain barrier when unscathed and an intermediary mechanism is necessary. First to be addressed is the cytokines system itself since it is composed of numerous different molecules interacting in an infinite number of possible combinations. Some of these cytokines (eg some interleukins) both are activated by IFNalpha and can reach CNS; they are good candidates for the role of second messenger mediating the induction of psychobehavioural disorders. Second, keeping in mind that serotonin is a monoaminergic neurotransmitter classically involved in depression pathophysiology, other works have demonstrated that IFNalpha modulates the peripheral activity of indolamine-dioxygenase -- a regulating enzyme of serotonin metabolism -- possibly through lymphocyte T CD4 activation. Third, other authors have postulated an immune-induced vagal mechanism to explain depression caused by IFNalpha. Action of IFNalpha on the neuroendocrine and on neuromodulating functions: monoaminergic hypothesis -- cytokines could have an influence on the mood through their modulating role on the serotoninergic system. IFNalpha treatment is reported to produce: 1) a decrease in tryptophan availability for serotonin synthesis, 2) a decrease in the 5-HIAA level in the LCR, and 3) a modification of the central serotoninergic receptors. Moreover, selective inhibitors of serotonin transporters are effective to treat or prevent depression caused by IFNalpha. Many studies support the serotonin-transporter hypothesis: in vitro, both IFNalpha and interleukine 4 (IL-4) increases the expression of serotonin transporter gene, IFNalpha increases in the production of IL-4 by mononucleus cells (not found in vivo). Serotoninergic system can also be altered by a peripheral action of IFNalpha on trytophan catabolism by activating a concurrent pathway (known as ""kynurenine pathway"") to serotonin synthesis. Finally, serotonin-mediated vulnerability to the psychobehavioural effects of IFNalpha could be underlain by a polymorphism of serotonin transporter gene. Concerning the other monoaminergic systems, IFNalpha seems to have an amphetamine-like effect at its first administration, followed by a decrease in dopaminergic tone with chronic administration. Dopaminergic depletion, subsequent to psychostimulant abuse for instance, results in severe depressive syndromes. Interactions between IFNalpha and noradrenergic system have also been reported. Neuroendocrinian hypothesis -- when administered through central or peripheral way, IFNalpha simulates/inhibits the corticotrope axis and alters endorphin system as shown by the induction of analgesia, catatonia and behavioural slowdown that can be suppressed by opioid antagonists. IFNalpha neurotoxic effects are successfully treated by naltrexone. Lastly, IFNalpha is known to cause disorders in thyroid function that are likely to contribute to the production or aggravation of mood disorders.
A better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying psychiatric side-effects of IFNalpha is essential to extend access to treatment to some categories of patients that remain excluded from the protocols.

An association between temporal lobe volume and cognitive function has been shown in several studies. Increased limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) axis function has been suggested to be related to hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment. Our hypothesis was that there is a clear link between hippocampal volume -- notably of the CA1 region -- memory (episodic and visuospatial) and decreased feedback sensitivity in the LHPA axis in AD.
Sixteen medication-free outpatients with mild to moderate AD were included. Hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Dexamethasone suppression tests were performed using .5 mg and .25 mg dexamethasone. Three different components in the neuropsychological battery -- Rey 15 item memory test, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) word recall and spatial span from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised neuropsychological instrument (WAIS-R NI) -- were found to represent episodic and visuospatial memory.
Low hippocampal CA1 volume and high post-dexamethasone cortisol levels in combination were significantly associated with Rey 15 item memory and spatial span test outcomes. No association was found between LHPA feedback and hippocampal volume.

302,16115597,Neuroendocrinology of female aging.,"Because the average human life span has increased, a greater part of more women's lives will be lived in a hypoestrogenic state.
This article provides an overview of our current knowledge of the neuroendocrine processes in the aging female brain.
Using the search terms cardiovascular disease, cognition, dementia, depression, estrogens, female aging, gonadotropins, immune function, mood, neuroendocrinology, neurotransmitters, osteoporosis, and ovarian steroids, a review of English-language literature on the MEDLINE database was conducted from 1970 through June 2004.
It is thought that the temporal patterns of neural signals are altered during middle age, leading to cessation of reproductive cycles, and that the complex interplay of ovarian and hypothalamic/pituitary pacemakers becomes increasingly dysfunctional with aging, ultimately resulting in menopause. Estrogen deficiency is associated with low mood, whereas estrogen therapy tends to be linked with improvements in measures of well-being and a decline in depression scores. It is likely that these effects of estrogens are mediated through changes in the metabolism of serotonin and nor epinephrine. Evidence exists to support the role of estrogens in specific effects on cognitive functioning in women, enhancing aspects of verbal memory, abstract reasoning, and information processing. Significant gender dimorphism is evident in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The effects of estrogens on the cardiovascular system are complex; recent evidence suggests a negative role for oral estrogen in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Additionally, estrogens increase the risk of stroke, and estrogen deficiency influences the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in both men and women.
Changes in the neuroendocrine system due to the loss of ovarian function at menopause have an important biological role in the control of reproductive and nonreproductive functions, and regulate mood, memory, cognition, behavior, immune function, the locomotor system, and cardiovascular functions.

303,16046283,The neuroprotective actions of corticotropin releasing hormone.,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) modulates the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and has a key role in mediating neuroendocrine effects that occur in response to stressful stimuli. Disruption of the CRH system however has been shown to be closely associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and these observations prompted an investigation into the potential neuroprotective effects of the hormone. In addition to its regulatory affects on the molecular processes that underlie AD i.e., amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and potentially tau phosphorylation, evidence is provided that the neuroprotective effects of CRH are mediated by a number of diverse mechanisms. These stem from activation of its high affinity receptor, the CRH type 1 receptor, and involve the induction of protective intracellular pathways including PKA-CREB that eventually lead to expression of neurotrophic factors. Conversely, inhibition of harmful events, such as caspase activation during apoptosis may also occur.

2941815",The gonadotropin connection in Alzheimer's disease.,"Although not traditionally thought of as regulators of neuronal function, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) hormones luteinizing hormone (LH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and activins possess neuronal receptors. These receptors are found throughout the limbic system on a number of different cell types, and, like reproductive tissues, the expression of these receptors is regulated by hormonal feedback loops. These hormones and their receptors regulate structure and a diverse range of functions in the brain. Therefore, it is not surprising that the dysregulation of the HPG axis with menopause and andropause (leading to elevated LH, GnRH, and activin signaling but decreased sex steroid signaling) might promote alterations in both the structure and function of neuronal cells. To date, most evidence has accumulated for a role of LH in promoting neurodegenerative changes. LH is known to cross the blood-brain barrier, receptors for LH are most concentrated in the hippocampus, that region of the brain most vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and LH is significantly elevated in both the serum and the pyramidal neurons of AD subjects. LH promotes the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid-beta precursor protein in vitro, and the antigonadotropin leuprolide acetate decreases amyloid generation in mice. Moreover, leuprolide acetate improves the cognitive performance and decreases amyloid-beta deposition in aged transgenic mice carrying the Swedish AbetaPP mutation. Therefore, the elevation of LH with the dysregulation of the HPG axis at menopause and andropause is a physiologically relevant signal that could promote neurodegeneration. Epidemiological support for a role of LH/GnRH in AD is evidenced by a reduction in neurodegenerative disease among prostate cancer patients a group known to GnRH agonists. Clinical trials are underway for the treatment of AD using GnRH analogs and should provide further insights into the gonadotropin connection in AD.",[],Endocrine,2005-07-22,"[{'lastname': 'Meethal', 'firstname': 'Sivan Vadakkadath', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Section of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Veterans Administration Hospital, Madison, 53705, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Mark A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bowen', 'firstname': 'Richard L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Atwood', 'firstname': 'Craig S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1385/ENDO:26:3:317,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc9bf900>
305,16024763,Estrogen bows to a new master: the role of gonadotropins in Alzheimer pathogenesis.,"Epidemiological data showing a predisposition of women to develop Alzheimer disease (AD) led many researchers to investigate the role of sex steroids, namely estrogen, in disease pathogenesis. Although there is circumstantial support for the role of estrogen, the unexpected results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Memory Study, which reported an increase in the risk for probable dementia and impaired cognitive performance in postmenopausal women treated with a combination of estrogen and progestin, have raised serious questions regarding the protective effects of estrogen. Although explanations for these surprising results vary greatly, the WHI Memory Study cannot be correctly interpreted without a complete investigation of the effects of the other hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis on the aging brain. Certain hormones of the HPG axis, namely, the gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), are not only involved in regulating reproductive function via a complex feedback loop but are also known to cross the blood-brain barrier. We propose that the increase in gonadotropin concentrations, and not the decrease in steroid hormone (e.g., estrogen) production following menopause/andropause, is a potentially primary causative factor for the development of AD. In this review, we examine how the gonadotropins may play a central and determining role in modulating the susceptibility to, and progression of, AD. On this basis, we suggest that the results of the WHI Memory Study are not only predictable but also avoidable by therapeutically targeting the gonadotropins instead of the sex steroids.",[],Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2005-07-19,"[{'lastname': 'Webber', 'firstname': 'Kate M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, 2085 Adelbert Rd., Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Casadesus', 'firstname': 'Gemma', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marlatt', 'firstname': 'Michael W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hamlin', 'firstname': 'Clive R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Atwood', 'firstname': 'Craig S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bowen', 'firstname': 'Richard L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Mark A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1196/annals.1347.020,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d96895e0>

The authors also discuss the effects of sleep on declarative memory consolidation, in particular. This focused review suggests that some of the declarative memory dysfunction with normal aging, and possibly procedural memory dysfunction, may be partially reversible by instituting methods to augment slow-wave sleep (SWS). Also, agents that decrease nocturnal corticotropin-releasing hormone and the cortisol nadir and enhance SWS may offer potential ways to manipulate the HPA axis/rhythm and improve sleep and memory.

309,15758865,The diagnosis and treatment of stress-induced anovulation.,"Behaviors that activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal (HPT) axis can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in women and men. Individuals with functional hypothalamic hypogonadism typically engage in a combination of behaviors that serve as psychogenic stressors and present metabolic challenges. Complete recovery of gonadal function depends upon restoration of the HPA and HPT axes. Hormone replacement strategies have limited benefit because they do not promote recovery from these allostatic endocrine adjustments in the HPA and HPT axes. Indeed, the rationale for the use of sex steroid replacement is based on the erroneous assumption that functional forms of hypothalamic hypogonadism represent only an alteration in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Further, use of sex hormones masks deficits that accrue from altered HPA and HPT function. Long-term deleterious consequences of stress-induced anovulation may include an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, depression, other psychiatric conditions, and dementia. Although fertility can be restored with exogenous administration of gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH, fertility management alone will not permit recovery of the HPA and HPT axes. Failure to reverse the hormonal milieu induced by stress may increase the likelihood of poor obstetrical, fetal, or neonatal outcomes. In contrast, behavioral and psychological interventions that address problematic behaviors and attitudes have the potential to permit resumption of ovarian function along with recovery of the HPT and HPA axes. Full endocrine recovery offers better individual, maternal, and child health.",[],Minerva ginecologica,2005-03-11,"[{'lastname': 'Berga', 'firstname': 'S L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. sberga@emory.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Loucks', 'firstname': 'T L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4c4450>
310,15750215,Impaired insulin and insulin-like growth factor expression and signaling mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease--is this type 3 diabetes?,"The neurodegeneration that occurs in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is consistently associated with a number of characteristic histopathological, molecular, and biochemical abnormalities, including cell loss, abundant neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites, amyloid-beta deposits, increased activation of pro-death genes and signaling pathways, impaired energy metabolism/mitochondrial function, and evidence of chronic oxidative stress. The general inability to convincingly link these phenomena has resulted in the emergence and propagation of various heavily debated theories that focus on the role of one particular element in the pathogenesis of all other abnormalities. However, the accumulating evidence that reduced glucose utilization and deficient energy metabolism occur early in the course of disease, suggests a role for impaired insulin signaling in the pathogenesis of AD. The present work demonstrates extensive abnormalities in insulin and insulin-like growth factor type I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) signaling mechanisms in brains with AD, and shows that while each of the corresponding growth factors is normally made in central nervous system (CNS) neurons, the expression levels are markedly reduced in AD. These abnormalities were associated with reduced levels of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) mRNA, tau mRNA, IRS-associated phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospho-Akt (activated), and increased glycogen synthase kinase-3beta activity and amyloid precursor protein mRNA expression. The strikingly reduced CNS expression of genes encoding insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II, as well as the insulin and IGF-I receptors, suggests that AD may represent a neuro-endocrine disorder that resembles, yet is distinct from diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we propose the term, ""Type 3 Diabetes"" to reflect this newly identified pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration.",[],Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2005-03-08,"[{'lastname': 'Steen', 'firstname': 'Eric', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital and Brown Medical School, Providence, RI 02903, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Terry', 'firstname': 'Benjamin M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rivera', 'firstname': 'Enrique J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cannon', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Neely', 'firstname': 'Thomas R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tavares', 'firstname': 'Rose', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'X Julia', 'initials': 'XJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wands', 'firstname': 'Jack R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de la Monte', 'firstname': 'Suzanne M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.3233/jad-2005-7107,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4a7c20>

Additional influences of atherosclerosis, glucose regulation, chronic renal disease, salt, and changes in neurohormonal regulation are discussed. A review of the hemodynamic impact of arterial stiffness follows. A number of lifestyle changes and therapies that reduce arterial stiffness are presented, including weight loss, exercise, salt reduction, alcohol consumption, and neuroendocrine-directed therapies, such as those targeting the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, natriuretic peptides, insulin modulators, as well as novel therapies that target advanced glycation end products.",[],"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2005-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Zieman', 'firstname': 'Susan J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, National Institute on Aging, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Md, USA. szieman@jhmi.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Melenovsky', 'firstname': 'Vojtech', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kass', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1161/01.ATV.0000160548.78317.29,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4b9360>
312,15725334,The human pineal gland and melatonin in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"The pineal gland is a central structure in the circadian system which produces melatonin under the control of the central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN and the output of the pineal gland, i.e. melatonin, are synchronized to the 24-hr day by environmental light, received by the retina and transmitted to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract. Melatonin not only plays an important role in the regulation of circadian rhythms, but also acts as antioxidant and neuroprotector that may be of importance in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Circadian disorders, such as sleep-wake cycle disturbances, are associated with aging, and even more pronounced in AD. Many studies have reported disrupted melatonin production and rhythms in aging and in AD that, as we showed, are taking place as early as in the very first preclinical AD stages (neuropathological Braak stage I-II). Degeneration of the retina-SCN-pineal axis may underlie these changes. Our recent studies indicate that a dysfunction of the sympathetic regulation of pineal melatonin synthesis by the SCN is responsible for melatonin changes during the early AD stages. Reactivation of the circadian system (retina-SCN-pineal pathway) by means of light therapy and melatonin supplementation, to restore the circadian rhythm and to relieve the clinical circadian disturbances, has shown promising positive results.",[],Journal of pineal research,2005-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Ying-Hui', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Netherlands Institute for Brain Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'Dick F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1600-079X.2004.00196.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4b7810>

GH receptors are mainly found in the choroid plexus, thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary, putamen, and hippocampus, whereas IGF-1 receptors are mainly concentrated in the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas. In early life, GH and IGF-1 have an important role in the development and differentiation of the central nervous system. In the more developed central nervous system, GH and IGF-1 are thought to have a variety of functions such as a neuroprotective function, an appetite increasing function, various cognitive functions, and perhaps a blood flow-regulating function. In GH-deficient children and adults, improvement of cognitive functions was observed after the administration of GH. Furthermore, specific cognitive functions in healthy older subjects may improve after increasing GH or IGF-1 levels.",[],Seminars in vascular medicine,2004-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Creyghton', 'firstname': 'Wouter M', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Endocrinology, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Dam', 'firstname': 'P Sytze', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koppeschaar', 'firstname': 'Hans P F', 'initials': 'HP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1055/s-2004-835375,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db4ddc70>
315,15379604,Beyond estrogen: targeting gonadotropin hormones in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Based on epidemiological and observational studies, estrogen and hormone-replacement therapy were until recently viewed as major factors in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a recent randomized clinical trial revealed that hormone replacement therapy using estrogen plus progestin may actually exacerbate the incidence of dementia when administered to elderly women. These contradictory reports have cast grave doubt on the role of estrogen in disease pathogenesis and led us to consider an alternate hypothesis that would be consistent with both observations. Specifically, we suspect that hormones of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis such as gonadotropins, that are regulated by estrogen (or in males by testosterone), are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. One such gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone (LH), is significantly elevated in both the sera and brain tissue of patients with AD and leads to an increased production of amyloid-beta. Importantly, a key role in disease pathogenesis is further supported by the fact that the distribution of neuronal receptors for LH parallels those populations of neurons that degenerate during the course of the disease. That gonadotropins, not estrogen nor testosterone, mediate disease pathogenesis has led to a paradigm shift, not only for the treatment of AD but a wide variety of other age-related diseases. Therefore, the effects of agents that abolish LH, such as leuprolide acetate, which are currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of AD, are eagerly anticipated.",[],Current drug targets.

316,15301439,Habituation to stress and dexamethasone suppression in rats with selective basal forebrain cholinergic lesions.,"Previous studies suggest a role for basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in enhancing the inhibitory influence of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on glucocorticoid stress responses mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. An inhibitory action of the basal forebrain cholinergic (BFC) system may occur through facilitation of stress-related information processing and maintenance of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and negative feedback signaling in these target regions. The current study investigated the possibility that BFC input to the hippocampus contributes to habituation of the glucocorticoid response following repeated exposure to a stressor. Cholinergic lesions were made by microinjections of the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin into the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band, and 3 weeks later rats were subjected to six daily sessions of restraint stress. Blood samples taken before, during and after acute stress revealed a significant increase in peak activation and protracted elevation of corticosterone in cholinergic lesioned rats. After 5 days of repeated stress, however, both groups habituated to the stressor, as indicated by similarly low corticosterone profiles throughout both the response and recovery period. Against that habituated background, rats were administered a dexamethasone challenge on day 6, so that feedback status could be examined. Dexamethasone-induced suppression of endogenous corticosterone before, during, and after stress was significantly attenuated in lesioned rats. The profile of dysfunction in glucocorticoid regulation after selective cholinergic lesions in young animals may be relevant to the adrenocortical hyperactivity and negative feedback deficits seen in conditions such as normal aging and Alzheimer's dementia, in which integrity of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is compromised.",[],Hippocampus,2004-08-11,"[{'lastname': 'Helm', 'firstname': 'K A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218, USA. kassie@jhu.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Ziegler', 'firstname': 'D R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gallagher', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1002/hipo.10203,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc728ae0>
317,15271063,Oestradiol restores cell proliferation in dentate gyrus and subventricular zone of streptozotocin-diabetic mice.,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus correlates with several brain disturbances, including hypersensitivity to stress, cognitive impairment, increased risk of stroke and dementia. Within the central nervous system, the hippocampus is considered a special target for alterations associated with diabetes. Neurogenesis is a plastic event restricted to few adult brain areas: the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). First, we studied the ability for neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and SVZ of chronic diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling of cells in the S-phase, we observed a strong reduction in cell proliferation rate in both brain regions of diabetic mice killed 20 days after STZ administration. Second, because oestrogens are active neuroprotective agents, we investigated whether 17beta-oestradiol (200 micro g pellet implant in cholesterol during 10 days) restored brain cell proliferation in the diabetic mouse brain. Our results demonstrated a complete reversibility of dentate gyrus cell proliferation in oestrogen-treated diabetic mice. This plasticity change was not exclusive to the hippocampus because oestrogen treatment restored BrdU incorporation into newborn cells of the SVZ region of diabetic animals. Oestrogen treatment did not alter the hyperglycemic status of STZ-diabetic mice. Moreover, oestrogen did not modify BrdU incorporation in control animals. These data show that oestrogen treatment strongly stimulates brain neurogenesis of diabetic mice and open up new venues for understanding the potential neuroprotective role of steroid hormones in diabetic encephalopathy.",[],Journal of neuroendocrinology,2004-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Saravia', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neuroendocrine Biochemistry, Instituto de Biologia y Medicina Experimental, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Revsin', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lux-Lantos', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beauquis', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Homo-Delarche', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'De Nicola', 'firstname': 'A F', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1365-2826.2004.01223.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc73fcc0>

The clinico-histopathological and biochemical basis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Substantial evidence is presented demonstrating that it is the cholinesterases (ChEs) that constitute the organizer, the connector and the safeguard for multiple neurochemical functions and mature anatomical architecture of the brain. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the histopathological characteristics are initially and primarily associated with the degeneration of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) system in various brain regions. Multiple classic and/or putative neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, virtually all the peptide hormones of the endocrine and neuroendocrine systems in the brain, their specific synthesizing and hydrolyzing marker enzymes and associated uptake processes (transporters), and receptors, do not actually participate in the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of patients suffering from AD. The massive perturbation in different neurochemicals seen in AD is essentially caused by the ChEs-associated pathology. The graded patterns of brain ChEs expression affect the preferential vulnerability and severity of the AD clinico-pathologic presentation. It seems that the common law in nature may also dominate the destiny of brain ChEs system, i.e., the weaker the cells express AChE, the more susceptible the cells are to AD degeneration, and vice versa.",[],Medical hypotheses,2004-07-09,"[{'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Z-X', 'initials': 'ZX', 'affiliation': '2436 Rhode Island Avenue N. #3, Golden Valley, MN 55427-5011, USA. zhengxshen@yahoo.com'}]",,,,,10.1016/j.mehy.2004.02.032,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc74ee00>

Our results show that transgenic and wild-type mice did not differ in their general health status, exploratory and anxiety related behavior as well as in the activity of their sympathetic-adrenomedullary system. Significant differences, however, were found regarding body weight, amyloid plaque formation, and the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Continuous monitoring of glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations over a period of 120 days, utilizing a noninvasive technique to measure corticosterone metabolites in fecal samples, revealed that transgenic animals showed adrenocortical hyperactivity, starting very early in males (from day 30) and later in females (around day 90). It is hypothesized that these changes in the activity of the HPA axis are linked to amyloid-beta associated pathological alterations in the hippocampus, causing degenerations in the negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis leading to hypersecretion of GC. Thus, the development of adrenocortical hyperactivity might be a key-element in the understanding of AD.",[],Neurobiology of aging,2004-06-24,"[{'lastname': 'Touma', 'firstname': 'Chadi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioural Biology, University of Muenster, Badestrasse 9, D-48149 Muenster, Germany. touma@uni-muenster.de'}, {'lastname': 'Ambrée', 'firstname': 'Oliver', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Görtz', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Keyvani', 'firstname': 'Kathy', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lewejohann', 'firstname': 'Lars', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Palme', 'firstname': 'Rupert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Paulus', 'firstname': 'Werner', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schwarze-Eicker', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sachser', 'firstname': 'Norbert', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2003.09.004,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc75b270>
320,15207411,Cognitive and affective disorders in the elderly: a neuroendocrine study.,"Both in physiological and pathological brain aging, cognitive and affective disorders usually keep up with significant morphological and metabolic changes of brain areas possibly involved in the control of mood, learning and memory, as well as in the modulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The aim of this work was to study the circadian rhythm of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) in 25 old demented patients and 10 old unipolar depressed patients, compared with 21 old and 13 young controls. The circadian profile of serum cortisol was clearly flattened in elderly subjects,both healthy and demented, in comparison to young controls, with significantly higher cortisol levels at nighttime. The occurrence of minor depression was associated with a further increase of the cortisol mean levels in old demented subjects, but not in the healthy ones. The trend towards the increase of the nocturnal cortisol levels was also evident in old subjects with major depression. The decline of DHEAS secretory pattern was clearly age related,being additive factors to both dementia and major depression. No significant influence of minor depression on DHEAS secretion was found. The cortisol/DHEAS molar ratio,considered as a good index of the brain steroidal milieu, progressively increased with aging and exhibited a further increase related to the occurrence of senile dementia or minor depressive symptoms. The value of the same ratio was higher in elderly subjects with major depression, than in age-matched healthy controls. In conclusion, the occurrence of major depression or even only of depressive symptoms seems to amplify the changes of the adrenal steroidal secretory pattern, already present in physiological aging.",[],Archives of gerontology and geriatrics.

Many studies using 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric measurement have reported decreases in hippocampal volume among depressed subjects compared with controls, whereas other studies have not found any volume loss. Differences among studies have been discussed. In some studies, the volume loss appears to have functional significance including an association with memory loss. Furthermore, we have found a trend towards loss of 5-HT(2A) receptors in the hippocampus using positron emission tomography (PET) to detect regional changes in [18F]altanserin binding.

SRIF neuronal actions regulate protein phosphorylation levels, control second messenger production and modulate neuronal membrane potential. Recently, our understanding of SRIF neurobiology has been driven by new pharmacological and molecular biological tools. SRIF receptor subtype specific antibodies have identified a distinctive, yet overlapping, expression pattern for this receptor family, with multiple subtypes co-localizing in the central and peripheral nervous system. This complex expression profile has confounded efforts to establish each receptor's role in the nervous system in part by the possible homo- and heteroligomerization of the receptor proteins. However, the recent discovery of SRIF receptor subtype selective ligands, supplemented by in vitro and in vivo models with inactivated SRIF receptor genes, now provides opportunities to clearly delineate each receptor's neuronal role. The convergence of these pharmacologic, immunologic and molecular biologic approaches extend our understanding of SRIF neurobiology while promising new therapeutic avenues for SRIF research.",[],Current drug targets.

323,15066050,Qualitative and quantitative changes of melatonin levels in physiological and pathological aging and in centenarians.,"Melatonin secretion is an endogenous synchronizer, and it may possess some anti-aging properties. Thus we examined melatonin levels in physiological aging, in extreme senescence and in senile dementia. In healthy old (age 66-94 yr) and young subjects (age 23-39 yr) and in demented patients (age 68-91 yr) plasma melatonin was measured by radioimmunoassay in eight serial blood samples. In centenarians (age 100-107 yr) melatonin levels were estimated by assaying urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (aMT6s) in two different urine samples collected from 08:00 to 20:00 hours and from 20:00 to 08:00 hours. These data were compared with the aMT6s excretion of old and young controls. Elderly subjects, demented or not, exhibited a flattened circadian profile of plasma melatonin, because of the suppression of the nocturnal peak. An age-related decline of the circadian amplitude of the melatonin rhythm occurred in old subjects, especially in demented individuals. Furthermore, the melatonin nocturnal peak was significantly correlated with the severity of the cognitive impairment. aMT6s urinary excretion also declined with age. However, as in young controls, in centenarians the aMT6s excretion was significantly higher at night than during the day. In conclusion, pineal melatonin secretion is affected by age and by the degree of cognitive impairment. In centenarians the maintenance of the circadian organization of melatonin secretion may suggest that the amplitude of the nocturnal peak and/or the persistence of a prevalent nocturnal secretion may be an important marker of biological age and of health status.",[],Journal of pineal research,2004-04-07,"[{'lastname': 'Magri', 'firstname': 'Flavia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. flaviamagri@libero.it'}, {'lastname': 'Sarra', 'firstname': 'Serena', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cinchetti', 'firstname': 'Wilma', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guazzoni', 'firstname': 'Valeria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fioravanti', 'firstname': 'Marisa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cravello', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'Ettore', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1600-079X.2004.00125.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc239770>
324,14977212,Causes and consequences of disturbances of cerebral glucose metabolism in sporadic Alzheimer disease: therapeutic implications.,"Alzheimer disease is not a single disorder. Etiologically, two different types or even diseases exist: inheritance in 5% to 10% of all Alzheimer cases versus 90% to 95% AD cases whith sporadic origin (SAD). Different susceptibility genes along with adult lifestyle risk-factors- in the case of SAD the risk factor aging- may be assumed to cause the latter disorder. There is evidence that a disturbance in the insulin signal transduction pathway may be a central and early pathophysiologic event in SAD. Both, hypercortisolemia and increased adrenergic activity, in both old age and SAD may render the function of the neuronal insulin receptor vulnerable resulting in a diminished production of ATP. The reduced availability of ATP may damage the function of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus/trans Golgi network generating misfolded and malfolded proteins retained in the cell. In SAD, amyloid precursor protein is found to accumulate intracellularly thus not representing the cause but a driving force in the pathogenesis of SAD. Additionally, both disturbed insulin signaling and reduced ATP forward the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Thus, abnormalities in oxidative brain metabolism lead to the formation of two main morphologic hallmarks of SAD: senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, the therapeutic goal in SAD should be the improvement of the neuronal energy state. Findings from both basic and clinical studies showed that Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) may be appropiate to approach that goal.",[],Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2004-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Hoyer', 'firstname': 'Siegfried', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathochemistry and General Neurochemistry, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 220/221, Heidelberg, Germany 69120.'}]",,,,,10.1007/978-1-4419-8969-7_8,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc237ea0>

In particular, HPA disturbances have been associated with memory impairments, and hypercortisolemic conditions with atrophy of the hippocampus, a limbic structure closely associated with declarative memory. Recent discoveries support a more complicated picture of HPA axis function and pathology in acquiring, retrieving, and consolidating new memories. These findings include: the existence of an 'inverted U-shaped relationship"" between stimulation of brain glucocorticoid receptors and memory performance; that distinct areas of the hippocampus have been found to respond differently to cortisol stimulation; and that hippocampal atrophy has been found to be potentially reversible in some conditions, although whether such atrophy is a cause or effect of these pathological conditions is currently unclear. More longitudinal studies of HPA axis function in aging normal individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment,and individuals with Alzheimer' disease, examining pertinent variables such as APOEe-4 status, are needed to help clarify these new findings. Antiglucocorticoid agents appear to have therapeutic value in particular conditions. These results are relevant for understanding and treating memory dysfunction in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, a disorder prominently and invariably characterized by early hippocampal lesions and memory impairment.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the decreased melatonin levels, we measured monoamines and mRNA levels of enzymes of the melatonin synthesis and its noradrenergic regulation in pineal glands from 18 controls, 33 preclinical AD subjects, and 25 definite AD patients. Pineal melatonin levels were highly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid melatonin levels. The circadian melatonin rhythm disappeared because of decreased nocturnal melatonin levels in both the preclinical AD and AD patients. Also the circadian rhythm of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor mRNA disappeared in both patient groups. The precursor of melatonin, serotonin was stepwise depleted during the course of AD, as indicated by the up-regulated monoamine oxidase A mRNA and activity (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid:serotonin ratio). We conclude that a dysfunction of noradrenergic regulation and the depletion of serotonin by increased monoamine oxidase A result in the loss of melatonin rhythm already in preclinical AD.",[],The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2003-12-13,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Ying-Hui', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': ""Anhui Geriatric Institute, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230022, Anhui People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Feenstra', 'firstname': 'Matthijs G P', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Jiang-Ning', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Rong-Yu', 'initials': 'RY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Toranõ', 'firstname': 'Javier Sastre', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Van Kan', 'firstname': 'Hendrikus J M', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fischer', 'firstname': 'David F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ravid', 'firstname': 'Rivka', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'Dick F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1210/jc.2003-030833,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc242e50>

Neurodegenerative diseases, which are known to affect specific neuronal populations, may provoke neuroendocrine dysfunctions that alter the intimate relationship between both systems. In addition, these modifications may influence the progression of the neurodegenerative process. In the present review, we summarise some of the endocrine changes characterising three major neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

598014",Cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects of subclinical hypothyroidism: significance in the elderly.,"The effects of overt hypothyroidism (HO) on cognition and mood are well established, and HO is considered a common cause of reversible dementia. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that subclinical hypothyroidism (ie, elevated thyroid stimulating hormone in the presence of normal thyroxine concentrations) may be a predisposing factor for depression, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Subclinical hypothyroidism is more common than HO and is most prevalent in the elderly, particularly in women. Older adults may be more vulnerable to the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism, given age-related changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and there is an association between thyroid status and cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly.

331,12920328,Enhancement of antibody responses to influenza vaccination in the elderly following a cognitive-behavioural stress management intervention.,"Previous research has demonstrated that the psychological morbidity experienced by informal caregivers is associated with increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, in particular influenza. A pragmatic trial was conducted to examine whether a stress management intervention (SMI) could reduce psychological morbidity and enhance the antibody response to influenza vaccination in the elderly, and whether changes in immune response of SMI participants were associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity.
Forty-three elderly spousal carers of dementia patients and 27 non-carer controls were recruited. Sixteen carers were allocated to an 8-week SMI or a non-intervention condition (n = 27). The non-carers formed a no treatment, 'normal' comparison group. At the end of the SMI or its equivalent time period, all participants received an influenza vaccination. IgG antibody titres to the vaccine were measured 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-vaccine.
There was evidence of elevated distress in both carer groups compared with non-carer controls throughout the SMI period, but no between-group differences in salivary cortisol. Immune responses to the vaccine revealed that 50% of SMI carers, 7% of non-intervention carers and 29% of non-carer controls produced a four-fold increase in antibody titre.

332,12872205,Research on psychoimmunology.,"Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the immune system in the multifactorial pathogenesis of schizophrenia and other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Later, the role of immune mediators like cytokines became a source of main interest related to the process on inflammation in the CSM. In this article we report the results of our research on cytokines in a different groups of psychiatric patients following their clinical symptomatology and the course of diseases. In particular, we observed a prevalent type 1 cytokine profile in acute multiple sclerosis patients, while IL-10 production predominated in stable multiple sclerosis individuals. The modifications of cytokine profiles observed in schizophrenic patients suggests that clinical improvement is associated with a reduction in the inflammatory-like situation present in those not currently under treatment. Our data on Alzheimer's disease (AD) support the role of the inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of AD and reinforce the hypothesis that the neurodegenerative processes in the AD patients are associated with an abnormal antigen-specific immune response.

In particular, it has been shown that disruptions in the mother-infant relationship result in neuroendocrine, neurochemical and behavioural changes in the adult organism, although the basic mechanisms underlying such changes have not been completely elucidated. Recent data suggest that neurotrophins might be among the mediators capable of transducing the effects of external manipulations on brain development. Nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor are known to play a major role during brain development, while in the adult animal they are mainly responsible for the maintenance of neuronal function and structural integrity.

The circadian clock and its output melatonin rhythm is synchronized to the 24h day by environmental light which is transmitted from the retina to the SCN primarily via the retinohypothalamic tract. Changes in both the amplitude and timing of the melatonin rhythm have been reported with aging in humans. Whether these age-related changes (reduced melatonin amplitude, earlier timing of melatonin rhythm) are a result of aging of the retina, the SCN clock, the pineal gland, their neural connections or a combination of some or all of these is not known. The fragmented sleep/wake patterns observed in the elderly and to a greater extent in patients with Alzheimer's disease have been shown to be partly related to an altered retina-SCN-pineal axis. Therapies designed to reinforce the circadian axis (for example, administration of melatonin or light) have been reported to alleviate the disturbed circadian rhythms and disrupted sleep.

336,12408216,The effect of therapeutic touch on agitated behavior and cortisol in persons with Alzheimer's disease.,"Agitated behavior in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a challenge to current interventions. Recent developments in neuroendocrinology suggest that changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis alter the responses of persons with AD to stress. Given the deleterious effects of pharmacological interventions in this vulnerable population, it is essential to explore noninvasive treatments for their potential to decrease a hyperresponsiveness to stress and indirectly decrease detrimental cortisol levels. This within-subject, interrupted time-series study was conducted to test the efficacy of therapeutic touch on decreasing the frequency of agitated behavior and salivary and urine cortisol levels in persons with AD. Ten subjects who were 71 to 84 years old and resided in a special care unit were observed every 20 minutes for 10 hours a day, were monitored 24 hours a day for physical activity, and had samples for salivary and urine cortisol taken daily. The study occurred in 4 phases: 1) baseline (4 days), 2) treatment (therapeutic touch for 5 to 7 minutes 2 times a day for 3 days), 3) posttreatment (11 days), and 4) post- ""wash-out"" (3 days). An analysis of variance for repeated measures indicated a significant decrease in overall agitated behavior and in 2 specific behaviors, vocalization and pacing or walking, during treatment and posttreatment. A decreasing trend over time was notedfor salivary and urine cortisol. Although this study does not provide direct clinical evidence to support dysregulation in the HPA axis, it does suggest that environmental and behavioral interventions such as therapeutic touch have the potential to decrease vocalization and pacing, 2 prevalent behaviors, and may mitigate cortisol levels in persons with AD.",[],Biological research for nursing,2002-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Woods', 'firstname': 'Diana Lynn', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'College of Nursing at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA. woodsdianalynn@uams.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Dimond', 'firstname': 'Margaret', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1177/1099800402238331,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc4f60e0>

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a particularly powerful tool for quantifying the neurobiological correlates of cognition, mood and behavior. Initial PET studies of aging, psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disease focused primarily on generalized physiological parameters such as cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and early neuroreceptor imaging studies relied on relatively non selective markers. New, selective receptor radioligands now offer a previously inaccessible means to investigate the dynamic relationships among neurochemistry, aging and psychopathology in vivo. This approach has substantial advantages over peripheral (platelet and cerebrospinal fluid) markers, neuroendocrine challenge studies, animal models, and postmortem receptor binding assays. Advances in tracer kinetic modeling, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to PET registration, radiochemistry techniques, instrumentation and image processing have helped pave the way for increased emphasis on functional imaging studies of neuropsychiatric disorders of the elderly.

In addition, we find a significant increase in LH in the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons and neurofibrillary tangles of AD brain compared to age-matched control brain. Whereas the functional consequences of increased neuronal LH are unknown, it is notable that LH is primarily localized to those neurons that are known to be vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration.

The hypothesis of this study was that altered central serotonergic activity is related to aggression in AD. Twenty-two institutionalized, nondepressed elderly (12 M/10 F, mean age +/- SD: 82.2 +/- 6.4) with probable AD, severe cognitive impairment (MMSE = 4.1 +/- 4.7) and significant behavioral disturbance (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score > or = 8) were studied. The prolactin (PRL) response to d,l-fenfluramine (60 mg p.o.) was used as an index of central serotonergic function. The NPI aggression score, NPI irritability score, and Behavioral Pathology in AD aggression score were positively correlated to prolactin concentrations following fenfluramine challenge (r(S) =.61, p =.003; r(S) =.53, p =.012; and r(S) =.47, p =.029 respectively). In addition, aggressive patients showed a greater mean PRL increase (% baseline) (215 +/- 60, n = 11) than nonaggressive subjects (123 +/- 54, n = 11) (p =.01, 2-tailed t-test). The change in PRL concentration depended on level of cognitive impairment (p =.0004) and the gender x aggression interaction (p =.015) with the overall regression model accounting for 74% of the variance (r = 0.86, F = 11.9, p =.0001).

The 9 a.m. cortisol level of the MCI group was significantly lower than the 9 a.m. level of the young controls, but did not differ from those of the normal elderly group. In contrast to the other two groups, within the MCI group mean cortisol levels were inversely related to immediate recall of paragraphs. No association was observed between mean cortisol levels and performance in paired associates and digit span.

341,12127594,Immunological mechanisms and the spectrum of psychiatric syndromes in Alzheimer's disease.,"Pathological, genetic and epidemiological studies support the opinion that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent pathological and neuroradiological (PET) data show that activation of microglia is an early pathogenic event that precedes the process of severe neuropil destruction in AD brains. In this paper we review the evidence that inflammatory mediators can play a pathogenic role in some behavioural disorders frequently encountered during the clinical course in AD patients. Motivational disturbances are the most striking of the depressive symptoms in AD and can be present in a preclinical stage of the disease. Experimental animal studies and clinical trials in humans have shown that cytokines can induce similar symptoms which were described as 'sickness behaviour' or 'depressive-like' state. Delirious states are frequently observed in more advanced stages of dementia. Delirium is generally considered the result of an imbalance in neurotransmitter systems with severe deficits of the cholinergic systems. Animal studies show that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, induce a reduced activity of the cholinergic system. In AD, the release of cytokines would exacerbate any already existing disturbances in the cholinergic neurotransmission. This could explain the susceptibility of demented patients to delirium provoked by a wide variety of trivial incidents that are accompanied by an acute phase response. The data reviewed in this paper suggest that it could be worthwhile employing a neuroimmunological approach to study at molecular level the pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of behavioural disturbances common in the clinical course of AD patients.",[],Journal of psychiatric research,2002-07-20,"[{'lastname': 'Eikelenboom', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. piete@ggzba.nl'}, {'lastname': 'Hoogendijk', 'firstname': 'W J G', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jonker', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'van Tilburg', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0022-3956(02)00006-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc11b9f0>
342,12114299,Neurological and neuroendocrine-cytokine inter-relationship in the antiphospholipid syndrome.,"Although many neurological deficits have been described in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), only stroke is well established and accepted as a diagnostic criterion in the disease. We presently review clinical data obtained from large series of cases regarding stroke, dementia, epilepsy, chorea, migraine, white-matter disease, and behavioral changes in APS, or linked-to-laboratory criteria such as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). The contribution of animal models to our understanding of these manifestations of APS is stressed, especially regarding the cognitive and behavioral aspects for which we have established model systems in the mouse. These models utilize immunization of mice with beta(2)-glycoprotein1, a central autoantigen in APS, which induces persistent high levels of aPLs. These mice develop hyperactive behavior after a period of four months, as well as deficits in learning and memory, and are potentially valuable as a system in which to study the pathogenesis and treatment of cognitive and behavioral aspects of APS. We have developed another model, in which IgGs from APS patients induce depolarization of brain synaptoneurosomes, and which may serve as a model for the pathogenesis of epilepsy in APS. Hormonal changes are another potential CNS manifestation of APS and this may be potentially linked to the systemic and central effects of cytokines such as interleukin-3. Better understanding of the link between APS and neurological or neuroendocrine manifestations other than stroke will reveal whether they can be used as clinical criteria for the diagnosis of APS and, it is hoped, lead to better treatment.",[],Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2002-07-13,"[{'lastname': 'Chapman', 'firstname': 'Joab', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Neuroimmunology Service, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Shoenfeld', 'firstname': 'Yehuda', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04242.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc111270>

345,12064251,Prion diseases: epidemiology in man.,"Prion disease in man was first described as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in the 1920s. CJD may have three different origins: sporadic, familial, due to mutations in the prion gene, or infectious, due to iatrogenic exposure to infectious brain material. As an example of the latter, kuru, in Papua New Guinea, was a variant of CJD transmitted by cannibalism. Between 1957 and 1982 more than 2500 died of kuru. Sporadic CJD is the most common form of CJD and occurs with an incidence of around one per million in most parts of the world. Familial CJD accounts for approximately 10% of all European cases of CJD, and is associated with inherited mutations of the prion protein gene, caused by one of the 24 single amino acid substitutions or insertions of octapeptide repeats. CJD caused by infections involves either iatrogenic cases of CJD, resulting from exposure to infectious brain, pituitary or ocular tissue, or from ingestion of infected food items. As of today, a few hundred iatrogenic cases of CJD have been diagnosed worldwide, the majority due to transmission by cadaveric pituitary HCG. So far, 111 cases of vCJD have been diagnosed caused by BSE-contaminated food.

346,11911998,Mental deterioration correlates with response of natural killer (NK) cell activity to physiological modifiers in patients with short history of Alzheimer's disease.,"Natural killer (NK) cell activity of peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells was measured in 16 subjects with mild to moderate senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (sDAT) chosen for short history of disease and no medication, and in 17 age- and sex-matched controls. Levels of cytotoxicity at baseline and after PBM cell exposure to modifiers either negative (cortisol 10(-6) M) or positive (rIL-2 650 IU/ml and rIFN-gamma 100 UI/ml, respectively) were related to indices of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function and Gottfries Bråne Rating Scale (GBS) score for mental deterioration. Spontaneous NK cell activity was not significantly different in sDAT subjects vs controls. In vitro inhibition by cortisol was lower in sDAT (P<0.05); cytokine-induced changes were greater (rIL-2, P<0.02; rIFN-gamma, P<0.05). Percent negative or positive variations from baseline significantly correlated with GBS scores (P<0.05 or less). Serum cortisol and cortisol/DHEAS molar ratio at 0800 h were significantly higher in sDAT (P<0.05 and P<0.02, respectively). Cortisol/DHEA ratio positively correlated with GBS scores (P<0.02). Moreover, the ratios of incremental area of response ACTH/cortisol and beta-endorphin/cortisol after 1 microg/kg ovine-corticotrophin-releasing hormone (o-CRH) positively correlated with percent increase of NK cell activity after rIL-2 (P<0.01). Data indicate that patients with mild cognitive impairment and short history of sDAT show abnormal responsiveness of NK cell activity to physiological modifiers while maintaining normal spontaneous activity. Furthermore, data are compatible with partial glucocorticoid resistance at the immune level. Progressing sDAT longitudinal studies are needed to address: i) the clinical applicability of these abnormalities as prognostic factors; ii) the role played by pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides and adrenal androgens in the control of NK cell activity.",[],Psychoneuroendocrinology,2002-03-26,"[{'lastname': 'Masera', 'firstname': 'Rosa Gabriella', 'initials': 'RG', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Via Cherasco 11, 10126, Torino, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Prolo', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sartori', 'firstname': 'Maria Luisa', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Staurenghi', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Griot', 'firstname': 'Giulietta', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ravizza', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dovio', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chiappelli', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Angeli', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0306-4530(01)00062-2,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc0ea900>

The observation that IL-1 type I receptor was expressed in highest density in the hypothalamus was of significance in identifying a role for IL-1 beta in neuroendocrine modulation. However, the finding that receptor expression was also high in the hippocampus, an area of the brain which plays a pivotal role in memory and learning, has led to uncovering a role for IL-1 beta in cognitive function. There is now a great deal of evidence suggesting that IL-1 beta plays a significant role in hippocampal synaptic function, and the possibility that IL-1 beta may trigger some of the detrimental changes in certain neurodegenerative diseases is currently being assessed.

Genetic, environmental and neurophysiological aspects should all be taken into account. The disease has also neuroendocrine implications, some of which are discussed in this review. It is known that stress and glucocorticoids may affect neurone survival. On the contrary, some data indicate that DHEA and DHEAS exert a neuroprotective action. In AD, changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function have been reported. Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that glucocorticoid hypersecretion and DHEAS levels decrement may add to hippocampal dysfunction in aging and in AD. Glucocorticoid and beta-amyloid concur in the mechanism of neurone damage, as well as excitatory amino acids (EAA), Ca++ and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The neuroprotective effects exerted by IGFs are also hindered in aging and even more in AD.

Alterations in any one of these systems can have a profound effect on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression. Additionally, the recent discovery that amyloid beta 1-42 can induce the expression of CYP reductase in neuronal cultures further suggests that hepatic CYP-related metabolism may be affected by the expression of mutant human amyloid precursor protein in these tg(hAPP) mice. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the activity and protein content of several CYP isoforms in the livers and kidneys of aged (20-month-old) tg(hAPP) mice. tg(hAPP) mice exhibit significant elevations in hepatic CYP2B, CYP2E1-, CYP3A- and CYP4A-associated activities and CYP4A immunoreactive protein compared with wild-type. In contrast to the liver, a significant depression in renal CYP2E1- and CYP4A-associated activities were demonstrated in tg(hAPP) mice.

350,11744094,Age-related changes of the adrenal secretory pattern: possible role in pathological brain aging.,"The biosynthetic dissociation of the adrenocortical secretion occurring with age may have a pathogenetic role in the pathophysiology of brain aging. We studied cortisol and DHEAS secretion in healthy old and young subjects, in senile dementia, in major depression of elderly subjects and in healthy centenarians. A clear age-related decline of DHEAS secretion was well evident in healthy centenarians, and a further decrease in DHEAS concentration was found in old depressed patients and moreover in the demented ones, by comparison with age-matched controls. The circadian profile of serum cortisol was clearly flattened in old subjects, due to the selective increase in the cortisol nocturnal levels, particularly evident in demented subjects; on the other hand, the morning serum cortisol levels were not significantly different among centenarians, young and old controls. The molar ratio between cortisol and DHEAS showed a significant age-related increase; the occurrence of senile dementia and of major depression played an additive role, by comparison to physiological aging. The qualitative and quantitative modifications of the adrenocortical secretion occurring with aging seem mainly dependent on age itself, but the occurrence of pathological conditions may amplify these changes. Since cortisol and DHEAS play opposite effects on the central nervous system, the evaluation of the ratio between cortisol and DHEAS seems to be a good marker of the neuroendocrine features in old subjects.",[],Brain research.

During each visit, cognition was assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests, and blood samples were collected to measure plasma estradiol as well as several other neuroendocrine markers of interest.
Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention (Stroop Color Word Interference Test), verbal memory (Buschke Selective Reminding Test), and visual memory (Figure Copy/Memory). In addition, women treated with estrogen demonstrated improved performance on a test of semantic memory (Boston Naming Test) compared with subjects who received a placebo. Estrogen appeared to have a suppressive effect on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system such that plasma concentration of IGF binding protein-3 was significantly reduced and plasma levels of estradiol and IGF-I were negatively correlated during estrogen treatment.
Administration of a higher dose of estrogen may enhance attention and memory for postmenopausal women with AD. Although these findings provide further clinical evidence to support a cognitive benefit of estrogen for women with AD, studies evaluating the effect of estradiol administration, in particular, using larger sample sizes and for longer treatment durations are warranted before the therapeutic potential of estrogen replacement for women with AD can be firmly established.",[],Neurology,2001-08-29,"[{'lastname': 'Asthana', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle/Tacoma, Tacoma, WA 98493, USA. sasthana@u.washington.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Baker', 'firstname': 'L D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Craft', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stanczyk', 'firstname': 'F Z', 'initials': 'FZ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Veith', 'firstname': 'R C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Raskind', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Plymate', 'firstname': 'S R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention (Stroop Color Word Interference Test), verbal memory (Buschke Selective Reminding Test), and visual memory (Figure Copy/Memory).

356,11456467,Chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system.,"Chemokines are a family of proteins associated with the trafficking of leukocytes in physiological immune surveillance and inflammatory cell recruitment in host defence. They are classified into four classes based on the positions of key cystiene residues: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C. Chemokines act through both specific and shared receptors that all belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Besides their well-established role in the immune system, several recent reports have demonstrated that these proteins also play a role in the central nervous system (CNS). In the CNS, chemokines are constitutively expressed by microglial cells, astrocytes, and neurons, and their expression can be increased after induction with inflammatory mediators. Constitutive expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors has been observed in both developing and adult brains, and the role played by these proteins in the normal brain is the object of intense study by many research groups. Chemokines are involved in brain development and in the maintenance of normal brain homeostasis; these proteins play a role in the migration, differentiation, and proliferation of glial and neuronal cells. The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor, CXCR4, are essential for life during development, and this ligand-receptor pair has been shown to have a fundamental role in neuron migration during cerebellar formation. Chemokine and chemokine receptor expression can be increased by inflammatory mediators, and this has in turn been associated with several acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. In the CNS, chemokines play an essential role in neuroinflammation as mediators of leukocyte infiltration. Their overexpression has been implicated in different neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, tumor progression, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated dementia. An emerging area of interest for chemokine action is represented by the communication between the neuroendocrine and the immune system. Chemokines have hormone-like actions, specifically regulating the key host physiopathological responses of fever and appetite. It is now evident that chemokines and their receptors represent a plurifunctional family of proteins whose actions on the CNS are not restricted to neuroinflammation. These molecules constitute crucial regulators of cellular communication in physiological and developmental processes.",[],Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2001-07-18,"[{'lastname': 'Bajetto', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacology and Neuroscience National Institute for Cancer Research, Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bonavia', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barbero', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Florio', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schettini', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright 2001 Academic Press.,10.1006/frne.2001.0214,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d953f0e0>
357,11442356,Corticotropin-releasing hormone protects neurons against insults relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"We previously reported that mice over-expressing the human amyloid precursor protein gene with the double Swedish mutation of familial Alzheimer's disease (mtAPP), which exhibit progressive deposition of amyloid beta-peptide in hippocampal and cortical brain regions, have an impaired ability to maintain a sustained glucocorticoid response to stress. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), which initiates neuroendocrine responses to stress by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, is expressed in brain regions prone to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. We therefore tested the hypothesis that CRH can modify neuronal vulnerability to amyloid beta-peptide toxicity. In primary neuronal culture, CRH was protective against cell death caused by an amyloid-beta peptide, an effect that was blocked by a CRH receptor antagonist and by an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The increased resistance of CRH-treated neurons to amyloid toxicity was associated with stabilization of cellular calcium homeostasis. Moreover, CRH protected neurons against death caused by lipid peroxidation and the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate. The level of mRNA encoding CRH was unchanged in mtAPP mouse brain, whereas the levels of mRNAs encoding glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors were subtly altered. Our results suggest that disturbances in HPA axis function can occur independently of alterations in CRH mRNA levels in Alzheimer's disease brain and further suggest an additional role for CRH in protecting neurons against cell death.",[],Neurobiology of disease,2001-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Pedersen', 'firstname': 'W A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neurosciences, National Institute on Aging Gerontology Research Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McCullers', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Culmsee', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Haughey', 'firstname': 'N J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Herman', 'firstname': 'J P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mattson', 'firstname': 'M P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Copyright 2001 Academic Press.,10.1006/nbdi.2001.0395,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d95344a0>
358,11320185,Increased CSF cortisol in AD is a function of APOE genotype.,"Increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity manifested by elevated cortisol levels is observed in AD and may contribute to AD by lowering the threshold for neuronal degeneration. Presence of the APOE-epsilon4 allele increases risk for AD. Increased cortisol concentrations in apoE-deficient mice suggest that APOE genotype may influence cortisol concentrations in AD.
The authors measured cortisol levels in CSF and determined APOE genotypes for 64 subjects with AD and 34 nondemented older control subjects.
CSF cortisol was significantly higher in AD than in control subjects. CSF cortisol concentrations differed with respect to APOE genotype in both subjects with AD (epsilon4/epsilon4 > epsilon3/4epsilon > epsilon3/epsilon3) and normal older control subjects (epsilon3/epsilon4 > epsilon3/epsilon3 > epsilon2/epsilon3). Comparison of CSF cortisol concentrations within the epsilon3/epsilon4 and epsilon3/epsilon3 genotypes revealed no differences between AD and control subject groups.
Higher CSF cortisol concentrations were associated with increased frequency of the APOE-epsilon4 allele and decreased frequency of the APOE-epsilon2 allele in AD subjects relative to control subjects. This effect of APOE genotype on HPA axis activity may be related to the increased risk for AD in persons carrying the APOE-epsilon4 allele and decreased risk for AD in persons carrying the APOE-epsilon2 allele.",[],Neurology,2001-04-26,"[{'lastname': 'Peskind', 'firstname': 'E R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA. peskind.elaine@seattle.va.gov'}, {'lastname': 'Wilkinson', 'firstname': 'C W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petrie', 'firstname': 'E C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schellenberg', 'firstname': 'G D', 'initials': 'GD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Raskind', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,CSF cortisol was significantly higher in AD than in control subjects.

8917605","Relationships between cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and insulin-like growth factor-I system in dementia.","Changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) function, entailing elevated cortisol circulating titres, occur in aging and in some neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Excess cortisol has neurotoxic effects which affect hippocampal neurones. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) has an antiglucocorticoid activity and neuroprotective effects, but its levels decrease with aging. Glucocorticoids influence the production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and modify its systemic and neurotrophic biological activity by inducing changes in IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). We looked for relationships between cortisol, DHEAS levels, and IGF-I - IGFBPs system in AD. Cortisol, DHEAS and GH levels at 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, 20:00 h, basal IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were determined by RIAs or IRMA in 25 AD patients, aged 58-89 yr, and in 12 age-matched healthy controls. AD subjects had higher cortisol, lower DHEAS levels and increased cortisol/DHEAS ratio (C/Dr) than controls. In AD cases, total IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGF-I/IGFBP ratios were significantly lowered, while IGFBP-1 levels were significantly higher than in controls. We found a significant inverse correlation between IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels vs C/Dr, and between both IGF-I/IGFBPs ratios vs mean cortisol levels. IGFBP-3 correlated directly with DHEAS. Cortisol was directly and IGF-I inversely correlated with cognitive impairment. In AD patients we found that alterations in HPAA function and elevated C/Dr are related to lowered total and free IGF-I levels. These findings and their relationship to cognitive impairment suggest that changes in hormonal set-up might influence the clinical presentation of the disease.",[],Journal of endocrinological investigation,2001-04-21,"[{'lastname': 'Murialdo', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinological and Metabolic Sciences, Clinical Neurophysiology Service, University of Genova, Italy. disem@unige.it'}, {'lastname': 'Barreca', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nobili', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rollero', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Timossi', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gianelli', 'firstname': 'M V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Copello', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rodriguez', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Polleri', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/BF03343833,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d995f400>
360,11312139,Hormones and the hippocampus.,"Hippocampal lesions produce memory deficits, but the exact function of the hippocampus remains obscure. Evidence is presented that its role in memory may be ancillary to physiological regulation. Molecular studies demonstrate that the hippocampus is a primary target for ligands that reflect body physiology, including ion balance and blood pressure, immunity, pain, reproductive status, satiety and stress. Hippocampal receptors are functional, probably accessible to their ligands, and mediate physiological and cognitive changes. This argues that an early role of the hippocampus may have been in sensing soluble molecules (termed here 'enteroception') in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, perhaps reflecting a common evolutionary origin with the olfactory system ('exteroception'). Functionally, hippocampal enteroception may reflect feedback control; evidence is reviewed that the hippocampus modulates body physiology, including the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, blood pressure, immunity, and reproductive function. It is suggested that the hippocampus operates, in parallel with the amygdala, to modulate body physiology in response to cognitive stimuli. Hippocampal outputs are predominantly inhibitory on downstream neuroendocrine activity; increased synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus (e.g. long-term potentiation) could facilitate throughput inhibition. This may have implications for the role of the hippocampus and long-term potentiation in memory.",[],The Journal of endocrinology,2001-04-20,"[{'lastname': 'Lathe', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Genome Research and Centre for Neuroscience, University of Edinburgh, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, UK.'}]",,,,,10.1677/joe.0.1690205,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d99373b0>
361,11293840,[Increased activity of stress-regulating systems in Alzheimer disease].,"Behavioral, i.e. non-cognitive, disturbances, such as anxiety, agitation, sleep disturbances and depression occur in the majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but their neurobiological basis is unknown. Disturbance of stress regulating systems, like the locus coeruleus, could play an important role. The locus coeruleus, the main production site of noradrenaline in the central nervous system, is involved in phenomena like attention, arousal and the response to the environment. In Alzheimer's disease, there is a marked reduction of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. We studied the activity in the remaining locus coeruleus neurons and found an inverse relationship between the number of remaining neurons and the noradrenergic activity. This could indicate compensatory activity and loss of flexibility of this system. Clinically, the loss of flexibility could result in an impairment to focus attention and to respond to the environment. These results can be related to another stress related system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-(HPA)axis. This means that further evaluation of both of these systems is necessary.",[],Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,2001-04-11,"[{'lastname': 'Hoogendijk', 'firstname': 'W J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Vakgroep psychiatrie, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam/GGZ Buitenamstel, Valeriusplein 9, 1075 BG Amsterdam.'}, {'lastname': 'Meynen', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Feenstra', 'firstname': 'M G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Eikelenboom', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kamphorst', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Swaab', 'firstname': 'D F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9930d60>
362,11275940,Age-related changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis: pathophysiological correlates.,"The aim of this review was to examine the evidence for age-related changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in both physiological and pathological aging, on the basis of the many data in the literature, as well as of our personal findings. A statistically significant circadian rhythmicity of serum cortisol was maintained in elderly subjects, even if with a reduced amplitude of the 24 h fluctuations and a trend to an increase of the serum levels in the evening and at night-time, in comparison with young controls. Furthermore, an age-related impairment of HPA sensitivity to steroid feedback was present in elderly people. The occurrence of senile dementia amplified the changes already present in physiological aging. While the cortisol secretion was generally well maintained in aging, the adrenal production of dehydroepiandrosterone and of its sulfate (DHEAS) exhibited an age-related decline. Therefore, the cortisol/DHEAS molar ratio was significantly higher in elderly subjects and even more in demented ones, than in young controls. Due to the opposite effects of cortisol and DHEAS on the brain and particularly on the hippocampal region, the imbalance between glucocorticoids and androgens occurring in physiological and even more in pathological aging, may have adverse effects on the function of this region, whose key role in learning and memory is well known.",[],European journal of endocrinology,2001-03-29,"[{'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapeutics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. ferrari@unipv.it'}, {'lastname': 'Cravello', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Muzzoni', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Casarotti', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Paltro', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Solerte', 'firstname': 'S B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fioravanti', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cuzzoni', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pontiggia', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Magri', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1530/eje.0.1440319,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9927770>
363,11268387,Variability of interactions between neuroendocrine and immunological functions in physiological aging and dementia of the Alzheimer's type.,"A link between neuroendocrine and immunological changes has been suggested in the pathophysiology of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Healthy young and old subjects and patients with DAT were recruited to evaluate the chrononeuroendocrine organization of cortisol, GH, and melatonin (MLT) secretions. The study was carried out together with the evaluation of natural killer (NK) cell function: cytotoxic activity (NKCC) and TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma release after exposure to IL-2 (100 U/mL). Moreover, a cerebral morphometric analysis of hippocampus and temporal lobe (MRI) was performed. The activation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the decrease of GH, and MLT nocturnal peaks were associated with normal NKCC and TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma in healthy elderly subjects, whereas in DAT patients the same neuroendocrine changes occurred together with abnormal NKCC (spontaneous and IL-2/IFN-beta-modulated) and with alterations of TNF-alpha/INF-gamma generation from NK. Moreover significant correlations among the increase of NKCC and TNF-alpha and the decrease of cognitive function were found in the DAT group. These correlations were associated with the impairment of nocturnal GH and MLT levels and with the relatively higher serum cortisol concentrations. Moreover, the impairment of cortisol suppression after dexamethasone (1 mg orally at 23:00) was significantly correlated with the increase of spontaneous release of TNF-alpha and with IL-2-modulated NKCC. Finally the imunoneuroendocrine alterations found in DAT were associated with the reduction of cerebral volume in hippocampus and temporal lobes. Taken together these data indicate that the immunoneuroendocrine balance is maintained in physiological aging, whereas NK immune dysregulation in DAT could contribute to altering the neuroendocrine functions and to extend the progression of neurodegeneration and dementia.",[],Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2001-03-28,"[{'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Gerontology Clinic, Post-graduate School of Geriatrics and Endocrinology, University of Pavia, Piazza Borromeo 2, 27100 Pavia, Italy. ferrari@unipv.it'}, {'lastname': 'Fioravanti', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Magri', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Solerte', 'firstname': 'S B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb05424.x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05def025e0>

A significant increase of serum cortisol levels during evening- and night-times was found in elderly subjects, particularly if demented, when compared to young controls. Besides, both the circadian amplitude of cortisol rhythm and the nocturnal cortisol increase were significantly reduced in relation either to age or to cognitive impairment. By comparison to vascular dementia, patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibited the highest cortisol concentrations throughout the 24h. The sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to the steroid feedback was significantly impaired in old subjects and particularly in the demented ones. The serum DHEAS levels were significantly lower in elderly subjects and even more in demented patients than in young controls. Consequently, a significant increase of the cortisol/DHEAS molar ratio was evident when going from young controls to healthy elderly subjects and to demented patients.

367,11087961,Plasma catecholamine and cardiovascular responses to physostigmine in Alzheimer's disease and aging.,"Stimulation of brain cholinergic systems increases activity of both the sympathoneural (SN) and sympathoadrenomedullary (SAM) components of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Because presynaptic cholinergic neuron numbers are substantially reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we predicted decreased responsiveness in AD of plasma norepinephrine (NE), an estimate of SN activity, and of epinephrine (EPI), an estimate of SAM activity, to central cholinergic stimulation by the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.0125 mg/kg i.v.). Because previous studies have demonstrated that normal human aging increases SN activity but not SAM activity, we specifically hypothesized: (1) a smaller NE response to physostigmine in subjects with mild to moderate AD (n=11; age 72+/-2 yrs; mini-mental state exam [MMSE] scores of 19+/-2) than in healthy older subjects (n=20; age 71+/-1 yrs); and (2) a smaller EPI response in AD subjects than in either healthy older or healthy young subjects (n=9; age 27+/-2 yrs). Unexpectedly, the plasma NE increase following physostigmine only achieved significance in AD subjects and plasma EPI responses were greater in both AD and older subjects than in young subjects. Blood pressure responses to physostigmine were consistent with the catecholamine responses. These data suggest that the presence of mild to moderate AD increases the SN response to cholinergic stimulation and that both AD and normal aging increase the SAM response to cholinergic stimulation. As a result, plasma catecholamine responses to physostigmine do not appear to be useful peripheral neuroendocrine estimates of the severity of brain cholinergic deficits in mild to moderate AD.",[],Psychoneuroendocrinology,2000-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Petrie', 'firstname': 'E C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': 'Mental Health Service (S-116), Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, 1660 S.

368,11062474,Mutant WD-repeat protein in triple-A syndrome.,"Triple-A syndrome (MIM 231550; also known as Allgrove syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia of the oesophageal cardia and alacrima. Whereas several lines of evidence indicate that triple-A syndrome results from the abnormal development of the autonomic nervous system, late-onset progressive neurological symptoms (including cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and mild dementia) suggest that the central nervous system may be involved in the disease as well. Using fine-mapping based on linkage disequilibrium in North African inbred families, we identified a short ancestral haplotype on chromosome 12q13 (<1 cM), sequenced a BAC contig encompassing the triple-A minimal region and identified a novel gene (AAAS) encoding a protein of 547 amino acids that is mutant in affected individuals. We found five homozygous truncating mutations in unrelated patients and ascribed the founder effect in North African families to a single splice-donor site mutation that occurred more than 2,400 years ago. The predicted product of AAAS, ALADIN (for alacrima-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder), belongs to the WD-repeat family of regulatory proteins, indicating a new disease mechanism involved in triple-A syndrome. The expression of the gene in both neuroendocrine and cerebral structures points to a role in the normal development of the peripheral and central nervous systems.",[],Nature genetics,2000-11-04,"[{'lastname': 'Tullio-Pelet', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Unité de Recherches sur les Handicaps Génétiques de l'Enfant INSERM U-393, Paris, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Salomon', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hadj-Rabia', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mugnier', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de Laet', 'firstname': 'M H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chaouachi', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bakiri', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brottier', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cattolico', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Penet', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bégeot', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Naville', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nicolino', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chaussain', 'firstname': 'J L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Weissenbach', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Munnich', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lyonnet', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1038/81642,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05def0cf40>

Measures were taken before (low acute stress) and in response to brief laboratory stressors (high acute stress). We replicated prior research showing that caregivers report greater stress, depression, and loneliness than the comparison groups, and acute stressors elevate autonomic and neuroendocrine activity. We also found that caregivers, relative to noncaregivers, exhibited shorter preejection periods and elevated blood pressure and heart rate, but the magnitude of autonomic and neuroendocrine reactivity to the experimental stressors was comparable across these groups. This pattern of autonomic differentiation replicates prior research showing that caregivers are characterized by higher sympathetic activation than noncaregivers and suggests that the effects of chronic stress on physiological reactivity may be a less robust effect in older adults.",[],Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,2000-08-30,"[{'lastname': 'Cacioppo', 'firstname': 'J T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Burleson', 'firstname': 'M H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Poehlmann', 'firstname': 'K M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Malarkey', 'firstname': 'W B', 'initials': 'WB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kiecolt-Glaser', 'firstname': 'J K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Berntson', 'firstname': 'G G', 'initials': 'GG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Uchino', 'firstname': 'B N', 'initials': 'BN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Glaser', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/BF02895778,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05deef29a0>
370,10924668,Hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical and sympathetic nervous system responses to the cold pressor test in Alzheimer's disease.,"Increased basal activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis has been repeatedly demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and some studies suggest increased basal activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in this disorder; however, the effects of AD on HPA axis or SNS responses to a standardized aversive stressor have not been examined. The neuroendocrine response to aversive stress may be relevant to the pathophysiology of AD.
Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine responses to a 1-min cold pressor test (CPT) were measured in nine medically healthy AD outpatients (age 76 +/- 2 years) and nine age- and gender-matched medically healthy cognitively normal older subjects (age 76 +/- 1 year).
The cortisol response to CPT was increased in the AD group but the ACTH response did not differ between groups. Basal NE concentrations were higher in the AD group. Although NE responses to CPT did not differ between groups, the blood pressure response to CPT was higher in the AD subjects.
These results suggest increased HPA axis responsiveness to CPT at the level of the adrenal cortex in AD. The results also suggest increased basal sympathoneural activity and increased cardiovascular responsiveness to sympathoneural stimulation in AD under the conditions of this experimental protocol. Increased SNS stimulatory modulation of the adrenal cortex is a possible mechanism contributing to the observed enhanced cortisol response to CPT in these AD subjects.",[],Biological psychiatry,2000-08-05,"[{'lastname': 'Pascualy', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrie', 'firstname': 'E C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brodkin', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Peskind', 'firstname': 'E R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wilkinson', 'firstname': 'C W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Raskind', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The cortisol response to CPT was increased in the AD group but the ACTH response did not differ between groups.

7953712",Human immunodeficiency virus glycoprotein 160 induces cytokine mRNA expression in the rat central nervous system.,"1. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines within the central nervous system (CNS) of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may contribute to altered CNS processes prior to the onset of AIDS. Most studies of HIV-induced alterations in cytokine expression within the CNS have focused on interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). 2. We used a ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) to elucidate further the pattern of cytokine mRNA expression in the rat CNS in response to HIV envelope glycoprotein 160 (gp160). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically implanted with a guide cannula directed into a lateral cerebral ventricle. HIV gp160 was injected intracerebroventricularly and rats were sacrificed immediately (time = 0) or at 1, 2, or 4 hr postinjection. Discrete brain regions were dissected, and peripheral glands removed. All tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction and assay. 3. IL-1beta IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, and TNFbeta mRNAs were constitutively expressed in brain tissues. Central administration of gp160 dramatically increased mRNA expression for IL-1beta and TNFalpha in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum. Furthermore, although mRNA expression for IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 was never detected under basal conditions, these mRNAs were increased in brain tissue after administration of gp160. Peak expression in each brain region was detected 2 hr after administration. Multiple cytokine mRNAs were detected in peripheral tissues, but their expression was not altered by central administration of gp160. 4. Our results indicate that gp160 induces mRNA expression in brain for cytokines other than IL-1 and TNF. Screening for multiple cytokine mRNA in this manner provides extensive information concerning the particular cytokines that may be involved in HIV-induced pathologies and alterations in CNS processes.",[],Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2000-07-20,"[{'lastname': 'Gemma', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0431, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'E M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hughes', 'firstname': 'T K', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Opp', 'firstname': 'M R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1023/a:1007053129686,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dee23590>

The former includes the central aspects of acute-phase response with fever, altered food and water intake, sleepiness, sickness behaviour and neuroendocrine changes. Apart from stress response triggered by immune-inflammatory stimuli, the concept that IL-1 mediates other types of stress is also reviewed, showing that the cytokine may have a role in mediating hypothalamic responses to restrain stress and nociceptive stimuli. The days-to-years time-frame includes several CNS disorders accompanied by inappropriate and/or sustainedly elevated IL-beta production: ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease, HIV-related dementia and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-multiple sclerosis. In all cases, IL-beta is not envisioned as an aetiological factor, but it contributes significantly to the maintenance of disease state. Current and perspective therapeutic approaches involving the modulation of IL-beta production and effects are briefly discussed.",[],Therapie,2000-06-22,"[{'lastname': 'Tringali', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pharmacology, Catholic University Medical School, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Dello Russo', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Preziosi', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Navarra', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dee02130>
374,10841214,Supplementary administration of artificial bright light and melatonin as potent treatment for disorganized circadian rest-activity and dysfunctional autonomic and neuroendocrine systems in institutionalized demented elderly persons.,"Increased daytime napping, early morning awakening, frequent nocturnal sleep interruptions, and lowered amplitude and phase advance of the circadian sleep-wake rhythm are characteristic features of sleep-waking and chronobiological changes associated with aging. Especially in elderly patients with dementia, severely fragmented sleep-waking patterns are observed frequently and are associated with disorganized circadian rhythm of various physiological functions. Functional and/or organic deterioration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), decreased exposure to time cues such as insufficient social interaction and reduced environmental light, lowered sensitivity of sensory organs to time cues, and reduced ability of peripheral effector organs to express circadian rhythms may cause these chronobiological changes. In many cases of dementia, the usual treatments for insomnia do not work well, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern for health care practitioner and researchers. Recent therapeutical trials of supplementary administration of artificial bright light and the pineal hormone melatonin, a potent synchronizer for mammalian circadian rhythm, have indicated that these treatments are useful tools for demented elderly insomniacs. Both bright light and melatonin simultaneously ameliorate disorganized thermoregulatory and neuroendocrine systems associated with disrupted sleep-waking times, suggesting a new, potent therapeutic means for insomnia in the demented elderly. Future studies should address the most effective therapeutic design and the most suitable types of symptoms for treatment and investigate the use of these tools in preventive applications in persons in early stages of dementia.",[],Chronobiology international,2000-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Mishima', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Akita University School of Medicine, Akita-city, Japan. mishima@psy.med.akita-u.ac.jp'}, {'lastname': 'Okawa', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hozumi', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hishikawa', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1081/cbi-100101055,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dedfaef0>
375,10841205,Circadian rhythms and sleep in human aging.,"This issue of Chronobiology International is dedicated to the age-related changes in circadian rhythms as they occur in humans. It seems timely to give an overview of the knowledge and hypotheses on these changes now that we enter a century in which the number and percentage of elderly in the population will be unprecedented. Although we should take care not to follow the current tendency to think of old age as a disease--ignoring the fine aspects of being old--there is definitely an age-related increase in the risk of a number of conditions that are at least uncomfortable. Circadian rhythms have been attributed adaptive values that usually go unnoticed, but can surface painfully clear when derangements occur. Alterations in the regulation of circadian rhythms are thought to contribute to the symptoms of a number of conditions for which the risk is increased in old age (e.g., sleep disturbances, dementia, and depression). A multidisciplinary approach to investigate the mechanisms of age-related changes in circadian regulation eventually may result in treatment strategies that will improve the quality of life of the growing number of elderly. Although diverse topics are addressed in this issue, the possible mechanisms by which a deranged circadian timing system may be involved in sleep disturbances receives the most attention. This seems appropriate in view of the numerous studies that have addressed this relation in the last decade and also because of the high frequency and strong impact of sleep disturbances in the elderly. This introduction to the special issue first briefly addresses the impact of disturbed sleep in the elderly to show that the development of therapeutic methods other than the currently available pharmacological treatments should be given high priority. I believe that chronobiological insights may play an important role in the development of rational therapeutical methods.",[],Chronobiology international,2000-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Van Someren', 'firstname': 'E J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'Netherlands Institute for Brain Research, Amsterdam. e.van.someren@nih.knaw.nl'}]",,,,,10.1081/cbi-100101046,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dedf0770>

The cerebral morphometric analysis was performed in some subjects of the three groups by MRI. A significant increase in cortisol levels during evening and nighttime was found in both groups of the aged subjects. In elderly subjects, particularly if demented, the mean serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAs) levels throughout the 24-hour cycle were significantly lower than in young controls. A significant reduction of the hippocampal and temporal volume and an enlargement of the lateral ventricles were found in aged subjects, these changes being significantly related to subjects' age. Moreover, the hippocampal volume was positively correlated with the circadian mesor of DHEAs (i.e., the circadian rhythm adjusted mean) and with the cortisol nocturnal increase. Our data may suggest the existence of a link between the selective impairment of cortisol secretion and DHEAs levels, and the progression of hippocampal degeneration.",[],Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,2000-03-08,"[{'lastname': 'Magri', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, Chair of Geriatrics, University of Pavia, Italy. ferrari@ipv36.unipv.it'}, {'lastname': 'Terenzi', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ricciardi', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fioravanti', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Solerte', 'firstname': 'S B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stabile', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Balza', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gandini', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Villa', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"Copyright 2000 S.

The mechanisms responsible for these alterations and their possible contributions to the neurodegenerative process in AD are unknown. We now report that transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) that causes inherited early-onset AD exhibit increased sensitivity to physiological stressors, which is associated with aberrancies in HPA function and regulation of blood glucose levels. Specifically, APP mutant mice exhibit severe hypoglycemia and death following food restriction, and sustained elevations of plasma glucocorticoid levels and hypoglycemia following restraint stress. The alterations in HPA function and glucose regulation were evident in relatively young mice prior to overt deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta). However, diffuse accumulations of A beta were present in the hypothalamus of older mice, suggesting a role for soluble forms of A beta in dysregulation of HPA function. Our data demonstrate disturbances in neuroendocrine function in APP mutant mice similar to those seen in AD patients. These impairments in stress response, glucocorticoid signaling, and regulation of blood glucose should be considered in interpretations of data from past and future studies of APP mutant mice.",[],Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,2000-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Pedersen', 'firstname': 'W A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Sanders-Brown Research Center on Aging, University of Kentucky, Lexington 40536, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Culmsee', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ziegler', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Herman', 'firstname': 'J P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mattson', 'firstname': 'M P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1385/JMN:13:1-2:159,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df487130>

In view of the adverse effects of distress on cellular immune function, such distress may have implications for health. Indeed, it has been proposed that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a potential psychobiological mediator of these effects. In this study, we observed that elderly caregivers experienced greater distress and increased salivary cortisol than non-caregivers. In addition, caregivers had blunted mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, lower mitogen-induced IL-2 production, and reduced lymphocyte sensitivity to glucocorticoids.

1671880",[Psychoimmunology: a questionable model?].,"The concept of ""psychoimmunology"" that had long been supported by clinical observation and common sense, has acquired a sound scientific basis in the last two decades. The discovery of neuro-mediators and cytokines and their receptors shared by the central nervous system and the immune system has prompted research work using reliable methodologies to study the relationship between a 'hard' scientific field, such as immunology, and a 'soft' one, such as the behavioral sciences.
The complexity of the studies on stress and immunity lies upon the choice of immunological measurements and the development of reproducible stress protocols. Models of stress in experimental animals may address acute versus chronic stress, and individual versus social stress. In humans, typical situations such as academic exams, and care given to patients with dementia, for instance, have been chosen to study large groups of subjects. The development of self-questionnaires for a reliable evaluation of stress and its consequences has led to more accurate measurements of psychosocial events. In animals, acute stress usually drives the immune response towards a Th2, grossly 'immunosuppressive,' profile. In humans, acute stress associates an endocrine response (characterized by glucocorticoid secretion and hyperprolectinemia) with an immunosuppression. Chronic stress is more likely to induce a range of effects, depending on the capacity of the subject to cope with stress, and on his/her social environment. Among the numerous mediators of the hypothalamo-pituitary cascade, Corticotropin Releasing Hormone is a key factor in the stress-immunity relationship. Several studies in humans have demonstrated the influence of stress on the susceptibility to infections (including HIV infection) and on survival in malignant diseases. In autoimmune diseases, a high prevalence of depression, as well as a particular sensitivity to stressful events, seem to modify the course of conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rhumatoid arthritis or Sjögren's disease. The relationship between stress and diseases is based on the pathogenic model which involves the following chain of events: stressor, reaction to stress, neuro-endocrine changes, abnormalities of the immune response, and occurrence (or aggravation) of a disease. The evolution from health to disease could be associated, at least partially, with a 'passive' immunosuppressive mode of response, mediated by the pituitary-adrenal axis, typically the opposite of an 'active,' immunostimulant mode of response, mediated by adrenergic stimulation.
Concept-related problems still remain to be solved: adaptation to stress ('coping'), is both genetically and socially mediated; the significance and interpretation of stress-related abnormalities and their precise involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases may be ambiguous. However, available epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence is currently sufficient to allow physicians in their everyday practice to take stress and depression into account in order to markedly improve the prognosis of many diseases related to immune responses. Prospective studies of neuropsychological intervention, using either pharmacologic or behavioral approaches, should be made to provide the necessary rational to a psychoimmunological management of patients.
Les progrès considérables effectués depuis une vingtaine d'années ont permis d'aborder « scientifiquementle concept de psycho-immunologie, sous-tendu de longue date par le bon sens populaire et l'observation clinique. La découverte des neuromédiateurs et des cytokines, dont les récepteurs sont présents dans le système nerveux central et les cellules du système immunitaire, a permis le développement de travaux de recherche utilisant des méthodologies validées pour étudier les interfaces entre une science « dure , l'immunologie, et des sciences considérées comme « floues , les sciences du comportement.
La complexité de ces études réside à la fois dans le choix des dosages immunologiques et dans la mise au point de protocoles de stress reproductibles. Les modèles de stress animaux opposent classiquement le stress chronique au stress aigu, les stress individuels aux stress sociaux. Chez l'homme, certaines situations stressantes permettent le suivi de cohortes homogènes (stress des examens, conjoint de déments…). La méthode d'évaluation par des autoquestionnaires est également bien standardisée. Chez l'animal, un stress aigu oriente globalement la réponse immunitaire vers un profil «Th 2immunosuppresseur. Chez l'homme, le stress aigu associe une réponse endocrinienne (hypercorticisme et hyperprolactinémie) à une immunodépression. Les effets d'un stress chronique sont beaucoup moins univoques, et dépendent plus étroitement de l'ajustement du sujet au stress (

384,10399774,"Cognitive and neuroendocrine response to transdermal estrogen in postmenopausal women with Alzheimer's disease: results of a placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study.","Preliminary evidence from clinical studies indicates that treatment with estrogen augments cognitive function for women with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurobiology of estrogen, particularly its neuromodulatory and neuroprotective actions, provide a viable basis to support such cognition-enhancing effects. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design pilot clinical study to evaluate the cognitive and neuroendocrine response to estrogen administration for postmenopausal women with AD. Twelve women with probably AD of mild-moderate severity completed the study. During an eight week treatment period, six women received 0.05 mg/day dosage of 17 beta-estradiol via a skin patch and the remaining six wore a placebo skin patch. Subjects were randomized to equal distribution, and evaluated at baseline, at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8 on treatment, and at weeks 9, 10, 11, and 13 off treatment. On each day of evaluation, cognition was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests, and blood samples were collected to measure plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone. In addition, several neuroendocrine markers were measured in plasma to evaluate the relationship between estrogen-induced cognitive effects and fluctuations in the catecholaminergic and insulin-like growth factor systems. Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention (i.e. Stroop: number of self-corrections in the Interference condition, F[1,8] = 8.22, P < 0.03) and verbal memory (i.e., Buschke: delayed cued recall, F[3,30] = 4.31, P < 0.02). The salutary effects of estrogen on cognition were observed after the first week of treatment, and started to diminish when treatment was terminated. For women treated with estrogen, enhancement in verbal memory was positively correlated with plasma levels of estradiol (r = 0.96, P < 0.02) and negatively correlated with concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in plasma (r = -0.92, P < 0.03). Furthermore, a trend in the data was evident to suggest a negative relationship between plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and verbal memory (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). Estrogen administration suppressed peripheral markers of the IGF system, as evidenced by a negative correlation between plasma concentration of estradiol and IGF-1 (r = -0.93, P < 0.03), and a trend for a similar relationship between plasma levels of estradiol and IGFBP-3 (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). With respect to the catecholamines assayed, norepinephrine was positively correlated with verbal memory (r = 0.95, P < 0.02) for women who were treated with estrogen. Furthermore, there was a trend to suggest a negative relationship between plasma epinephrine levels and the number of errors committed on a test of attention (r = -0.84, P = 0.07). In the placebo group, no significant effects of estrogen replacement were evident either on measures of cognition or on any of the neuroendocrine markers. The results of this study suggest that estrogen replacement may enhance cognition for postmenopausal women with AD. Furthermore, several markers of neuroendocrine activity may serve to index the magnitude of estrogen-induced facilitation on cognition. In addition, research findings from the present study will provide important information for the design of larger prospective clinical studies that are essential to definitively establish the therapeutic role of estrogen replacement for postmenopausal women with AD.",[],Psychoneuroendocrinology,1999-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Asthana', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, American Lake Division, Tacoma, WA 98493, USA. sasthana@u.washington.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Craft', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Baker', 'firstname': 'L D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Raskind', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Birnbaum', 'firstname': 'R S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lofgreen', 'firstname': 'C P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Veith', 'firstname': 'R C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Plymate', 'firstname': 'S R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0306-4530(99)00020-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05def84ef0>
385,10372954,Neuroendocrine responses to intravenous infusion of physostigmine in patients with Alzheimer disease.,"We have reported that physostigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, enhances verbal memory in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). To elucidate the mechanism of cognition enhancement, plasma hormones were measured during high-dose acute and low-dose chronic steady-state intravenous infusions of physostigmine in nine subjects with AD. High-dose hormone responses were measured during and for 24 h after the infusion of physostigmine 1-1.5 mg over 45-60 min. Chronic responses were measured during continuous intravenous infusions of physostigmine at doses (0.5-25 mg/day) that escalated over 2 weeks, and then during 1 week infusion of the dose that optimized cognition (2-12 mg/day) or placebo administered in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. A replicable improvement in verbal memory was found in five subjects. High-dose physostigmine infusion that produced noxious side effects resulted in significant elevation above baseline in plasma levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (p = 0.0001), cortisol (p = 0.0001), and beta-endorphin (p = 0.0001). Chronic physostigmine administration, in the absence of adverse effects, produced no significant elevation in ACTH (p = 0.08), cortisol (p = 0.70), or beta-endorphin (p = 0.82). These results indicate that high-dose physostigmine activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, likely representing a ""stress response."" In contrast, cognition-enhancing doses do not produce a peripheral corticosteroid response. Thus, physostigmine-induced memory improvement is independent of the activation of the HPA axis.",[],Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,1999-06-18,"[{'lastname': 'Asthana', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neurosciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Raffaele', 'firstname': 'K C', 'initials': 'KC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Greig', 'firstname': 'N H', 'initials': 'NH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schapiro', 'firstname': 'M B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Blackman', 'firstname': 'M R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Soncrant', 'firstname': 'T T', 'initials': 'TT', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/00002093-199904000-00008,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05def76860>

Elderly normal subjects had larger peak cortisol and ACTH responses than AD patients. These results contrast with some previous reports of increased HPA-axis responsivity associated with AD and suggest that AD-related changes in HPA responsiveness depend on the type of stressor involved and are mediated 'upstream' to the final common pathway to ACTH secretion.

387,10227002,Menopause and the central nervous system: intervention options.,"The central nervous system is an important target for sex steroid hormones. During the climateric period the rapid decline of gonadal steroids causes neuroendocrine changes in different areas of the brain. The failure of gonadal hormone production brings specific symptoms due to the central nervous system derangement. At the hypotalamic level estrogen withdrawal gives rise to vasomotor symptoms, eating behavior disorders and altered blood pressure control. Psychological disturbances such as depression, anxiety, irritability and mood fluctuation are related to estrogen-induced changes in the lymbic system. The hypothesis of specific neuroanatomical and neurophysiological effects of estrogen on the brain may also explain the correlation between estrogen deficiency and cognitive disturbances such as Alzheimer's type dementia (AD). The increasing interest in the influence of sex steroids on brain function has focused attention on hormonal replacement therapy. Clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that estrogen therapy exerts a positive effect on vasomotor instability and improves psychological disturbances. The positive effects of estrogen on mood are probably related to its stimulatory action on adrenergic and serotoninergic tone. Estrogen may influence the cognitive function through different biological actions. Estrogen administration increases total cerebral and cerebellar blood flow, cerebral glucose administration and improves cholinergic tone, a key neurotransmitter in learning and memory. The evidence suggests that hormone replacement therapy may reduce the relative risk of developing AD. Progestagens and androgen may also have a role in the control of mood disorders. At present, few data are available regarding the influence that selective estrogen receptor modulators, a new class of compounds, can exert on the brain.",[],Maturitas,1999-05-05,"[{'lastname': 'Genazzani', 'firstname': 'A R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Spinetti', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gallo', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bernardi', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0378-5122(98)00112-1,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddd91360>

H.SemaIV was originally isolated from a homozygously deleted region involving a subset of small cell lung cancers, a neuroendocrine derived neoplasm. To investigate H.SemaIV expression, specific polyclonal antibodies directed against a unique polypeptide (amino acids 758-773) were developed and their specificity confirmed. In cell lines, H.SemaIV staining was observed in cytoplasmic granules. In the normal adult human brain, we noted three general characteristics of H.SemaIV expression. H.SemaIV was strongly present in specific nuclei or in neuronal regions arranged in defined subnuclear structures. It was also present in neurons but not glial cells or ependymocytes. Lastly, H.SemaIV was not present in cell bodies, but rather in fibers and nerve terminals.

389,10030328,Chronic stress in elderly carers of dementia patients and antibody response to influenza vaccination.,"There are many reports of psychological morbidity in spousal carers of patients with dementia. The consequences of this increased stress on the immune system are unclear. We investigated whether antibody responses to influenza vaccination differed between carers and a control group, and the relation of the antibody response to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
50 spousal carers of dementia patients, median age 73 years (IQR 66-77), and 67 controls (68 years [66-71]) of similar socioeconomic status were enrolled. Anxiety and depression were measured by the Savage Aged Personality Screening Scale and stress by the Global Measure of Perceived Stress scale. Principal-component analysis was used to yield a summary score of emotional distress from these two scales. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured over a single day at three times (0800-1000, 1100-1300, and 2000-2200). Participants received a trivalent influenza vaccine and IgG antibody titres to each strain were measured on days 0, 7, 14, and 28.
Mean scores of emotional distress were significantly higher in carers at each time point than in controls (all p<0.0003). Mean (SD) salivary cortisol concentrations, calculated as area under the curve (AUC), were higher in carers than controls at all three assessments (6 months 16.0 [8.0] vs 11.2 [4.4], p=0.0001; respectively). Eight (16%) of 50 carers and 26 (39%) of 67 controls had a four-fold increase in at least one of the IgG titres (p=0.007). There was an inverse relation between AUC cortisol and IgG antibody titre to the Nanchang strain that was significant on day 14 (r=-0.216, p=0.039).
Elderly carers of spouses with dementia have increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a poor antibody response to influenza vaccine.

8544946",Detrimental effects of chronic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. From obesity to memory deficits.,"Increasing evidence suggests that the detrimental effects of glucocorticoid (GC) hypersecretion occur by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in several human pathologies, including obesity, Alzheimer's disease, AIDS dementia, and depression. The different patterns of response by the HPA axis during chronic activation are an important consideration in selecting an animal model to assess HPA axis function in a particular disorder. This article will discuss how chronic HPA axis activation and GC hypersecretion affect hippocampal function and contribute to the development of obesity. In the brain, the hippocampus has the highest concentration of GC receptors. Chronic stress or corticosterone treatment induces neuropathological alterations, such as dendritic atrophy in hippocampal neurons, which are paralleled by cognitive deficits. Excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmission has been implicated in chronic HPA axis activation. EAAs play a major role in neuroendocrine regulation. Hippocampal dendritic atrophy may involve alterations in EAA transporter function, and decreased EAA transporter function may also contribute to chronic HPA axis activation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of HPA axis activation will likely advance the development of therapeutic interventions for conditions in which GC levels are chronically elevated.",[],Molecular neurobiology,1998-11-24,"[{'lastname': 'Raber', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Gladstone Institute of Neurological Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94141-9100, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1007/BF02741457,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddd79900>
391,9778574,Glucose transporter expression in brain: relationship to cerebral glucose utilization.,"Glucose is the principle energy source for mammalian brain. Delivery of glucose from the blood to the brain requires its transport across the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier and across the plasma membranes of neurons and glia, which is mediated by the facilitative glucose transporter proteins. The two primary glucose transporter isoforms which function in cerebral glucose metabolism are GLUT1 and GLUT3. GLUT1 is the primary transporter in the blood-brain barrier, choroid plexus, ependyma, and glia; GLUT3 is the neuronal glucose transporter. The levels of expression of both transporters are regulated in concert with metabolic demand and regional rates of cerebral glucose utilization. We present several experimental paradigms in which alterations in energetic demand and/or substrate supply affect glucose transporter expression. These include normal cerebral development in the rat, Alzheimer's disease, neuronal differentiation in vitro, and dehydration in the rat.",[],Developmental neuroscience,1998-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Vannucci', 'firstname': 'S J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Milton S.

392,9769665,"[Gamma aminobutyric acid--its function, disorders and their sequelae].","Gama-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important neurotransmitter that mediates inhibition in the central nervous system. Approximately 30-50% of all synapses are defined as GABA-ergic. GABA is a neurotransmitter in cortical and hippocampal interneurones. GABA-RECEPTORS: Till today, three receptor subtypes have been known: GABAA, GABAB and GABAC, which are pharmacologically different. GABAA receptor is postsynaptic and localized in central and peripheral sympathetic neurones. Its agonist is muscimol and is antagonized by bicucculline. GABAB is a presynaptic receptor of vegetative and central nerve terminals. Its agonist is baclofen. The main difference between these two subtypes is that the first one acts directly on Cl ionphore, while GABAB activity is mediated by Gi protein. GABAC receptors are the integral part of the membrane, which stabilise the resting potential of the cell by increasing conductivity for Cl. Their most effective agonist is TACA. GABA ACTIVITY ON SYNAPSES: GABA is the most powerful inhibitory neurotransmitter in CNS. Synaptic inhibition decreases cell's ability to communicate with other cells and it is realised by various inhibitory mechanism of GABA, such as preventing of stimuluss generation, dendritic inhibition and dendro-dendritic inhibition. GABA AND NEUROENDOCRINE REGULATION: Besides physiological significance in maintaining regular excitation and inhibition balance. GABA plays an important role in neuroendocrine regulation of the following hormones: LH, FSH, PRL, STH, SS, ACTH, TSH, TRH, MSH, VP and OX. GABA IN NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES: Increasing or decreasing of GABA-ergic tone, due to different reasons, may lead to numerous neurodegenerative disorders (epilepsy, hepatic encephalopathy, Huntington's chorea, spinocerebellar degeneration, dementia and psychosis).",[],Medicinski pregled,1998-10-14,"[{'lastname': 'De Luka', 'firstname': 'S R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Institut za medicinksa istrazivanja, Medicinsti fakultet, Beograd.'}, {'lastname': 'Protić', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vrbaski', 'firstname': 'S R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df363540>
393,9718269,Effects of memantine alone and with acute 'binge' cocaine on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in the rat.,"The effects of memantine, a non-competitive NMDA-receptor antagonist used in the management of dementia, and its coadministration with acute 'binge' pattern cocaine on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity were investigated in the rat. Measurements 3 h after injections showed that memantine alone at 20 mg kg(-1) (i.p.), but not 10 mg kg(-1), increased corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and both adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone levels in the blood, and decreased type I CRF receptor mRNA in the anterior pituitary. Our previous studies have shown that acute 'binge' cocaine increases CRF mRNA levels in the hypothalamus. In this study, pretreatment with memantine (10 and 20 mg kg(-1), i.p.) did not alter the up-regulation of hypothalamic CRF mRNA induced by acute 'binge' cocaine (3 x 15 mg kg(-1), i.p.). Of interest, pretreatment with memantine at 10 mg kg(-1), which alone had no effect on corticosterone levels, caused a greater elevation of corticosterone levels in combination with 'binge' cocaine than acute 'binge' cocaine alone, indicating that memantine does not attenuate 'binge' cocaine-stimulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity. These results indicate that both memantine and acute 'binge' cocaine stimulate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity by activating CRF neurons in the hypothalamus.",[],European journal of pharmacology,1998-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'The Laboratory of the Biology of Addictive Diseases, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuferov', 'firstname': 'V P', 'initials': 'VP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Spangler', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maggos', 'firstname': 'C E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ho', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kreek', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0014-2999(98)00332-x,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de9f57c0>

Neuropeptides and neurotransmitters such as opioid peptides, serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine secreted within the central nervous system also plays significant role in the patho-physiology of menopausal symptoms. They are under regulatory influence of sex steroid hormones, mainly estrogens. It is appeared that estrogen may act within central nervous system through the genomic and nongenomic effect. In this article the mechanisms of estrogen influence on the function and metabolism of neuronal cells have been presented. The neuroendocrine background of some menopausal symptoms also has been discussed. Particularly the etiopathogenesis of hot flushes and cognitive functions has been analyzed.

395,9666272,Cocaine enhances monocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. Cocaine's connection to AIDS dementia and vasculitis?,"Cocaine has wide-ranging effects on the immune and neuroendocrine systems (Fiala et al., 1996) resembling an inflammatory ""stress"" response with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulation of the HPA axis (Gan et al., 1997). Cocaine abuse has also been associated with vascular pathology, including vasculitis, vasospasm and hemorrhage. These effects suggest that cocaine could perturb the function of endothelial cells, including the blood-brain barrier, and influence the progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals (Shapshak et al., 1997; Goodkin et al., 1997). In order to understand clinical consequences of cocaine abuse, it is important to gain insight into molecular and cellular basis of cocaine's effects on immune and endothelial cells. Cocaine's in vitro effects on (a) permeability, (b) immune cell migration, (c) adhesion molecules, and (d) cytokine expression were investigated in a blood-brain barrier model constructed with brain microvascular endothelial cells and fetal astrocytes with the following results: (a) cocaine and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) increased the model's permeability to inulin similarly in a dose-responsive fashion; (b) cocaine (10(-4) to 10(-8_ M) enhanced monocyte migration across the barrier with the maximum increase, approximately 100%, by 10(-5) M cocaine; (c) cocaine treatment also increased the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecules-1 (VCAM-1) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1); (d) although the cocaine in vitro effects on cytokine production by mononuclear cells have been difficult to assess due to a heterogeneity in the degree of responsiveness between individuals, the data suggest that mononuclear cells from cocaine addicts are sensitized to in vitro cocaine challenge with hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines. Cocaine's in vivo manifestations are compatible with these in vitro effects: (A) chronic cocaine treatment of rats significantly increased rolling white blood cell flux, leukocyte-endothelium adhesion, and ICAM-1 expression in the mesentery (House et al., 1996); (B) cocaine injection to cocaine-dependent subjects tipped the balance of cytokine secretion by mononuclear cells to Th1-type (Gan et al., 1997), and (C) cocaine injection stimulated the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) to increase both anti- and pro-inflammatory hormonal secretion. Collectively, these results suggest that the immune effects of cocaine on endothelial, immune and neuroendocrine cells impair the function of the blood-brain, barrier, increase cell emigration from the blood vessels, in particular into the brain, and may cause vasculitis. These effects could also increase importation of HIV-1 into the brain.",[],Advances in experimental medicine and biology,1998-07-17,"[{'lastname': 'Fiala', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90095,USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gan', 'firstname': 'X H', 'initials': 'XH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'House', 'firstname': 'S D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Newton', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Graves', 'firstname': 'M C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shapshak', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stins', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'K S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Witte', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'S L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/978-1-4615-5347-2_22,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de9f8c20>

The pituitary gland has been established as a good predictor of environmental Hg exposure. Neutron activation analysis was utilized to determine levels of these elements in pituitary glands of 43 AD subjects and 15 control subjects. No significant differences were observed between the AD and control means for these five elements. The sole significant Pearson's correlation involving Hg was the established correlation with Se, indicative of the detoxification of Hg.

397,9629527,Cognitive and noncognitive symptoms in dementia patients: relationship to cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone.,"We investigated the relationship between basal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels and impairment in different cognitive and noncognitive measures and the possible interaction of DHEA with hypercortisolemia in dementia in 27 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There were 17 men and 10 women. Patients were mildly to moderately cognitively impaired at the time of the initial cortisol measures. Patients were administered the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at approximately 6-month intervals. Cortisol and DHEA were determined using conventional 125I radioimmunoassay procedures. Pearson product-moment correlations among cortisol and DHEA measures and both initial and longitudinal clinical measures were calculated. There was a relationship between baseline 8 a.m. cortisol levels and cognitive function at the initial testing as measured by the ADAS cognitive measure, with higher cortisol levels being associated with a greater level of impairment. We did not document a relationship between cortisol or DHEA levels and noncognitive measures. There was a significant correlation between both the initial MMSE and ADAS cognitive measures and initial DHEA level, with lower DHEA levels unexpectedly being associated with better performance on these measures. The initial DHEA levels did not predict decline in cognitive function over time.

399,9482539,Mood and cognitive side effects of interferon-alpha therapy.,"The central nervous system side effects associated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy, including depression and cognitive changes, can compromise otherwise effective immunotherapy. The term ""depression"" has multiple meanings ranging from a feeling of sadness to a neuropsychiatric disorder with defined diagnostic criteria. A syndrome of mood disturbance with memory impairment, cognitive slowing, and impaired executive function is common with IFN-alpha therapy and is consistent with mild subcortical dementia. Cognitive deficits and mood disorder may occur independently, and in some cases depression is a reactive phenomenon. Risk factors for development of IFN-alpha neurotoxicity include duration of treatment, high-dose therapy, and prior cranial irradiation or neurologic illness. Past or current psychiatric illness also may put the patient at risk. Subtypes of major depression are associated with neuroendocrine and neurochemical alterations that are consistent with the observed activities of IFN-alpha. This may provide insight into the etiology of IFN-alpha neurotoxicity, as well as possible interventions. Assessment of the neuropsychiatric status of patients treated with IFN-alpha should be a standard of care. Possible pharmacologic interventions to decrease the neurotoxicity associated with IFN-alpha therapy include antidepressants, psychostimulants, and opioid antagonists.

3500852",Physiological and pathological roles of interleukin-6 in the central nervous system.,"The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important mediator of inflammatory and immune responses in the periphery. IL-6 is produced in the periphery and acts systemically to induce growth and differentiation of cells in the immune and hematopoietic systems and to induce and coordinate the different elements of the acute-phase response. In addition to these peripheral actions, recent studies indicate that IL-6 is also produced within the central nervous system (CNS) and may play an important role in a variety of CNS functions such as cell-to-cell signaling, coordination of neuroimmune responses, protection of neurons from insult, as well as neuronal differentiation, growth and survival. IL-6 may also contribute to the etiology of neuropathological disorders. Elevated levels of IL-6 in the CNS are found in several neurological disorders including AIDS dementia complex, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, CNS trauma, and viral and bacterial meningitis. Moreover, several studies have shown that chronic overexpression of IL-6 in transgenic mice can lead to significant neuroanatomical and neurophysiological changes in the CNS similar to that commonly observed in various neurological diseases. Thus, it appears that IL-6 may play a role in both physiological and pathophysiological processes in the CNS.",[],Molecular neurobiology,1998-02-11,"[{'lastname': 'Gruol', 'firstname': 'D L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropharmacology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'T E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/BF02740665,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd54e4f0>

A previously unreported pattern of cytoskeletal changes was identified in the neurohypophysis consisting of axon-like fibers and large swellings resembling Herring bodies. The density of the cytoskeletal lesions was subject to notable variation among individuals. Marked neurohypophyseal alterations were also noted in cases even devoid of Alzheimer's disease-related cytoskeletal pathology in neocortical areas. Fully developed Alzheimer's disease is thus not a prerequisite for the presence of advanced neurohypophyseal alterations. In conclusion, the aged human neurohypophysis is revealed as a potential focus of abnormal cytoskeletal changes which may impair the neuroendocrine function of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system.",[],Neuroscience letters,1998-02-07,"[{'lastname': 'Schultz', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Morphology, J.

Limitations to the use of postmortem brain for examining molecular mechanisms underscore the need to develop a human tissue model representative of the pathophysiological processes that characterize AD. The use of peripheral tissues, particularly of cultured skin fibroblasts derived from AD patients, could complement studies of autopsy samples and provide a useful tool with which to investigate such dynamic processes as signal transduction systems, ionic homeostasis, oxidative metabolism, and APP processing. Peripheral cells as well as body fluids (i.e., plasma and CSF) could also provide peripheral biological markers for the diagnosis of AD. The criteria required for a definite diagnosis of AD presently include clinical criteria in association with histopathologic evidence obtained from biopsy or autopsy.

Three hormonal systems show decreasing circulating hormone concentrations during normal aging: (i) estrogen (in menopause) and testosterone (in andropause), (ii) dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulphate (in adrenopause), and (iii) the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I axis (in somatopause). Physical changes during aging have been considered physiologic, but there is evidence that some of these changes are related to this decline in hormonal activity. Hormone replacement strategies have been developed, but many of their aspects remain controversial, and increasing blood hormone levels in aging individuals to those found during mid-adult life has not been uniformly proven to be safe and of benefit.",[],"Science (New York, N.Y.)",1997-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Lamberts', 'firstname': 'S W', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands. lamberts@inw3.azr.nl'}, {'lastname': 'van den Beld', 'firstname': 'A W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'van der Lely', 'firstname': 'A J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1126/science.278.5337.419,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05deac36d0>
406,9352432,The accelerated aging hypothesis of Parkinson's disease is not supported by the pattern of circadian melatonin secretion.,"Hypotheses pertaining to the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested that the disease reflects an accelerated form of the normal aging process. Aging is associated with progressive failure of the pineal gland associated with a gradual decline in nighttime plasma melatonin secretion. The decline in melatonin secretion with age, at an average rate of 10-15% per decade, is considered a marker of brain aging in humans and estimations of plasma melatonin levels could be used to distinguish the processes of normal aging from pathological age-related changes. The accelerated aging hypothesis of PD is not supported by studies which have examined nocturnal melatonin secretion in drug naive Parkinsonian patients compared to age matched normal control subjects. Specifically, these studies have revealed no significant differences in the melatonin rhythms (i.e., peak nocturnal melatonin level and 24-hour melatonin output) between PD patients and normal age matched controls. On the other hand, melatonin secretion is significantly lower in Alzheimer's patients compared to age matched normal subjects. Collectively, it is suggested, on the basis of melatonin circadian rhythms, that Alzheimer's disease rather than PD is related to an accelerated aging process, a hypothesis which is supported by pathological and neurochemical studies.",[],The International journal of neuroscience,1997-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sandyk', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Touro College, Dix Hills, NY 11746, USA.'}]",,,,,10.3109/00207459709000643,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05deae2950>
407,9255217,"The not-so-good old days: working with pituitary growth hormone in North America, 1956 to 1985.","Before 1985 the use of growth hormone (GH) was governed by a philosophy of scarcity and conservation of resources. Between 1956 and 1959 human pituitary GH was shown to be effective. The competition for gland collection and extraction that followed benefited only certain patients with motivated parents and only a few investigators. To maximize gland collection, the distribution of GH for clinical investigation, and the number of patients who could be treated, the National Institutes of Health and the College of American Pathologists formed the National Pituitary Agency (NPA). In Canada a similar program was developed by the Canadian Medical Research Council. For more than 20 years the NPA supervised most of the GH treatment in the United States. Commercial pituitary GH entered the U.S. market in 1976, and competition soon appeared. Patients treated through the NPA were subjects in clinical studies for part of the first year of treatment, after which the limited availability of GH dictated treatment for only part of the year and caps on final heights. By 1984 treatment was year round and the height caps largely unenforced. In the last year of its distribution NPA GH was used in 2450 patients in the United States and commercial pituitary GH was used in 600 to 800; slightly more than 300 patients were being treated in Canada. And then, in 1985, came Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. While the not-so-good old days are gone and need not be lamented, there remains virtue in a conservative therapeutic philosophy.

The relationship between these physiologic measures and individual characteristics such as age, gender, medical status, severity of stress, severity of depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden was tested. In addition, the association between NK activity and alterations of the neuroendocrine measures was investigated. As compared to controls, the Alzheimer caregivers had similar levels of NK activity and of basal plasma neuroendocrine hormones and sympathetic measures. While older age and male gender status were associated with increased levels of ACTH, neither medical caseness, severity of life stress, nor severity of depressive symptoms was associated with alterations in any of the multiple physiologic domains. Classification of Alzheimer caregiver burden identified caregivers who were mismatched in terms of the amount of care they were required to provide and the amount of respite time received. The mismatched caregivers had significantly higher basal plasma ACTH but no change in other physiological measures, as compared to non-mismatched caregivers. NK activity was negatively correlated with plasma levels of neuropeptide Y but not with any of the other neuroendocrine measures.

414,8780856,Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis responses to physostigmine: effects of Alzheimer's disease and gender.,"We asked whether hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis responses to a cholinergic stimulus are blunted in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) of mild to moderate severity. Such a finding would be consistent with a central cholinergic deficiency early in the course of AD. To address this question, we measured the plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta E-LI), and cortisol responses to the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine in 10 healthy normal older subjects (age = 71 +/- 2 years) and 11 outpatients with probable AD (age = 72 +/- 2 years; Mini Mental State Exam score = 19 +/- 2). Cortisol concentrations were higher in AD subjects throughout the study, but AD and normal older subjects had similar robust ACTH, beta E-LI, and cortisol responses to physostigmine. In all subjects combined, women had greater ACTH, beta E-LI, and cortisol responses to physostigmine than did men. Plasma physostigmine concentrations did not differ between groups. These results suggest that female gender enhances the magnitude of HPA axis responses to cholinergic stimulation in older humans; however, the HPA axis response to physostigmine does not appear to reflect central cholinergic deficiency in the early stages of AD.",[],Biological psychiatry,1996-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Peskind', 'firstname': 'E R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Seattle WA 98108, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Raskind', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wingerson', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pascualy', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Thal', 'firstname': 'L J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dobie', 'firstname': 'D J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wilkinson', 'firstname': 'C W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0006-3223(95)00318-5,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dde997c0>

There is increasing interest that raised corticosteroid levels, due to activation of the HPA axis, may cause both depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments. Steroid effects on cognition may be via the hippocampus, a major site of corticosteroid action and an important structure involved in learning and memory.
To investigate this further, we examined the relationship between the dexamethasone suppression test, cognitive function, depressive symptoms and hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 32 normal controls, 49 subjects with NINCDS/ADRDA Alzheimer's disease and 51 patients with DSM-III-R Major Depression.
Controlling for differences in dexamethasone concentrations, post-dexamethasone cortisol levels were related to advancing age in controls and depressed subjects.

Neuroendocrine findings include: central depletion of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine, adrenaline (AD), and serotonin (5-HT); reduction in the ratio of circulating NA/AD as well as platelet 5-HT and increase of AD, plasma free 5-HT and cortisol. These disturbances together with the increased platelet aggregability observed in the three groups are typical of unresolved-stress situations. Immunological findings include significant reduction of peripheral T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) and the CD4/CD8 ratio, CD16 and gamma-delta cells. On the other hand, the three groups (elderly subjects, subjects faced with unresolved stress, and BZ consumers) show increase of the CD57 lymphocyte subset as well as natural killer cytotoxicity. Alterations of several biological markers have also been found, specifically in the oral glucose tolerance test, the intramuscular clonidine test, and the supine/orthostasis/exercise test. From a clinical point of view, the three groups appear to be more susceptible to the appearance and progression of many acute and chronic diseases (infectious and malignant diseases). As a result, chronic consumption of BZs should be avoided in both the elderly and subjects in unresolved-stress situations.",[],Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,1996-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Lechin', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Section of Psychopharmacology, Central University of Venezuela, Caracas.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Dijs', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Benaim', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1159/000289072,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd341220>
421,8643765,Enhanced adrenal sensitivity to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is evidence of HPA axis hyperactivity in Alzheimer's disease.,"Adrenal sensitivity was assessed in 16 non-depressed patients with NINCDS/ADRDA Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 18 control subjects by measuring cortisol response to low dose (0.05 microgram/kg i.v.) exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Controlling for sex and medication, both peak cortisol level (peak-baseline) and area under cortisol response curve (AUC above baseline) were significantly greater in AD subjects. This shows that HPA axis hyperactivity, as demonstrated by enhanced adrenal sensitivity to ACTH, occurs in AD. Similar findings have been reported to occur in depression. Among AD subjects, AUC cortisol response correlated with current age (r = 0.70, P = 0.001) and age at onset of dementia (r = 0.73, P = 0.001) and an inverse correlation was seen between cortisol AUC and cognitive test (CAMCOG) score (r = -0.51, P = 0.044). Our findings suggest that HPA axis hyperactivity in AD is associated with advancing age and cognitive dysfunction.

422,8746750,Reversal of alexia in multiple sclerosis by weak electromagnetic fields.,"The occurrence of cognitive deficits in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been recognized since 1877 when Charcot first observed ""enfeeblement of memory"" in his patients. Cognitive deficits have been reported in almost 50% of patients with a relapsing-remitting course and in a significantly higher percentage of patients with a chronic progressive course leading to intellectual disability which is often severe enough to preclude employment. MS is considered a form of subcortical dementia and the occurrence of classical cortical disorders such as aphasia, agnosia and apraxia is reported to be rare in the disease. However, in my experience alexia, a reading impairment unrelated to visual acuity or visual field defects, is common in patients with MS. Recently, I reported that treatment with picotesla range electromagnetic fields (EMFs) is an efficacious modality in the management of both the motor and cognitive symptoms of MS. Three patients with MS who developed alexia as a manifestation of the disease are presented. In all patients the alexia was reversed several months after they began treatment with EMFs. Since alexia usually reflects a disconnection syndrome whereby lesions involving the left visual cortex and the splenium of the corpus callosum disconnect language association areas from visual association areas, it is suggested that reversal of the alexia in these patients by EMFs was related to improved interhemispheric transcallosal transmission of visual information. In addition, it is conceivable that changes in the metabolism of monoamines, which are involved in visual information processing and reading comprehension, may have been important in causing reversal of the alexia. This report further supports the unique efficacy of this treatment modality in reversing specific cognitive deficits in MS.",[],The International journal of neuroscience,1995-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sandyk', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'NeuroCommunication Research Laboratories, Danbury, CT 06811, USA.'}]",,,,,10.3109/00207459508986326,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd3305e0>
423,8709678,CDP-choline: pharmacological and clinical review.,"Cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine, CDP-choline or citicoline, is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of the structural phospholipids of cell membranes, especially in that of phosphatidylcholine. Upon oral or parenteral administration, CDP-choline releases its two principle components, cytidine and choline. When administered orally, it is absorbed almost completely, and its bioavailability is approximately the same as when administered intravenously. Once absorbed, the cytidine and choline disperse widely throughout the organism, cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the central nervous system (CNS), where they are incorporated into the phospholipid fraction of the membrane and microsomes. CDP-choline activates the biosynthesis of structural phospholipids in the neuronal membranes, increases cerebral metabolism and acts on the levels of various neurotransmitters. Thus, it has been experimentally proven that CDP-choline increases noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the CNS. Due to these pharmacological activities, CDP-choline has a neuroprotective effect in situations of hypoxia and ischemia, as well as improved learning and memory performance in animal models of brain aging. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CDP-choline restores the activity of mitochondrial ATPase and of membranal Na+/K+ ATPase, inhibits the activation of phospholipase A2 and accelerates the reabsorption of cerebral edema in various experimental models. CDP-choline is a safe drug, as toxicological tests have shown; it has no serious effects on the cholinergic system and it is perfectly tolerated. These pharmacological characteristics, combined with CDP-choline's mechanisms of action, suggest that this drug may be suitable for the treatment of cerebral vascular disease, head trauma of varying severity and cognitive disorders of diverse etiology. In studies carried out on the treatment of patients with head trauma, CDP-choline accelerated the recovery from post-traumatic coma and the recuperation of walking ability, achieved a better final functional result and reduced the hospital stay of these patients, in addition to improving the cognitive and memory disturbances which are observed after a head trauma of lesser severity and which constitute the disorder known as postconcussion syndrome. In the treatment of patients with acute cerebral vascular disease of the ischemic type, CDP-choline accelerated the recovery of consciousness and motor deficit, attaining a better final result and facilitating the rehabilitation of these patients. The other important use for CDP-choline is in the treatment of senile cognitive impairment, which is secondary to degenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and to chronic cerebral vascular disease. In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, CDP-choline improves scores on cognitive evaluation scales, while in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type, it slows the disease's evolution. Beneficial neuroendocrine, neuroimmunomodulatory and neurophysiological effects have been described. CDP-choline has also been shown to be effective as co-therapy for Parkinson's disease. No serious side effects have been found in any of the groups of patients treated with CDP-choline, which demonstrates the safety of the treatment.",[],Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,1995-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Secades', 'firstname': 'J J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'F.I.S.A.

424,7558655,Weak electromagnetic fields improve body image perception in patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Neuropsychological studies have demonstrated that multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with various cognitive deficits and it has been suggested that it be considered a form of subcortical dementia. It is now recognized that visuoperceptive and visuomotor deficits commonly occur in MS patients particularly in those with chronic progressive course of the disease. The Human Figure Drawing Test has been employed in the assessment of generalized intellectual deterioration and specifically in the evaluation of visuoperceptive, visuospatial and visuoconstructional abilities in brain injured patients. I have demonstrated recently, on the basis of various drawing test, the external application of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla (pT) range intensity improved visuoperceptive and visuospatial functions in patients with MS. In the present communication I present five MS patients who were administered the Human Figure Drawing Test before and after a series of treatments with EMFs. Prior to application of EMFs four of these patients' drawings showed distortions, poor perspectives, impoverished facial expression, and lack of attention to details suggesting poor body image perception related to right posterior hemispheric dysfunction. In response to the administration of EMFs the group demonstrated improvement in motor disability which was associated with a striking improvement in the drawing particularly the drawings of the face the perception of which is localized to the right parietal lobe. These findings demonstrate that treatment with pT EMFs improves body image perception in MS patients thus corroborating previous observations which demonstrated this treatment modality to exert beneficial effects on cognitive functions in patients with MS.",[],The International journal of neuroscience,1995-06-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sandyk', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'NeuroCommunication Research Laboratories, Danbury, CT 06811, USA.'}]",,,,,10.3109/00207459508999807,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd352400>
425,7556505,Individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in later life and hippocampal aging.,"Variation in magnitude of cognitive decline in later life is a central feature of human aging. The more severe forms of dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease, clearly define one end of the spectrum. However, among those showing no obvious signs of clinical dementia there are considerable individual differences. Thus, although evidence for learning, memory, and language loss appears in some individuals as early as 50-55 years of age, many people continue to function alertly well into their 90s. These individuals exemplify what Rowe and Kahn (1987) have termed ""successful"" aging. The wide variability in CNS aging, often a nuisance factor in studies, are becoming a major focus for brain aging research (e.g., Gage et al., 1984;Gallager and Pelleymounter, 1988; Aitken and Meaney, 1990; Issa et al., 1990). Our studies over the past few years have added support to the idea that individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity can account for part of the variation seen in neurological function among the elderly. In this article we discuss the evidence for the idea that adrenal glucocorticoids can compromise hippocampal function and, thus, produce cognitive impairments, as well as the potential mechanisms for these effects.",[],Experimental gerontology,1995-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Meaney', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Developmental Neuroendocrinology Laboratory, Douglas Hospital Research Center, Montréal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Donnell"", 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rowe', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tannenbaum', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Steverman', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nair', 'firstname': 'N P', 'initials': 'NP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lupien', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0531-5565(94)00065-b,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05debd68b0>

427,7777138,Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system function in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"The neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are very prominent in the hippocampus, a brain site which is pivotal for the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Thus, the combined dexamethasone-suppression/CRH-stimulation-test outcome in patients with AD was compared to that of healthy elderly controls to assess--with a more refined neuroendocrine challenge procedure--HPA function in AD. Cortisol secretion after dexamethasone (DEX) pretreatment and before CRH was increased in Alzheimer's patients and 21% of this group were DST-nonsuppressors. None of the healthy control subjects escaped DEX-induced suppression of cortisol. However, after additional CRH administration, AD patients released significantly less cortisol and ACTH than the control subjects. No correlations were found between any of the endocrine parameters and degree of severity of dementia. It is concluded that the DST part of the DEX/CRH test better reflects glucocorticoid feedback disturbances, probably at a suprapituitary level. The CRH part of the DEX/CRH-test outcome might indicate the loss of endogenous CRH-Arginine-Vasopressin (AVP) synergism of the HPA system of these patients.",[],Neurobiology of aging,1995-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hatzinger', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Basle, Department of Psychiatry, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': ""Z'Brun"", 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hemmeter', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Seifritz', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Baumann', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Holsboer-Trachsler', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Heuser', 'firstname': 'I J', 'initials': 'IJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0197-4580(94)00159-6,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05debbbbd0>
428,7775073,Improvement in short-term visual memory by weak electromagnetic fields in Parkinson's disease.,Neuropsychological studies have demonstrated that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with various cognitive deficits ultimately leading in about 30% of patients to the development of dementia. These studies have demonstrated also a greater decrement of right hemispheric functions with visuospatial deficits occurring in up to 90% of PD patients. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) Test has been employed in the assessment of right hemispheric functions and particularly for the evaluation of visuoconstructive abilities and short-term visual memory. I have demonstrated recently that external application of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla (pT) range intensity is an effective nonpharmacological modality in the management of the motor and cognitive deficits of Parkinsonism. In the present communication I present 3 fully medicated nondemented PD patients (mean age: 68 +/- 8.1 yrs; mean duration of illness: 9.0 +/- 4.0 yrs; mean disability on the Hoehn and Yahr scale: 3) who were tested on the ROCF Test before and after a series of treatments with EMFs. In response to the administration of EMFs the group demonstrated a mean of 23.1 +/- 13.6% improved performance on copy of the ROCF and a 39.3 +/- 13.4% improvement of short-term recall of the ROCF.

429,8584603,Neuroendocrine responses to intravenous infusion of arecoline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"We have reported that arecoline, a muscarinic receptor agonist replicably enhanced verbal memory in five of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the mechanism of cognitive improvement, circulating hormone measurements were made during high-dose acute and low-dose chronic intravenous (i.v.) arecoline administration to AD patients. Acute hormone responses were measured during, and for 6 h after, infusion of arecoline 5 mg i.v. over 30 min. Chronic responses were measured in cognitive responders during continuous i.v. infusion of arecoline escalating over 2 weeks (0.5-40 mg/day) and then during a 1 week infusion of the dose optimizing cognition (4-16 mg/day). Acute arecoline administered to 14 subjects produced unpleasant side-effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting), mean adrenocorticotrophic hormone (p = .0006), cortisol (p = .0001) and beta-endorphin (p = .0001) levels were elevated. During chronic arecoline treatment, no side-effects occurred and plasma cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone and beta-endorphin levels were unchanged in nine subjects overall and in five cognitive responders. Thus, high-dose arecoline activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and may increase other anterior pituitary hormone levels, likely representing a 'stress response', but cognition-enhancing, low doses of arecoline do not produce a glucocorticoid response. Hence, arecoline-induced memory improvement is not due to the induction of 'stress' nor to the elevation of peripheral corticosteroid levels.",[],Psychoneuroendocrinology,1995-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Asthana', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Unit on Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Raffaele', 'firstname': 'K C', 'initials': 'KC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Greig', 'firstname': 'N H', 'initials': 'NH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Berardi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morris', 'firstname': 'P P', 'initials': 'PP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schapiro', 'firstname': 'M B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rapoport', 'firstname': 'S I', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Blackman', 'firstname': 'M R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Soncrant', 'firstname': 'T T', 'initials': 'TT', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0306-4530(94)00084-n,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05debda040>

The patients were rated according to the DSM-III-R criteria as having mild, moderate or severe dementia and were also assessed using the GBS scale which gives a profile of the dementia syndrome. In the total group of dementia there were significant correlations between severity of dementia and post-DST levels. The frequency of pathological DST also correlated significantly with the severity of dementia. In the subgroups of dementia a strong correlation between severity of dementia and high post-DST cortisol levels was found only in the VAD group. Between the subgroups of dementia disorders there were no significant differences in basal cortisol levels. The percentage of pathological DST was lowest in the AD group (40%). It was somewhat higher in the VAD group (49%), still higher in the SDAT group (54%) and highest in the NUD group (59%). When the relationship between post-DST cortisol levels and GBS scores was analyzed, significant correlations were found mainly in the VAD group. There intellectual impairment, anxiety, fear-panic and restlessness correlated significantly with post-DST cortisol levels. The results indicate hypothalamic overactivity in a substantial number of demented patients. In VAD and to a certain extent also in SDAT a disconnection between cortical areas, including the hippocampus, and the hypothalamus is assumed.

437,7960477,Alzheimer's disease: improvement of visual memory and visuoconstructive performance by treatment with picotesla range magnetic fields.,"Impairments in visual memory and visuoconstructive functions commonly occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, I reported that external application of electromagnetic fields (EMF) of extremely low intensity (in the picotesla range) and of low frequency (in the range of 5Hz-8Hz) improved visual memory and visuoperceptive functions in patients with Parkinson's disease. Since a subgroup of Parkinsonian patients, specifically those with dementia, have coexisting pathological and clinical features of AD, I investigated in two AD patients the effects of these extremely weak EMF on visual memory and visuoconstructive performance. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test as well as sequential drawings from memory of a house, a bicycle, and a man were employed to evaluate the effects of EMF on visual memory and visuoconstructive functions, respectively. In both patients treatment with EMF resulted in a dramatic improvement in visual memory and enhancement of visuoconstructive performance which was associated clinically with improvement in other cognitive functions such as short term memory, calculations, spatial orientation, judgement and reasoning as well as level of energy, social interactions, and mood. The report demonstrates, for the first time, that specific cognitive symptoms of AD are improved by treatment with EMF of a specific intensity and frequency. The rapid improvement in cognitive functions in response to EMF suggests that some of the mental deficits of AD are reversible being caused by a functional (i.e., synaptic transmission) rather than a structural (i.e., neuritic plaques) disruption of neuronal communication in the central nervous system.",[],The International journal of neuroscience,1994-06-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sandyk', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'NeuroCommunication Research Laboratories, Danbury, CT 06811.'}]",,,,,10.3109/00207459408986003,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd8105e0>

The mean latency to onset of the first neurological symptoms was 22 months (range 6-40 months), and mean duration of follow-up was 86 months (range 60-126). Three patients died at a mean of 84 months after radiotherapy (range 62-98). A fourth patient probably died from metastatic disease. Three patients remain alive, albeit severely disabled, after 5-10 years. The illness typically ran a stepwise course, with fits and stroke-like episodes occurring against a background of progressive dementia and somnolence. CT and MRI scans showed progressive ventricular dilatation associated with cerebral atrophy and diffuse or focal changes in the white matter. Four patients had had two or more neurosurgical procedures after the radiotherapy. In only one of the seven patients was the diagnosis made at presentation.

Recent studies employing standardized neuropsychological tests have confirmed the high incidence of cognitive deficits in MS patients particularly those with a chronic progressive course of the disease. Visuoperceptive and visuomotor deficits commonly occur in MS patients and are thought to reflect damage to attentional systems due to interruption by demyelinating plaques of nerve conduction along the ascending projections from the brainstem reticular formation to the cortex. Impairment of synaptic conductivity due to serotoninergic depletion (5-HT) may contribute to the emergence of cognitive deficits in MS. The present communication concerns a 36 year old patient with MS in whom external application of picoTesla range magnetic fields (MF) resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms including visuoperceptive functions as demonstrated on various drawing tasks.

440,7924632,Chrono-neuroendocrinological aspects of physiological aging and senile dementia.,"The circadian pattern of melatonin and cortisol secretion was evaluated in two groups of elderly subjects (aged 66-90 years), one with Alzheimer's type of multiinfarct dementia (n = 27) and the other without cognitive impairment (n = 16); 13 clinically healthy women aged 20 to 30 years were chosen as controls. All demented patients had severe mental impairment, corresponding to stage 6 of the Global Deterioration Scale. All subjects, either young or aged, were studied as in-patients and were well synchronized with respect to meal timing, diurnal activity and nocturnal rest. At the population mean cosinor analysis (Halberg, 1969) both melatonin and cortisol circadian rhythms reached statistical significance in the three groups of subjects. However, the melatonin circadian profile was clearly flattened in the two groups of elderly subjects by comparison with young controls, due to the selective impairment of melatonin nocturnal secretion. In both elderly groups, but particularly in demented patients, plasma cortisol levels were significantly higher by comparison to young controls, particularly at evening and night time. A significant direct relationship linked the subjects' age and the nadir values of plasma cortisol. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis to dexamethasone (DXM) suppression test (1 mg orally at 2300) was significantly reduced in both elderly groups, and especially in old demented patients, by comparison with young controls. Finally, plasma cortisol response to pulse i.v. injection of a small dose of synthetic corticotropin (Synacthen 2,500 ng) was significantly higher and more prolonged in old demented patients than in mentally healthy old subjects and in young controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",[],Chronobiologia,1994-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Dori', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Terapia Medica, Università di Pavia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Casale', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Solerte', 'firstname': 'S B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fioravanti', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Migliorati', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cuzzoni', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddabf860>

The present study used a monoclonal antibody against EGFR to examine its expression in pituitary gland, scalp, abdominal skin and brain of 29 patients with and without various dementias and neurological deficits, as well as normal aged controls. Of 20 clinically demented patients examined postmortem, 15 exhibited EGFR immunoreactivity (IR) on brain and peripheral vascular endothelial cells. Examination of nine non-demented patients revealed only 1 patient with EGFR-IR. EGFR-IR was expressed on all blood vessels, regardless of size or location within the tissue examined. Ultrastructural analysis of EGFR revealed that in pituitary, like brain, the receptor was restricted to the lumenal cell surface of vascular endothelial cells. In all cases of EGFR-IR there was an absolute correlation between central nervous system and peripheral expression; if there was EGFR-IR in brain vessels it was present in skin. If there was no staining in brain there was no peripheral skin vessel staining; and vice versa.

Visuoperceptive deficits can result from cortical and subcortical lesions involving the right hemisphere, thalamus, and basal ganglia and are thought to reflect a defect in attentional-arousal mechanisms induced by lesions that interrupt a cortical-limbic-reticular activating loop.

447,1292449,Side-effects: mercury contribution to body burden from dental amalgam.,"The purpose of this paper is to examine and report on studies that relate mercury levels in human tissues to the presence of dental amalgams, giving special attention to autopsy studies. Until recently, there have been few published studies examining the relationship between dental amalgams and tissue mercury levels. Improved and highly sensitive tissue analysis techniques have made it possible to measure elements in the concentration range of parts per billion. The fact that mercury can be absorbed and reach toxic levels in human tissues makes any and all exposure to that element of scientific interest. Dental amalgams have long been believed to be of little significance as contributors to the overall body burden of mercury, because the elemental form of mercury is rapidly consumed in the setting reaction of the restoration. Studies showing measurable elemental mercury vapor release from dental amalgams have raised renewed concern about amalgam safety. Mercury vapor absorption occurs through the lungs, with about 80% of the inhaled vapor being absorbed by the lungs and rapidly entering the bloodstream. Following distribution by blood circulation, mercury can enter and remain in certain tissues for longer periods of time, since the half-life of excretion is prolonged. Two of the primary target organs of concern are the central nervous system and kidneys.",[],Advances in dental research,1992-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Reinhardt', 'firstname': 'J W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Operative Dentistry, University of Iowa College of Dentistry, Iowa City 52242.'}]",,,,,10.1177/08959374920060010201,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddadcef0>
448,1359604,Effects of hypothalamic peptides on the aging brain.,"The hypothalamic peptide hormones, TRH, LHRH (GnRH), CRH, GHRH, and GHIRH (somatostatin), influence the release of the anterior pituitary hormones, which in turn promote the release of target endocrine gland hormones and other metabolites. These latter compounds feed back to the brain to help control the secretion of the hypothalamic hormones. This is a dynamic interaction that is influenced by the aging process: Most of these hormones systems become less responsive with advancing age, due to decreased function of peptide-containing secretory neurons, a loss of hormone receptor sensitivity, and/or a reduction in the output of the target endocrine glands. That the hypothalamic peptides themselves can influence brain function is supported by the fact that most are found in areas of the brain other than the hypothalamus and that receptors for them exist in these other areas. For example, CRH is contained in a number of central neural systems that can influence behavior, including limbic areas, the hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, median raphé nuclei, and cortical interneurons. CRH has been shown to be anxiogenic in animal models, and its effect can be blocked by CRH receptor antagonists. CRH content in the locus coeruleus is particularly increased by stress and may influence norepinephrine neurotransmitter function in this structure. In aging there is a gradual reduction of the sensitivity of the brain to the negative feedback of corticosteroids, such that CRH secretion becomes somewhat increased under basal conditions. The behavioral effects of this change are unclear, however, as is the influence of stress-related activation of CRH, ACTH, and glucocorticoid secretion on behavior in the elderly. Other hypothalamic peptides have different patterns of change with aging, and some are markedly altered in pathological conditions; for example, in Alzheimer's disease the content of CRH and somatostatin in certain brain areas is decreased. However, whether the changes in hypothalamic peptides precede or follow the pathological behavioral changes, and how they participate in the changes, is still unclear.",[],Psychoneuroendocrinology,1992-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sadow', 'firstname': 'T F', 'initials': 'TF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Harbor-U.C.L.A.

449,1332100,The brain as a target for adrenocortical steroids: cognitive implications.,"It is well established that a reciprocal control exists between the brain and glucocorticoid hormones. The brain regulates adrenocortical function via hypothalamic corticotrophin releasing hormone-41 (CRH-41), glucocorticoids act at specific receptors in the hippocampus, thus promoting negative feedback mechanisms. Because the hippocampus is a major site for memory processes, a role for excessive/long-lasting plasma glucocorticoid levels has been suggested in conditions of mental impairment. Major depression, Cushing's disease, and dementia of the Alzheimer type are disorders which share hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as symptoms of cognitive decline. Although the mechanisms leading to hypercortisolemia appear to be different in each case, the neuropsychological features of these three disorders accord with the hypothesis of glucocorticoid-associated brain damage. It therefore is important to find pharmacological strategies that will avert or reduce these potential consequences on brain function.",[],Psychoneuroendocrinology,1992-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Martignoni', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology III, Institute C.

The secretory profile did not differentiate between patients and controls. Both secreted the largest amount of GH during the early nighthours between 22.00-02.00, whereas the majority of daytime GH levels were below the assay's detection limit (0.4 ng/ml). No difference was found in GH response to GHRH between patients and controls. All subjects showed significantly enhanced GH secretion after GHRH. Dividing the patients into two groups according to age-of-onset (less than 60 years greater than), there was a trend toward larger GH responses to GHRH for the early-onset group. No other parameter differentiated the groups. GH levels after clonidine were blunted in all subjects but one AD patient, probably due to an age-dependent attenuation frequently observed in subjects over 45 years of age. Finally, the administration of the somatostatin-analogue did not render conclusive results, since spontaneous decline of GH concentration was already beginning 2 hours before the drug was given and continued steadily throughout the observation period.

453,1480754,Anatomy of the human hypothalamus (chiasmatic and tuberal region).,"The hypothalamus sensu stricto consists of the chiasmatic, the tuberal and the mamillary region. The present study is confined to the poorly myelinated chiasmatic and tuberal region. Both regions harbor many nuclear grays with relatively clear-cut boundaries embedded in an ill-defined nerve cell assembly referred to as the hypothalamic gray. Prominent components of the chiasmatic region are the magnocellular neurosecretory complex (supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, accessory neurosecretory nucleus), the sexually dimorphic intermediate nucleus, the suprachiasmatic and retrochiasmatic nuclei. The dominating structure of the tuberal region is the complex of the ventromedial, posteromedial and dorsomedial nuclei supplemented by the periventricular and infundibular nuclei. Lateral portions of the tuber cinereum harbor the lateral tuberal nucleus and the tuberomamillary nucleus. The lateral tuberal nucleus exhibits pronounced cell loss in Huntington's chorea and is also severely involved in cases of dementia with argyrophilic grains. The large nerve cells of the tuberomamillary nucleus show particularly severe affection in both Alzheimer's (intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes) and Parkinson's disease (Lewy bodies).",[],Progress in brain research,1992-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Braak', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, J.W.

Increases in the activity of these cells, which are probably related to maturation of the system were observed during fetal development and probably extend well beyond term. During senescence an increase in the activity of the vasopressin cells in the human HNS was observed which is probably a compensation for age-related changes in kidney function. These data do not support a role of declining vasopressin secretion in age-related memory decline. Although there is some evidence for an impairment of vasopressin synthesis and release in Alzheimer patients, vasopressin cell numbers in Alzheimer's disease do not fall below values observed in young controls.

Basal cortisol and ACTH levels were significantly higher in patients with HD compared with controls. Following CRH administration, ACTH responses tended to be blunted in concert with normal cortisol levels. Two patients with HD and one control subject were DST nonsuppressors. Post-DST plasma dexamethasone levels were 57% lower among patients compared with the control group. Only in the HD group age was there an important variable in influencing spontaneous cortisol secretion as well as plasma dexamethasone levels during DST.

In the present study the reactivity of the hypophyseal-adrenocortical axis (HPA) in the elderly was assessed by hormonal stimulation of the hypophysis. Twelve young men (aged 21-24 yr), 15 mentally healthy elderly (aged 65-90 yr), and 12 patients with SDAT (aged 60-84 yr) received an iv bolus injection containing 50 micrograms CRH and 0.5 IU lysine vasopressin after a baseline period of 2 h. ACTH, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone secretion was monitored over a period of 2 h before and after the injection. The baseline ACTH concentrations were increased in both groups of elderly, the baseline cortisol levels were not different in either group. The peak ACTH and cortisol levels were significantly elevated in the mentally healthy elderly, whereas senile demented patients showed a rise comparable with that in the young subjects. Moreover, in the demented patients the post-stimulus decline in plasma ACTH levels seemed to be delayed. Dehydroepiandrosterone was significantly lowered in subjects of all ages. Our results demonstrate an enhanced reactivity of the HPA in mentally healthy elderly. This is possibly due to a diminished sensitivity of the feedback regulation to glucocorticoids. However, SDAT patients had, compared to healthy elderly subjects, an attenuated response to CRH/lysine vasopressin and a prolonged ACTH secretion, indicating alterations of the HPA in this disease.",[],The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,1991-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Dodt', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Abteilung Innere Medizin I, Universität Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dittmann', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hruby', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Späth-Schwalbe', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Born', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schüttler', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fehm', 'firstname': 'H L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1210/jcem-72-2-272,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd99ef90>

We describe a method using ultrafiltration and 6 M urea that reduced infectivity in human pituitary tissue that had been deliberately contaminated with scrapie virus (an animal analogue of human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease virus) from an initial level of 10(9.7) infectious units to just 5 infectious units. Based on estimates of the frequency of contamination and infectivity levels in batches of human pituitaries, the use of this protocol to prepare GH from cadaveric human glands yields a calculated probability of exposure to a contaminated vial of not greater than 1 in 3.2 million recipients; therefore, native hormone prepared by this method may be considered to be essentially risk-free. The same methodology may be useful in the preparation of other hormones, such as prolactin, for which no synthetic substitutes are currently available, as well as biological products derived from sheep or cattle, that may be infected with scrapie or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.",[],Hormone research,1991-01-11,"[{'lastname': 'Pocchiari', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Lecce, Italia.'}, {'lastname': 'Peano', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Conz', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Eshkol', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maillard', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gibbs', 'firstname': 'C J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Xi', 'firstname': 'Y G', 'initials': 'YG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tenham-Fisher', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Macchi', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1159/000181894,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd992f90>

4065091",Ultrastructural localization of the putative precursors of the A4 amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease.,"Any explanation of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and of its unique cerebral pathologic features must take into account the distribution and ultrastructural localization of the pre-A4 amyloid proteins in tissues and organs. The authors have analyzed the expression of the pre-A4 amyloid proteins in several tissues by immunogold electron microscopy and by immunofluorescence. For this purpose, they have used a mouse monoclonal antibody and a guinea pig antiserum raised against two synthetic peptides corresponding to two different sequences common to all the full-length forms of the A4 amyloid precursors. They observed a tissue-specific distribution of the secreted and the transmembrane form of the precursors. The authors could determine that the secreted form is generated in vivo within the cytoplasm. In the salivary glands and in the adenohypophysis, all the immunoreactivity is associated with the process of secretion, whereas in the muscle, a staining pattern compatible with the presence of the pre-A4 amyloid proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been observed. This difference in the localization may reflect tissue-specific processing pathways and suggests that posttranslational modifications such as proteolytic removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains contribute to the structural and thus functional diversity of the A4 amyloid precursors.",[],The American journal of pathology,1990-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Catteruccia', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Center for Molecular Biology, University of Heidelberg (ZMBH), FRG.'}, {'lastname': 'Willingale-Theune', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bunke', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Prior', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Masters', 'firstname': 'C L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Crisanti', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beyreuther', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de55a090>

416908",Food systems: the relationship between health and food science/technology.,"Changes in our understanding of diet and health drive changes in the way foods are processed. Conversely, what is available on the shelf will have an impact on the choices consumers make, thereby affecting their health. Historical examples of industrial manipulation of the diet include fortification and enrichment of cereal grains with vitamins; increased production of unsaturated vegetable oils and margarine as substitutions for hydrogenated fat, lard, and butter; lowered cholesterol content foods; reduced sugar content foods; lower sodium foods; decreased portion sizes or caloric density in prepackaged foods for use in weight loss or maintenance; and increased calcium levels to prevent osteoporosis. However, degenerative diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, bone disease, arthritis, and dementia will continue to be prevalent in the future. Whether or not the food systems available on the shelf can influence all of these disease states is not clear; however, studies have indicated that nutritional factors do contribute to the development of some of these diseases. Patterns in food consumption have changed and will continue to change as recommendations such as decreased consumption of saturated fats, salt, and cholesterol continue to be made. Increased ingestion of fish and/or fish oil is one recommendation that has been suggested because of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on platelet aggregability and circulating levels of lipids.

474,2095858,Neuroendocrine markers in aging brain: clinical and neurobiological significance of dexamethasone suppression test.,"The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is commonly accepted as an indicator of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning in clinical practice. In this study, DST was carried out in a geriatric population composed of patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), stroke and age-matched controls. The stress state of the subjects was also functionally assessed by the Symptoms Rating Test (SRT). The results disclosed no significant differences in basal cortisol levels in the three groups. A positive correlation between age and log-transformed basal cortisol levels was found in the entire population as well as in each group. After dexamethasone administration, 20% of controls, 49% of DAT patients, and 48% of stroke patients were non-suppressors. At 8.00 a.m. and 11.00 p.m. after dexamethasone, cortisol levels were significantly lower (p less than 0.02) in controls than in pathological groups. A significant positive correlation between age and symptoms of depression and anxiety was found. One-third of stroke patients showing lesions in the right hemisphere were non-suppressors, and presented mostly subcortical infarcts, while 1/4 of them had depressive disorders. This study demonstrated a progressive increase in basal cortisol levels and depressive symptoms with age, a poor diagnostic value of DST in age-related pathological conditions such as DAT and stroke, and the role of these cerebral pathologies in amplifying the neuroendocrine dysregulation due to the ageing process itself. DST is a useful biological marker for disclosing the vulnerability of the ageing brain, but it has no diagnostic value.",[],"Aging (Milan, Italy)",1990-06-01,"[{'lastname': 'Parnetti', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Chair of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Perugia University, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mecocci', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Neri', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Palazzetti', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fiacconi', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Santucci', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Santucci', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ballatori', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Reboldi', 'firstname': 'G P', 'initials': 'GP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Caputo', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/BF03323914,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de54c1d0>

CSF CRF levels in DAT were significantly higher than in controls and inversely related to the Mini Mental State (MMS) score. The patients also displayed increased morning (0800 h) plasma cortisol values, with higher mesor and amplitude in the circadian pattern. Dexamethasone resistance was shown by 6 of the 10 DAT subjects. Plasma cortisol response to CRF administration was similar in the two groups, except for the peak values, which in DAT patients were reached earlier than in controls.

476,2157505,"Cortisol, ACTH, and beta-endorphin after dexamethasone administration in Parkinson's dementia.","The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) has been suggested as an effective tool for differentiating between depression and dementia. After administering 1 mg dexamethasone, we measured cortisol, ACTH, and beta-endorphin levels in 32 nondepressed patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) (14 also with dementia) and 20 healthy, age-matched controls. Four of the 20 controls, 9 of the 18 with PD alone, and 8 of the 14 with PD and dementia were dexamethasone nonsuppressors (cortisol value greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/100 ml). PD patients without dementia (nonsuppressors) showed higher basal plasma values of cortisol (22.06 +/- 5.30 micrograms/100 ml) compared with the suppressors (13.38 +/- 3.30 micrograms/100 ml). Plasma ACTH and beta-endorphin responded in a coupled way to dexamethasone challenge. Higher basal levels of both peptides were found among PD patients (demented and nondemented), nonresponders to DST. Thus, the DST does not appear to be effective in differentiating between depression and dementia in PD. In addition, PD nonsuppressors showed higher basal values of plasma ACTH, beta-endorphin, and cortisol (similar to patients with major depression). This suggests that although the depression is clinically undetectable, both disorders may share some pathophysiological features at the hypothalamic hypophyseal adrenal level.",[],Biological psychiatry,1990-03-15,"[{'lastname': 'Rabey', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Clinical Chemistry, Tel-Aviv Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Scharf', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Oberman', 'firstname': 'Z', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zohar', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Graff', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0006-3223(90)90525-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de569090>

In this immunocytochemical study, we stained pineal glands from cases of AD and young and aged controls for cytoskeletal elements and amyloid. We found no evidence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) or the accumulation of neurofilaments, tau, A68, or beta/A4 amyloid deposition in pinealocytes or associated structures in cases of AD or controls. In both AD and controls, we observed dense immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilaments in marginal plexuses associated with processes of pinealocytes, boutons, and knob-like endings.

480,2202785,Disturbance of the 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism in brains from patients with Alzheimer's dementia.,"The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system in the human brain is sensitive to aging. In dementia of the Alzheimer type (AD/SDAT), there are significantly reduced concentrations of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). 5-HT-sensitive imipramine binding is reduced by almost 50%, indicating a loss of presynaptic 5-HT terminals. There also seems to be reduced tryptophan hydroxylase activity in some brain areas. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD/SDAT patients, the concentration of 5-HIAA is reduced, and the accumulation of 5-HIAA after probenecid loading is diminished. Biochemical findings together with structural findings in the raphe nuclei indicate that the disturbance of the 5-HT system is of the same magnitude as the disturbance of the cholinergic system. Reduced activity in the 5-HT system may be of importance for activity in the hypothalamus. There is an increased concentration of arginine vasopressin, which may explain the increased activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis seen in patients with AD/SDAT. This activity is reduced when a selective 5-HT reuptake blocker is given. Pharmacological treatment with 5-HT reuptake blockers improves emotional disturbances, confusion, anxiety and depressed mood in patients with AD/SDAT.",[],Journal of neural transmission.

Behavioral effects included increases in anxiety and decreases in mood, especially following the 0.5 micrograms dose. Physical side effects were modest.

3357484",Link between D1 and D2 dopamine receptors is reduced in schizophrenia and Huntington diseased brain.,"Dopamine receptor types D1 and D2 can oppose or enhance each other's actions for electrical, biochemical, and psychomotor effects. We report a D1-D2 interaction in homogenized tissue as revealed by ligand binding. D2 agonists lowered the binding of [3H]raclopride to D2 receptors in striatal and anterior pituitary tissues. Pretreating the tissue with the D1-selective antagonist SCH 23390 prevented the agonist-induced decrease in [3H]raclopride binding to D2 sites in the striatum but not in the anterior pituitary, which has no D1 receptors. Conversely, a dopamine-induced reduction in the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 to D1 receptors could be prevented by the D2-selective antagonist eticlopride. Receptor photolabeling experiments confirmed both these D1-D2 interactions. The blocking effect by SCH 23390 was similar to that produced by a nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogue, and SCH 23390 reduced the number of agonist-labeled D2 receptors in the high-affinity state. Thus, the D1-D2 link may be mediated by guanine nucleotide-binding protein components. The link may underlie D1-D2 interactions influencing behavior, since the link was missing in over half the postmortem striata from patients with schizophrenia and Huntington disease (both diseases that show some hyperdopamine signs) but was present in human control, Alzheimer, and Parkinson striata.",[],Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1989-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Seeman', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Niznik', 'firstname': 'H B', 'initials': 'HB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guan', 'firstname': 'H C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Booth', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ulpian', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1073/pnas.86.24.10156,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05da99f950>

When controls and patients with AD who experienced nausea (n = 2 and n = 6, respectively) were excluded, the arginine vasopressin, beta-endorphin, and epinephrine responses of patients with AD were significantly less than those of control subjects.

Since the origin of HA in the brain is dependent upon three main compartments (neuronal, mast cell, vascular smooth muscle), with approximately 60-80% of the total HA belonging to the neuronal pool, on the basis of neurochemical data we postulate that the increase in the levels of HA in SDAT might account for or be associated with alterations in neuroendocrine, cognitive, neurovascular and sleep-wakefulness functions.",[],Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,1989-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cacabelos', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Psychiatry Unit, Santiago University Medical School, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamatodani', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Niigawa', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hariguchi', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tada', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nishimura', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wada', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brandeis', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pearson', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df05b040>

The safety of m-CPP in elderly populations and its potential usefulness in exploring possible serotonergic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and normal aging were assessed by examining the behavioral, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of this agent in 15 elderly subjects (mean age 69 +/- 2 years): 9 Alzheimer patients and 6 healthy normal volunteers. Intravenous m-CPP (0.08 mg/kg) was well tolerated in all subjects and produced no serious adverse effects. The behavioral effects were modest; in particular, minimal anxiety was observed, a finding that contrasted to results from an earlier study reporting that intravenous m-CPP at a slightly higher dose induced marked anxiety and panic attacks in younger subjects. m-CPP produced significant increases in plasma cortisol and prolactin, and significant changes in blood pressure and temperature in these elderly subjects. The results of this preliminary study suggest that intravenous m-CPP is safe and well-tolerated in elderly subjects. Future studies at higher doses can now proceed to study more definitively the question of possible age- and disorder-related reductions in central nervous system (CNS) serotonergic responsivity.",[],Biological psychiatry,1989-03-15,"[{'lastname': 'Lawlor', 'firstname': 'B A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Unit on Geriatric Psychopharmacology, National Institute on Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.'}, {'lastname': 'Sunderland', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mellow', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hill', 'firstname': 'J L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Newhouse', 'firstname': 'P A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'D L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/0006-3223(89)90237-0,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df0449f0>

491,2930435,REM sleep deprivation increases early morning pineal melatonin in castrated rats.,"Recently nighttime melatonin levels have been shown to be attenuated in depressive patients or patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. On the other hand, depression can be transiently relieved by deprivation of rapid eye movement sleep. Since exogenous melatonin administration increases rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep in the rat, could rapid eye movement sleep deprivation then inversely influence endogenous melatonin production? We found indices that in castrated Wistar rats 4 days of rapid eye movement sleep deprivation by the cuff pedestal method elevates the pineal content of melatonin by a factor of two at 1 to 2 h after light onset. Rapid eye movement sleep is thus suggested to influence pineal activity. This mechanism might be involved in the human depression-alleviating effect of rapid eye movement sleep deprivation.",[],Behavioral and neural biology,1989-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Peder', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, University of Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Porkka-Heiskanen', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Alila', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Laakso', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Johansson', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1016/s0163-1047(89)90872-8,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df0615e0>
492,2690099,The relationship between cognitive impairment plasma cortisol levels and HPA responsibility to dexamethasone in dementia.,"Previous studies show an association between increased plasma cortisol levels and aging, a process which is also associated with some deterioration of cognition. Animal studies demonstrated damage to pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, secondary to increased cortisol secretion. Conditions in which high cortisol plasma levels are encountered suggest an association between elevated cortisol levels and cognitive impairment. 34 patients drug free for at least 10 days, were challenged by 0.5mg dexamethasone. Pre- and post-challenge cortisol plasma levels were determined by RIA. Cognitive functioning was assessed by the GDS (34 subjects) and later also by the MMSE (17 subjects). Mean GDS score was 5.2 +/- 1.1 (Mean +/- SD) and mean MMSE score was 11.3 +/- 5.8. Mean preDEX and postDEX cortisol plasma levels were 17.03 +/- 6.67 micrograms/dl and 9.95 +/- 6.70 micrograms/dl respectively. Grouping patients by severity of dysfunction, we found that the more severely impaired patients had significantly higher postDEX cortisol levels 7.04 +/- 6.25 vs 12.87 +/- 5.96 (t = -2.7 P less than 0.009 for the GDS scale and 5.74 +/- 6.1 vs 13.82 +/- 6.32, (t = 02.63 P less than 0.019 for the MMSE scale) but no significant difference for preDEX cortisol levels. The Index of HPA Responsivity, defined as: (PreDEX Cortisol-PostDEX Cortisol)/Pre DEX Cortisol+PostDEX Cortisol), was significantly lower for the more impaired patients indicating a less responsive HPA axis in those patients. Pearson correlation between the Index vs the GDS and MMSE scores was -0.43 (F = 7.11, P less than 0.012, n = 34) and 0.49 (F = 4.89, P less than 0.043, n = 17) respectively. Age did not seem to play an important role in this sample. These findings support a relationship between plasma cortisol levels and cognitive impairment. The Index of Responsivity, a dynamic measure of the system, is suggested for future studies.",[],Progress in clinical and biological research,1989-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Gurevitch', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry.'}, {'lastname': 'Siegel', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dumlao', 'firstname': 'M S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Perl', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chaitin', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bagne', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Oxenkrug', 'firstname': 'G F', 'initials': 'GF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc4cbcc0>
493,2566573,Somatostatin receptors in brain and pituitary.,"Somatostatin (SRIF) actions in the brain and pituitary are mediated by specific receptors. Using radioiodinated ligands it has been possible to characterize the kinetics of specific binding sites in the brain and pituitary, and to determine their cellular localization by autoradiography. At the pituitary level, the inhibition of growth hormone, prolactin and thyrotropin secretions induced by SRIF is mediated through a single binding site which is coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. In the brain, SRIF receptors are localized on neurons and glial cells and are also coupled to adenylate cyclase inhibition. Two sites are differentiated in the brain with an analogue of somatostatin, SMS 201995. In humans, SRIF-binding sites have been related to a number of pathologies. At the pituitary level, it has been shown that the number of binding sites was negatively correlated to growth hormone levels in acromegaly. Furthermore, SRIF-binding sites were undetectable in a patient which did not respond to SMS 201995 therapy. In the brain, meningiomas and gliomas are rich in SRIF binding sites. This suggests a possible role for SRIF on glia. In neurodegenerative diseases, cortical SRIF concentrations are decreased in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease associated with dementia while SRIF-binding sites are only affected in Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, the physiological role of SRIF in the brain and pituitary can be evaluated by studying the receptors of the peptide. Such studies allow to question the implication of SRIF in endocrine and neuropathologies.",[],Hormone research,1989-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Epelbaum', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'U 159, INSERM, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Agid', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Agid', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beaudet', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bertrand', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Enjalbert', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Heidet', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kordon', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Krantic', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Léonard', 'firstname': 'J F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1159/000181085,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc4afa90>

During the first 5 min after TRH infusion, significant increases from baseline in systolic BP (p less than 0.001), diastolic BP (p less than 0.001), and plasma NE (p less than 0.006) occurred in the study subjects. The magnitude of the BP and NE responses did not differ significantly as a function of TRH dose (p greater than 0.3). Diastolic pressor responses to TRH were substantially blunted in AD subjects relative to controls, after both the 0.1-mg (p less than 0.003) and 0.5-mg (p less than 0.02) doses. There were trends toward attenuated responses in the AD subjects for systolic BP (p less than 0.09) and plasma NE (p less than 0.07). Significant increments in serum PRL, LH, and FSH (all p less than 0.001) also occurred after TRH, but the magnitude of the hormone responses did not differ significantly between the AD and the normal subjects (p greater than 0.18).

Moreover, the hypothalamus also has pathological changes. In spite of these findings suggesting neuroendocrine dysfunctions, this function has seldom been investigated in AD patients so far. We have compared patients with clinically 'probable' AD of mild-to-moderate severity with nondemented age- and sex-matched controls.

Basal plasma levels of beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin were measured by RIA after high-performances liquid chromatography. Basal and stimulated plasma levels of PRL, GH, TSH and beta-lipotropin were similar in the two groups. Basal lamina levels of beta-endorphin were significantly higher in the patient group.

498,3132794,GHRH-induced GH response in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.,"To clarify the functional state of the somatotropinergic system at the hypothalamo-hypophyseal level in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, the GHRH test was performed in three groups of subjects: a) healthy elderly subjects; b) early onset senile dementia patients; and c) late onset senile dementia patients. Intravenous administration of GHRH(1-44)NH2 (100 micrograms) elicited a marked plasma GH response with a maximum peak (709.54 +/- 259.0 pmol/l; P less than 0.005) 60 min after injection in patients with early onset senile dementia, but no significant response was detected in the other two groups. Electroencephalographic recording showed that GHRH modifies brain bioelectrical activity, decreasing frequency (0.52 +/- 0.15 Hz) and increasing amplitude (8.25 +/- 4.5 microV) of the electroencephalogram basic rhythm. The evaluation of mental performance and behaviour with a battery of different tests for mental assessment revealed that GHRH induces transient clinical changes in psychomotor behaviour. According to these results, it seems likely that the somatostatin deficiency reported in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type may account for the enhanced GHRH-induced GH response observed in patients with early onset senile dementia. In consequence, the GHRH test might constitute a useful antemortem marker for senile dementia of the Alzheimer type if the present results can be replicated in early stages of the disease.",[],Acta endocrinologica,1988-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Cacabelos', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Niigawa', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ikemura', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yanagi', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tanaka', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Arnao', 'firstname': 'M D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gómez-Pan', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nishimura', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1530/acta.0.1170295,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc4b5450>
