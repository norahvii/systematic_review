0,38306301,Does hormone therapy impact cognition in patients with prostate cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Hormone therapy, which is widely prescribed for prostate cancer, might induce cognitive impairment and affect the autonomy of elderly patients. However, previous studies provided conflicting results. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the longitudinal impact of hormone therapy on objective (cognitive tests) and subjective (questionnaires) cognition.
A search was performed of the PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases. Studies that longitudinally assessed cognition in patients undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy and new-generation hormone therapy were considered. To perform a meta-analysis, available scores were aggregated and classified into six objective domains and one subjective domain. Weighted mean effect sizes were computed using a random effect model.
Twenty studies were included in the systematic review (1440 patients), and 15 could be included in the meta-analysis (1093 patients). In the systematic review, 20%-50% of patients had objective cognitive impairment before treatment initiation. The meta-analysis revealed a decline in subjective cognition (g = -0.44; p = .03) with androgen-deprivation therapy and new-generation hormone therapy. All other effect sizes were small (from g = -0.02 to g = 0.18), and none of them indicated a significant decline in objective cognition. Significant heterogeneity was observed in all domains of objective cognition.
This synthesis presents the first meta-analytic evidence of the negative impact of androgen-deprivation therapy and new-generation hormone therapy on subjective cognition. In contrast, there was no conclusive evidence of a decline in objective cognition. The high heterogeneity underscores the need for homogeneous cognitive research on prostate cancer.
There is no consensus on the cognitive impairment induced by hormone therapy for prostate cancer, despite the implications for patients' care and daily life. This synthesis of published studies demonstrated an increase in perceived cognitive difficulties but did not prove a decline in cognitive performance during treatment.","['androgen-deprivation therapy', 'cognitive impairment', 'hormone therapy', 'meta-analysis', 'new-generation hormone therapy', 'prostate cancer', 'subjective cognition']",Cancer,2024-02-02,"[{'lastname': 'Boué', 'firstname': 'Antoine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'INSERM 1086 Anticipe, UniCaen, Normandie University, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Joly', 'firstname': 'Florence', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'INSERM 1086 Anticipe, UniCaen, Normandie University, Caen, France.\nClinical Research Department, Baclesse Center, Caen, France.\nCancer and Cognition Platform, National League Against Cancer, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lequesne', 'firstname': 'Justine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Department, Baclesse Center, Caen, France.\nCancer and Cognition Platform, National League Against Cancer, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lange', 'firstname': 'Marie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'INSERM 1086 Anticipe, UniCaen, Normandie University, Caen, France.\nClinical Research Department, Baclesse Center, Caen, France.'}]",,,"Twenty studies were included in the systematic review (1440 patients), and 15 could be included in the meta-analysis (1093 patients).

1,38296783,Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.,"We describe congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is the most common primary adrenal insufficiency in children and adolescents. In this comprehensive review of CAH, we describe presentations at different life stages depending on disease severity. CAH is characterized by androgen excess secondary to impaired steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands. Diagnosis of CAH is most common during infancy with elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels on the newborn screen in the United States. However, CAH can also present in childhood, with late-onset symptoms such as premature adrenarche, growth acceleration, hirsutism, and irregular menses. The growing child with CAH is treated with hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid replacement, along with increased stress doses for acute illness, trauma, and procedures. Mineralocorticoid and salt replacement may also be necessary. Although 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common type of CAH, there are other rare types, such as 11β-hydroxylase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency. In addition, classic CAH is associated with long-term comorbidities, including cardiometabolic risk factors, impaired cognitive function, adrenal rest tumors, and bone health effects. Overall, early identification and treatment of CAH is important for the pediatric patient.",[],Pediatrics in review,2024-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Fraga', 'firstname': 'Nicole R', 'initials': 'NR', 'affiliation': ""Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.""}, {'lastname': 'Minaeian', 'firstname': 'Nare', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.\nKeck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.""}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Mimi S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': ""Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.\nKeck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.\nThe Saban Research Institute at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.""}]",,,,"© American Academy of Pediatrics, 2024.

2,38289246,Androgen treatment effects on neurocognition in female-to-male transgender adolescents.,"It has been hypothesized that cognitive and memory-related brain function in transgender during cross-sex hormonal treatment might be activated towards that of the subjective gender. However, research on this topic has produced inconsistent results, and to the best of our knowledge no studies have investigated neurocognitive changes in androgen-treated female-to-male (FM) transgender adolescents.
A total of 15 FM transgender adolescents (14-17 years) underwent neuropsychological testing in order to examine the effects of androgen on visuo-spacial abilities, verbal memory language, processing speed and executive functions. We used a longitudinal design in which 10 participants were tested twice, before and after receiving 12 months of testosterone treatment. This group was also compared with 5 FM transgender adolescents off-androgen treatment.
Participants tested before and after 12 months of androgen treatment improved significantly on processing speed in a visuo-spatial (Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test) and in a visuo-oral task (Stroop), their performance on a verbal memory task (TAVEC) and on interference (Stroop) and they exhibited lower impulsivity control (CARAS-R). On-androgen treatment adolescents exhibited worse cognitive impulsivity control than off-androgen treatment adolescents.
The results indicate that androgen has an influence on immediate verbal memory, cognitive interference, impulsivity control and processing speed.
Efectos del tratamiento con andrógenos sobre la neurocognición en adolescentes transgénero de mujer a hombre.
Introducción. Se ha planteado la hipótesis de que la neurocognición en personas transgénero durante el tratamiento hormonal cruzado podría aproximarse a la del género subjetivo. Sin embargo, la investigación sobre este tema ha producido resultados inconsistentes y, hasta donde sabemos, ningún estudio ha investigado los cambios neurocognitivos en adolescentes transgénero de mujer a hombre (FM) tratados con andrógenos. Sujetos y métodos. Quince adolescentes transgénero FM (14-17 años) se sometieron a pruebas neuropsicológicas para examinar los efectos de los andrógenos en sus habilidades visuoespaciales, memoria verbal, velocidad de procesamiento y funciones ejecutivas. Utilizamos un diseño longitudinal en el que se evaluó a 10 participantes dos veces, antes y después de recibir, durante 12 meses, tratamiento con testosterona. Este grupo también se comparó con cinco adolescentes transgénero FM sin tratamiento con andrógenos. Resultados. Los participantes evaluados antes y después de 12 meses de tratamiento con andrógenos mejoraron significativamente en velocidad de procesamiento en una tarea visuoespacial (prueba de la figura compleja de Rey-Osterrieth) y en una tarea visual (Stroop), en una tarea de memoria verbal (test de aprendizaje verbal España-Complutense) y en interferencia (Stroop), y exhibieron un menor control de la impulsividad (test de percepción de diferencias revisado). Los adolescentes que recibieron tratamiento con andrógenos mostraron un peor control de la impulsividad cognitiva que los adolescentes que no recibieron tratamiento con andrógenos. Conclusiones. Los resultados indican que los andrógenos influyen en la memoria verbal, la interferencia cognitiva, el control de la impulsividad y la velocidad de procesamiento.",[],Revista de neurologia,2024-01-30,"[{'lastname': 'Cuéllar-Flores', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Clínico San Carlos, 28035 Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Martín-Bejarano', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Clínico San Carlos, 28040 Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'García-Ron', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Clínico San Carlos, 28035 Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Villanueva', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Estupendamente, Cádiz, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Arias-Vivas', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Clínico San Carlos, 28040 Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'López-de Lara', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Clínico San Carlos, 28035 Madrid, España.'}]",,,"Participants tested before and after 12 months of androgen treatment improved significantly on processing speed in a visuo-spatial (Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test) and in a visuo-oral task (Stroop), their performance on a verbal memory task (TAVEC) and on interference (Stroop) and they exhibited lower impulsivity control (CARAS-R).

25383095",Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Focus on Cognitive Function and Mood.,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, and some studies have shown that the use of anti-androgen drugs is related to a reduction in cognitive function, mood changes, diminished quality of life, dementia, and possibly Alzheimer's disease. ADT has potential physiological effects such as a reduction in white matter integrity and a negative impact on hypothalamic functions due to the lowering of testosterone levels or the blockade of downstream androgen receptor signaling by first- and second-generation anti-androgen drugs. A comparative analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT and Alzheimer patients identified over 30 shared genes, illustrating common ground for the mechanistic underpinning of the symptomatology. The purpose of this review was to investigate the effects of ADT on cognitive function, mood, and quality of life, as well as to analyze the relationship between ADT and Alzheimer's disease. The evaluation of prostate cancer patient cognitive ability via neurocognitive testing is described. Future studies should further explore the connection among cognitive deficits, mood disturbances, and the physiological changes that occur when hormonal balance is altered.","['androgen deprivation therapy', 'cognitive function', 'hormonal therapies', 'management strategies', 'prostate cancer', 'testosterone']","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2024-01-23,"[{'lastname': 'Reiss', 'firstname': 'Allison B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gulkarov', 'firstname': 'Shelly', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pinkhasov', 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sheehan', 'firstname': 'Katie M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Srivastava', 'firstname': 'Ankita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'De Leon', 'firstname': 'Joshua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Katz', 'firstname': 'Aaron E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY 11501, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/medicina60010077

4,38229462,Testosterone replacement therapy: clinical considerations.,"As an increasingly popular therapeutic option, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has gained significant notoriety for its health benefits in indicated populations, such as those suffering from hypogonadism.
Benefits such as improved libido, muscle mass, cognition, and quality of life have led to widened public interest in testosterone as a health supplement. No therapy exists without side effects; testosterone replacement therapy has been associated with side effects such as an increased risk of polycythemia, benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and infertility. Testosterone replacement therapy is often accompanied by several prophylactic co-therapies aimed at reducing the prevalence of these side effects. Literature searches for sections on the clinical benefits and risks associated with TRT were performed to include clinical trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews from the last 10 years.
Data from clinical studies over the last decade suggest that the benefits of this therapy outweigh the risks and result in overall increased quality of life and remission of symptoms related to hypogonadism. With this in mind, the authors of this review suggest that carefully designed clinical trials are warranted for the investigation of TRT in symptomatic age-related hypogonadism.","['TRT', 'Testosterone', 'hypogonadism', 'prostate', 'testosterone replacement therapy']",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,2024-01-17,"[{'lastname': 'Luther', 'firstname': 'Patrick M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Spillers', 'firstname': 'Noah J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Talbot', 'firstname': 'Norris C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sinnathamby', 'firstname': 'Evan S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ellison', 'firstname': 'Dakota', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelkar', 'firstname': 'Rucha A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmadzadeh', 'firstname': 'Shahab', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shekoohi', 'firstname': 'Sahar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaye', 'firstname': 'Alan D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Anesthesiology and Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Neurosciences, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1080/14656566.2024.2306832,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de7c5db0>,,,,,,

This study investigated the effects of testosterone replacement and Spirulina Platensis association on testosterone deficiency-induced metabolic disorders and memory impairment.
Adult male rats were randomly and equally divided into four groups and received the following treatments for 20 consecutive days.
non-castrated rats received distilled water. Castrated group received distilled water. Testosterone treated group: castrated rats received 0.20 mg of testosterone dissolved in corn oil by subcutaneous injection (i.p.). Spirulina co-treated group: castrated rats received 0.20 mg of testosterone (i.p.) dissolved in corn oil followed by 1000 mg/kg of Spirulina per os.
Data showed that castration induced an increase in plasma ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (PAL), cholesterol, and triglycerides level. Castrated rats showed a great elevation in SOD and CAT activities and MDA and H2O2 levels in the prostate, seminal vesicles, and brain. Testosterone deficiency was also associated with alteration of the spatial memory and exploratory behaviour. Testosterone replacement either alone or with Spirulina combination efficiently improved most of these biochemical parameters and ameliorated cognitive abilities in castrated rats.

35963850",Hormonal basis of sex differences in anesthetic sensitivity.,"General anesthesia-a pharmacologically induced reversible state of unconsciousness-enables millions of life-saving procedures. Anesthetics induce unconsciousness in part by impinging upon sexually dimorphic and hormonally sensitive hypothalamic circuits regulating sleep and wakefulness. Thus, we hypothesized that anesthetic sensitivity should be sex-dependent and modulated by sex hormones. Using distinct behavioral measures, we show that at identical brain anesthetic concentrations, female mice are more resistant to volatile anesthetics than males. Anesthetic sensitivity is bidirectionally modulated by testosterone. Castration increases anesthetic resistance. Conversely, testosterone administration acutely increases anesthetic sensitivity. Conversion of testosterone to estradiol by aromatase is partially responsible for this effect. In contrast, oophorectomy has no effect. To identify the neuronal circuits underlying sex differences, we performed whole brain c-Fos activity mapping under anesthesia in male and female mice. Consistent with a key role of the hypothalamus, we found fewer active neurons in the ventral hypothalamic sleep-promoting regions in females than in males. In humans, we demonstrate that females regain consciousness and recover cognition faster than males after identical anesthetic exposures. Remarkably, while behavioral and neurocognitive measures in mice and humans point to increased anesthetic resistance in females, cortical activity fails to show sex differences under anesthesia in either species. Cumulatively, we demonstrate that sex differences in anesthetic sensitivity are evolutionarily conserved and not reflected in conventional electroencephalographic-based measures of anesthetic depth. This covert resistance to anesthesia may explain the higher incidence of unintended awareness under general anesthesia in females.","['EEG', 'behavior', 'hormones', 'sex differences', 'whole brain c-Fos imaging']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2024-01-08,"[{'lastname': 'Wasilczuk', 'firstname': 'Andrzej Z', 'initials': 'AZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nNeuroscience of Unconsciousness and Reanimation Research Alliance, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nDepartment of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.'}, {'lastname': 'Rinehart', 'firstname': 'Cole', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nNeuroscience of Unconsciousness and Reanimation Research Alliance, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.'}, {'lastname': 'Aggarwal', 'firstname': 'Adeeti', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nNeuroscience of Unconsciousness and Reanimation Research Alliance, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.'}, {'lastname': 'Stone', 'firstname': 'Martha E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nNeuroscience of Unconsciousness and Reanimation Research Alliance, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.'}, {'lastname': 'Mashour', 'firstname': 'George A', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Consciousness Science, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.'}, {'lastname': 'Avidan', 'firstname': 'Michael S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelz', 'firstname': 'Max B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nNeuroscience of Unconsciousness and Reanimation Research Alliance, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nMahoney Institute for Neurosciences, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.'}, {'lastname': 'Proekt', 'firstname': 'Alex', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nNeuroscience of Unconsciousness and Reanimation Research Alliance, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nMahoney Institute for Neurosciences, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nCenter for Consciousness Science, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.'}]",,,,,"10.1073/pnas.2312913120

7,38042455,"Games, hormones, and ""dark"" personalities: Dark tetrad and the effects of violent gaming on aggression, cortisol, and testosterone.","We investigated how playing a violent versus non-violent video game affects cortisol and testosterone levels, whether these hormonal changes increase implicit aggressive cognition, and whether so-called Dark Tetrad personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, everyday sadism) moderate these effects. Fifty-four men played either a violent or a non-violent video game for 25 min. Participants provided salivary samples at the beginning of the experiment (T1), after 25 min of gameplay (T2), and 20 min after gameplay ended (T3). In the violent condition, participants showed a significant decrease in cortisol levels (T1 to T2) and a significant negative trend in cortisol levels from T1 to T3. Moreover, higher Machiavellianism scores were related to a significantly stronger decrease in cortisol (T1 to T2) in this condition. In the non-violent condition, however, participants with higher scores in Machiavellianism had a higher increase in cortisol (T1 to T2). In contrast to changes in hormonal levels, there were no significant effects on implicit aggressive cognition. The present findings illustrate the complex interplay between personality, hormones, and game content, thus further specifying current notions on the effects of violent video games. Playing a violent video game can have a stress-reducing calming effect depending on personality traits such as Machiavellianism and the psychological need satisfaction associated with it.

22326707",Supraphysiological testosterone levels from anabolic steroid use and reduced sensitivity to negative facial expressions in men.,"Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are used to improve physical performance and appearance, but have been associated with deficits in social cognitive functioning. Approximately 30% of people who use AAS develop a dependence, increasing the risk for undesired effects.
To assess the relationship between AAS use (current/previous), AAS dependence, and the ability to recognize emotional facial expressions, and investigate the potential mediating role of hormone levels.
In total 156 male weightlifters, including those with current (n = 45) or previous (n = 34) AAS use and never-using controls (n = 77), completed a facial Emotion Recognition Task (ERT). Participants were presented with faces expressing one out of six emotions (sadness, happiness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise) and were instructed to indicate which of the six emotions each face displayed. ERT accuracy and response time were recorded and evaluated for association with AAS use status, AAS dependence, and serum reproductive hormone levels. Mediation models were used to evaluate the mediating role of androgens in the relationship between AAS use and ERT performance.
Compared to never-using controls, men currently using AAS exhibited lower recognition accuracy for facial emotional expressions, particularly anger (Cohen's d = -0.57, p
Our findings demonstrate impaired facial emotion recognition among men currently using AAS compared to controls. While further studies are needed to investigate potential mechanisms, our analysis did not support a simple mediation effect of serum FTI.","['Anabolic-androgenic steroids', 'Dependence', 'Emotion recognition', 'Social cognition', 'Testosterone']",Psychopharmacology,2023-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Scarth', 'firstname': 'Morgan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, Section for Clinical Addiction Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Postbox 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway. morsca@ous-hf.no.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. morsca@ous-hf.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Hauger', 'firstname': 'Lisa Evju', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, Section for Clinical Addiction Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Postbox 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Thorsby', 'firstname': 'Per Medbøe', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Hormone laboratory, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biochemical endocrinology and metabolism research group, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Leknes', 'firstname': 'Siri', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Diagnostic Physics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Hullstein', 'firstname': 'Ingunn R', 'initials': 'IR', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Doping Control Laboratory, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Westlye', 'firstname': 'Lars T', 'initials': 'LT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nNORMENT, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital & Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nKG Jebsen Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Bjørnebekk', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, Section for Clinical Addiction Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Postbox 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,,"Compared to never-using controls, men currently using AAS exhibited lower recognition accuracy for facial emotional expressions, particularly anger (Cohen's d = -0.57, p",© 2023.

22956822",Testosterone reduces hippocampal synaptic damage in an androgen receptor-independent manner.,"Aging-related reduction in androgen levels may be a possible risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to cognitive impairment. Androgens may affect synaptic function and cognition in an androgen receptor (AR)-independent manner; however, the mechanisms connecting theses effects are unknown. Therefore, we used testicular feminization mutation (Tfm) male mice, a model with AR mutation, to test the effects of testosterone on synaptic function and cognition. Our results showed that testosterone ameliorated spatial memory deficit and neuronal damage, and increased dendritic spines density and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) expression in the hippocampus of Tfm male mice. And these effects of testosterone were not inhibited by anastrozole, which suppressed conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Mechanistically, testosterone activated the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus of Tfm male mice. Meanwhile, Erk1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 blocked the upregulation of phospho-CREB, PSD95, and GluA1 induced by testosterone in HT22 cells pretreated with flutamide, an androgen antagonist. Collectively, our data indicate that testosterone may ameliorate hippocampal synaptic damage and spatial memory deficit by activating the Erk1/2-CREB signaling pathway in an AR-independent manner.","['Erk1/2–CREB signaling pathway', 'androgen receptor-independent manner', 'synaptic damage', 'testosterone']",The Journal of endocrinology,2023-11-22,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yizhou', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nHebei Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease Mechanism, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Meiqin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Huan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nHebei Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease Mechanism, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Mi', 'firstname': 'Shixiong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Chang', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nHebei Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease Mechanism, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zuo', 'firstname': 'Hongchun', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Leigang', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nHebei Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease Mechanism, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cui', 'firstname': 'Huixian', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nHebei Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease Mechanism, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Sha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\nHebei Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease Mechanism, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.'}]",,,,,"10.1530/JOE-23-0114

10,37981465,"The role of sex hormones, oral contraceptive use, and its parameters on visuospatial abilities, verbal fluency, and verbal memory.","Sex hormones can cross the blood-brain barrier and access brain regions underlying higher-order cognition. Containing synthetic sex hormones, oral contraceptives (OC) have been found to modulate visuospatial and verbal abilities, though inconsistencies have been found in the literature. Among possible explanations, certain OC use parameters (progestin androgenicity, synthetic hormone levels, duration of use) have not received consistent consideration. Thus, the objectives were to (1) examine group differences between men, combined OC users, and naturally cycling women (NC women; not using OC) in visuospatial abilities, verbal fluency, and verbal memory and (2) investigate the contribution of endogenous and exogenous sex hormones on these effects. We also aimed to (3) identify OC use parameters relevant to cognitive outcomes. In total, 70 combined OC users, 53 early follicular (EF) women, 43 pre-ovulatory (PO) women, and 47 men underwent cognitive tests. Performance was compared based on hormonal milieus (OC, EF, PO, men) and OC users' contraceptive androgenicity (anti, low, high). Correlations between performance, hormone levels and OC use duration were also conducted. OC use dampened the sex difference that typically favors men in 3D visuospatial abilities, whereas its duration of use positively predicted verbal fluency. Androgenicity and hormone levels did not predict performance in any task. These results highlight the importance of considering OC use duration. Results also did not support a role for androgenicity in cognition. Importantly, combined OC use (including prolonged use) does not impair visuospatial, verbal, and memory functions in a healthy young sample.","['Androgenicity', 'Cognition', 'Duration of use', 'Ethinyl estradiol', 'Fluency', 'Memory', 'Oral contraceptives', 'Verbal', 'Visuospatial']",Hormones and behavior,2023-11-20,"[{'lastname': 'Davignon', 'firstname': 'Lisa-Marie', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of the Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal, 7331 Hochelaga Street, Montreal H1N 3J4, Canada; Department of Psychology, Université du Québec à Montréal, 100 Sherbrooke Street W, Montreal H2X 2P3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Brouillard', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of the Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal, 7331 Hochelaga Street, Montreal H1N 3J4, Canada; Department of Psychology, Université du Québec à Montréal, 100 Sherbrooke Street W, Montreal H2X 2P3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Juster', 'firstname': 'Robert-Paul', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of the Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal, 7331 Hochelaga Street, Montreal H1N 3J4, Canada; Department of Psychiatry and Addiction, Université de Montréal, 2900 Edouard-Montpetit Boulevard, Montreal H3T 1J4, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Marin', 'firstname': 'Marie-France', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of the Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal, 7331 Hochelaga Street, Montreal H1N 3J4, Canada; Department of Psychology, Université du Québec à Montréal, 100 Sherbrooke Street W, Montreal H2X 2P3, Canada; Department of Psychiatry and Addiction, Université de Montréal, 2900 Edouard-Montpetit Boulevard, Montreal H3T 1J4, Canada.

11,37979822,"Sex steroid hormones, the estrous cycle, and rapid modulation of glutamatergic synapse properties in the striatal brain regions with a focus on 17β-estradiol and the nucleus accumbens.","The striatal brain regions encompassing the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), shell (NAcs) and caudate-putamen (CPu) regulate cognitive functions including motivated behaviors, habit, learning, and sensorimotor action, among others. Sex steroid hormone sensitivity and sex differences have been documented in all of these functions in both normative and pathological contexts, including anxiety, depression and addiction. The neurotransmitter glutamate has been implicated in regulating these behaviors as well as striatal physiology, and there are likewise documented sex differences in glutamate action upon the striatal output neurons, the medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Here we review the available data regarding the role of steroid sex hormones such as 17β-estradiol (estradiol), progesterone, and testosterone in rapidly modulating MSN glutamatergic synapse properties, presented in the context of the estrous cycle as appropriate. Estradiol action upon glutamatergic synapse properties in female NAcc MSNs is most comprehensively discussed. In the female NAcc, MSNs exhibit development period-specific sex differences and estrous cycle variations in glutamatergic synapse properties as shown by multiple analyses, including that of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Estrous cycle-differences in NAcc MSN mEPSCs can be mimicked by acute exposure to estradiol or an ERα agonist. The available evidence, or lack thereof, is also discussed concerning estrogen action upon MSN glutamatergic synapse in the other striatal regions as well as the underexplored roles of progesterone and testosterone. We conclude that there is strong evidence regarding estradiol action upon glutamatergic synapse function in female NAcs MSNs and call for more research regarding other hormones and striatal regions.","['Estradiol', 'Estrogen receptors', 'Estrous cycle', 'Nucleus accumbens', 'Sex differences']",Steroids,2023-11-19,"[{'lastname': 'Proaño', 'firstname': 'Stephanie B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'Christiana K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Krentzel', 'firstname': 'Amanda A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Office of Research and Innovation, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorris', 'firstname': 'David M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Meitzen', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Comparative Medicine Institute, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Center for Human Health and the Environment, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.

12,37964596,Management aspects of congenital adrenal hyperplasia during adolescence and transition to adult care.,"The adolescent period is characterised by fundamental hormonal changes, which affect sex steroid production, cortisol metabolism and insulin sensitivity. These physiological changes have a significant impact on patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). An essential treatment aim across the lifespan in patients with CAH is to replace glucocorticoids sufficiently to avoid excess adrenal androgen production but equally to avoid cardiometabolic risks associated with excess glucocorticoid intake. The changes to the hormonal milieu at puberty, combined with poor adherence to medical therapy, often result in unsatisfactory control exacerbating androgen excess and increasing the risk of metabolic complications due to steroid over-replacement. With the physical and cognitive maturation of the adolescent with CAH, fertility issues and sexual function become a new focus of patient care in the paediatric clinic. This requires close surveillance for gonadal dysfunction, such as irregular periods/hirsutism or genital surgery-associated symptoms in girls and central hypogonadism or testicular adrenal rest tumours in boys. To ensure good health outcomes across the lifespan, the transition process from paediatric to adult care of patients with CAH must be planned carefully and early from the beginning of adolescence, spanning over many years into young adulthood. Its key aims are to empower the young person through education with full disclosure of their medical history, to ensure appropriate follow-up with experienced physicians and facilitate access to multispecialist teams addressing the complex needs of patients with CAH.","['21-hydroxylase deficiency', 'androgens', 'cortisol', 'glucocorticoid', 'puberty']",Clinical endocrinology,2023-11-15,"[{'lastname': 'Balagamage', 'firstname': 'Chamila', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Arshad', 'firstname': 'Amynta', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nThe Medical School, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Elhassan', 'firstname': 'Yasir S', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.\nInstitute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ben Said', 'firstname': 'Wogud', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.\nInstitute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Krone', 'firstname': 'Ruth E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Gleeson', 'firstname': 'Helena', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Idkowiak', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.\nInstitute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.""}]",,,,© 2023 The Authors.

8755481",Steroid Hormone Interaction with Dendritic Spines: Implications for Neuropsychiatric Disease.,"Dendritic spines, key sites for neural plasticity, are influenced by gonadal steroids. In this chapter, we review the effects of gonadal steroids on dendritic spine density in areas important to cognitive function, the hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Most of these animal model studies investigated the effects of estrogen in females, but we also include more recent data on androgen effects in both males and females. The underlying genomic and non-genomic mechanisms related to gonadal steroid-induced spinogenesis are also reviewed. Subsequently, we discuss possible reasons for the observed sex differences in many neuropsychiatric diseases, which appear to be caused, in part, by aberrant synaptic connections that may involve dendritic spine pathology. Overall, knowledge concerning the regulation of dendritic spines by gonadal hormones has grown since the initial discoveries in the 1990s, and current research points to a potential role for aberrant spine functioning in many neuropsychiatric disorders.","['Androgen', 'Dendritic spine', 'Estrogen', 'Hippocampus', 'Neural plasticity', 'Prefrontal cortex', 'Stress']",Advances in neurobiology,2023-11-14,"[{'lastname': 'Frankfurt', 'firstname': 'Maya', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Hofstra Northwell School of Nursing and Physician Assistant Studies, Hempstead, NY, USA. maya.frankfurt@hofstra.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Nassrallah', 'firstname': 'Zeinab', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Science Education Zucker School of Medicine, 500 Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Luine', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Hunter College, New York, NY, USA.'}]",,,,"© 2023.

28814281",A review of the objective cognitive function measurements in males receiving hormonal therapy for prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is more common in the older population and the use of hormonal therapy in PC can increase medical frailty and cognitive decline. This narrative review examines the impact of androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs) and next-generational hormonal therapies (NGHT) on cognitive function outcomes amongst patients with hormone-sensitive or castrate-resistant PC.
Six electronic databases were searched from January 2000 to June 2022 for quantitative studies to evaluate the impacts of hormonal therapies (ADT, combined androgen blockade, and NGHT) on cognitive functions in men with PC.
Of the 36 studies identified, 20 studies reported no effect of hormonal therapies on any cognitive domain while 16 studies found possible declines in at least one domain. The domains assessed were highly variable and objective assessment measurements were not standardized or widely adopted. While the results have been inconsistent, a relationship between declining androgen levels and poorer performances in the visuospatial and visual memory domains has been highlighted. It was not possible to distinguish the degree of cognitive parameter changes between the populations of hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant PC.
While the exact impact of ADT and NGHT on cognitive function in men with PC remains controversial, appropriate care should be undertaken especially in older and frail individuals, specifically in those with progressive or established visuospatial or visual memory deficits.","['Aging', 'Androgen', 'Memory', 'Prostatic neoplasms']",Investigative and clinical urology,2023-11-07,"[{'lastname': 'Neerhut', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital Brisbane QLD Australia, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Brian Ng Hung', 'initials': 'BNH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital Brisbane QLD Australia, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rhee', 'firstname': 'Handoo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital Brisbane QLD Australia, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Eric', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital Brisbane QLD Australia, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.\nAndroUrology Centre, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. ericchg@hotmail.com.'}]",,,"Of the 36 studies identified, 20 studies reported no effect of hormonal therapies on any cognitive domain while 16 studies found possible declines in at least one domain.

29778388",Overactivation of GnRH neurons is sufficient to trigger polycystic ovary syndrome-like traits in female mice.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder leading to anovulatory infertility. Abnormalities in the central neuroendocrine system governed by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons might be related to ovarian dysfunction in PCOS, although the link in this disordered brain-to-ovary communication remains unclear. Here, we manipulated GnRH neurons using chemogenetics in adult female mice to unveil whether chronic overaction of these neurons would trigger PCOS-like hormonal and reproductive impairments.
We used adult Gnrh1
We discovered that the overactivation of GnRH neurons was sufficient to disrupt reproductive cycles, promote hyperandrogenism, and induce ovarian dysfunction. These PCOS features were detected with a long-lasting neuroendocrine dysfunction through abnormally high luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse secretion. Additionally, the GnRH-R blockade prevented the establishment of long-term neuroendocrine dysfunction and androgen excess in these animals.
Taken together, our results show that hyperactivity of hypothalamic GnRH neurons is a major driver of reproductive and hormonal impairments in PCOS and suggest that antagonizing the aberrant GnRH signaling could be an efficient therapeutic venue for the treatment of PCOS.

35227621",Testosterone and the Amygdala's Functional Connectivity in Women and Men.,"The amygdala contains androgen receptors and is involved in various affective and social functions. An interaction between testosterone and the amygdala's functioning is likely. We investigated the amygdala's resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) network in association with testosterone in 94 healthy young adult women and men (final data available for analysis from 42 women and 39 men). Across the whole sample, testosterone was positively associated with the rsFC between the right amygdala and the right middle occipital gyrus, and it further predicted lower agreeableness scores. Significant sex differences appeared for testosterone and the functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), showing higher testosterone levels with lower connectivity in women. Sex further predicted the openness and agreeableness scores. Our results show that testosterone modulates the rsFC between brain areas involved in affective processing and executive functions. The data indicate that the cognitive control of the amygdala via the frontal cortex is dependent on the testosterone levels in a sex-specific manner. Testosterone seems to express sex-specific patterns (1) in networks processing affect and cognition, and (2) in the frontal down-regulation of the amygdala. The sex-specific coupling between the amygdala and the frontal cortex in interaction with the hormone levels may drive sex-specific differences in a variety of behavioral phenomena that are further associated with psychiatric illnesses that show sex-specific prevalence rates.","['amygdala', 'frontal cortex', 'functional connectivity', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'gender', 'occipital cortex', 'personality', 'resting-state', 'sex', 'testosterone']",Journal of clinical medicine,2023-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Kogler', 'firstname': 'Lydia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Tübingen Centre for Mental Health (TüCMH), Medical Faculty, University of Tübingen, Calwerstrasse 14, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.\nGerman Center for Mental Health (DZPG) Partner Site, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Müller', 'firstname': 'Veronika I', 'initials': 'VI', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine: Brain and Behavior (INM-7), Research Centre Jülich, 52425 Jülich, Germany.\nInstitute of Systems Neuroscience, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Moorenstraße 5, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Moser', 'firstname': 'Ewald', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'High-Field MR Center, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Windischberger', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'High-Field MR Center, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Gur', 'firstname': 'Ruben C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Brain Behavior Laboratory and Neurodevelopment and Psychosis Section, Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Habel', 'firstname': 'Ute', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074 Aachen, Germany.\nJARA BRAIN Institute I, Translational Brain Medicine, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, 52425 Jülich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Eickhoff', 'firstname': 'Simon B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine: Brain and Behavior (INM-7), Research Centre Jülich, 52425 Jülich, Germany.\nInstitute of Systems Neuroscience, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Moorenstraße 5, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Derntl', 'firstname': 'Birgit', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Tübingen Centre for Mental Health (TüCMH), Medical Faculty, University of Tübingen, Calwerstrasse 14, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.\nGerman Center for Mental Health (DZPG) Partner Site, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.\nLEAD Graduate School and Network, University of Tübingen, Walter-Simon-Straße 12, 72074 Tübingen, Germany.\nInternational Max Planck Research School for the Mechanisms of Mental Function and Dysfunction (IMPRS-MMFD), Otfried-Müller-Str. 27, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/jcm12206501

17,37866084,Effect of short-term androgen supplementation on cognitive performance in older male rhesus macaques.,"Old male rhesus macaques often show cognitive impairment, and also have attenuated circulating levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). However, it is unclear if these age-associated decreases in circulating androgen levels are casually related to mechanisms that support cognition. To test this possibility, old male rhesus macaques were given daily supplements of testosterone and DHEA for ∼7 months, using a paradigm designed to mimic the 24-hour circulating hormone patterns of young adults. Animals completed the Delayed Match-to-Sample (DMS) task to assess recognition, and the Delayed Response (DR) task to assess working memory. The animals all showed significant delay-dependent performance, with longer delays resulting in lower accuracy; and timepoint-dependent performance, showing improvement with the repeated opportunities for practice. However, there were no differences between the androgen supplemented animals and age-matched controls. These data indicate that the specific short-term supplementation paradigm employed here offers no obvious benefits for DMS or DR task performance.","['Aging', 'Androgens', 'Cognition', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone', 'Rhesus macaque', 'Testosterone']",Neurobiology of aging,2023-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Weiss', 'firstname': 'Alison Ruth', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Beaverton, OR, USA.

18,37845136,EMAS position statement: Testosterone replacement therapy in older men.,"Late-onset hypogonadism is the clinical entity characterised by low testosterone concentrations associated with clinical symptoms in the absence of organic disease in ageing men. It has been associated with metabolic syndrome, reduced bone mineral density, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Although testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) reverses most of these conditions in young hypogonadal men, the risk/benefit ratio of TRT in older men is debatable.
To update the 2015 EMAS statement on TRT in older men with new research on late-onset hypogonadism and TRT.
Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.
TRT should be offered only to symptomatic older men with confirmed low testosterone concentrations after explaining the uncertainties regarding the long-term safety of this treatment. TRT may be offered to men with severe hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction to improve sexual desire, erectile, and orgasmic function. It should also be considered in hypogonadal men with severe insulin resistance or pre-diabetes mellitus. TRT may also be considered, in combination with proven treatment strategies, for osteoporosis, or for selected patients with persistent mild depressive symptoms and/or low self-perceived quality of life, combined with standard medical care for each condition. TRT is contraindicated in hypogonadal men actively seeking fertility treatment. Due to a lack of data, TRT should not be routinely used in older men to improve exercise capacity/physical function, improve cognitive function, or prevent cognitive decline. TRT must be avoided in older, frail men with known breast cancer or untreated prostate cancer and all men who have had myocardial infarction or stroke within the last four months, and those with severe or decompensated heart failure. The quality of evidence regarding patients with previous prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease is too low to draw definitive conclusions. Any limits on duration of use are arbitrary, and treatment should continue for as long as the man feels the benefits outweigh the risks for him, and decisions must be made on an individual basis. Withdrawal should be considered when hypogonadism is reversed after the resolution of underlying disorder. Short-acting transdermal preparations should be preferred for TRT initiation in older men, but injectable forms may be considered subsequently. Older men on TRT should be monitored at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation and at least yearly thereafter, or earlier and more frequently if indicated. Evaluation should include assessment of the clinical response, and measurement of total testosterone, haematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations. Bone density and/or quality should also be assessed.

36153222",Long-term effects of COVID-19 on the endocrine system - a pilot case-control study.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has permanently changed the world. Despite having been a pandemic for nearly 3 years, the mid- and long-term complications of this disease, including endocrine disorders, remain unclear. Our study aimed to evaluate the lasting effects of COVID-19 on the endocrine system 6 months after initial infection.
We compared patients who underwent COVID-19 to age- and sex-matched subjects from a population-based study conducted before the pandemic. We evaluated differences in multiple parameters related to metabolism and the endocrine system including fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, body composition, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), anti-thyroglobulin (aTG) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (aTPO) antibodies, prolactin, cortisol, testosterone, and estradiol.
We found significantly lower levels of fT3 and fT4, accompanied by higher levels of TSH and aTPO antibodies, in COVID-19 survivors. Moreover, we found that patients who underwent SARS-CoV2 infection had higher levels of prolactin and lower levels of testosterone than controls. Interestingly, differences in testosterone levels were observed only in male subjects. We did not detect significant differences in body composition or metabolic and glycemic parameters between cases and controls, except for significantly higher values of the HOMA2-B index in COVID-19 survivors.
Our study indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection might have long-term consequences on the endocrine system, including the suppressed function of the thyroid gland, prolactin, and male sex hormone secretion. Moreover, we showed that in a 6-month follow-up, COVID-19 had no consequences on glycemic parameters, lipid profiles, liver function, body composition, cortisol levels, and estradiol levels.","['COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'diabetes', 'endocrine system', 'obesity', 'thyroid hormones']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Szczerbiński', 'firstname': 'Łukasz', 'initials': 'Ł', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.\nCenter for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.\nPrograms in Metabolism and Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Okruszko', 'firstname': 'Michał Andrzej', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.\nDoctoral School at the Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Szabłowski', 'firstname': 'Maciej', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sołomacha', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Doctoral School at the Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.\nDepartment of Population Medicine and Lifestyle Diseases Prevention, Medical University of Bialystok, Białystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sowa', 'firstname': 'Paweł', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Medicine and Lifestyle Diseases Prevention, Medical University of Bialystok, Białystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiszkiel', 'firstname': 'Łukasz', 'initials': 'Ł', 'affiliation': 'Society and Cognition Unit, University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gościk', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Krętowski', 'firstname': 'Adam Jacek', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Moniuszko-Malinowska', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfections, Medical University of Bialystok, Białystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamiński', 'firstname': 'Karol', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Medicine and Lifestyle Diseases Prevention, Medical University of Bialystok, Białystok, Poland.\nDepartment of Cardiology, University Hospital of Bialystok, Białystok, Poland.'}]",,"Our study indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection might have long-term consequences on the endocrine system, including the suppressed function of the thyroid gland, prolactin, and male sex hormone secretion.

9095563",Effects of vortioxetine on hippocampal-related cognitive impairment induced in rats by androgen deprivation as a model of prostate cancer treatment.,"Advances in prostate cancer treatment have significantly improved survival, but quality of life for survivors remains an under-studied area of research. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a foundational treatment for advanced prostate cancer and is used as an adjuvant for prolonged periods in many high-risk, localized tumors. More than half of patients treated with ADT experience debilitating cognitive impairments in domains such as spatial learning and working memory. In this study, we investigated the effects of androgen deprivation on hippocampal-mediated cognition in rats. Vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant, has been shown to improve cognition in depressed patients. Thus, we also tested the potential efficacy of vortioxetine in restoring impaired cognition after ADT. We further investigated mechanisms that might contribute to these effects, measuring changes in the circuitry and gene expression within the dorsal hippocampus. ADT via surgical castration induced impairments in visuospatial cognition on the novel object location test and attenuated afferent-evoked local field potentials recorded in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus. Chronic dietary administration of vortioxetine effectively reversed these deficits. Castration significantly altered gene expression in the hippocampus, whereas vortioxetine had little effect. Pathway analysis revealed that androgen depletion altered pathways related to synaptic plasticity. These results suggest that the hippocampus may be vulnerable to ADT, contributing to cognitive impairment in prostate cancer patients. Further, vortioxetine may be a candidate to improve cognition in patients who experience cognitive decline after androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and may do so by restoring molecular and circuit-level plasticity-related mechanisms compromised by ADT.",[],Translational psychiatry,2023-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Vaiana', 'firstname': 'Alexandra M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.\nCenter for Biomedical Neuroscience, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.\nMays Cancer Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yidong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.\nDepartment of Population Health Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Gelfond', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson-Pais', 'firstname': 'Teresa L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Mays Cancer Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.\nDepartment of Urology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Leach', 'firstname': 'Robin J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Mays Cancer Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.\nDepartment of Cell Systems & Anatomy, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramamurthy', 'firstname': 'Chethan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Mays Cancer Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'Ian M', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Morilak', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.

30822410",Changes to hypothalamic volume and associated subunits during gender-affirming hormone therapy.,"Among its pleiotropic properties, gender-affirming hormone therapy (GHT) affects regional brain volumes. The hypothalamus, which regulates neuroendocrine function and associated emotional and cognitive processes, is an intuitive target for probing GHT effects. We sought to assess changes to hypothalamus and hypothalamic subunit volumes after GHT, thereby honouring the region's anatomical and functional heterogeneity.
Individuals with gender dysphoria and cisgender controls underwent 2 MRI measurements, with a median interval of 145 days (interquartile range [IQR] 128.25-169.75 d, mean 164.94 d) between the first and second MRI. Transgender women (TW) and transgender men (TM) underwent the first MRI before GHT and the second MRI after approximately 4.5 months of GHT, which comprised estrogen and anti-androgen therapy in TW or testosterone therapy in TM. Hypothalamic volumes were segmented using FreeSurfer, and effects of GHT were tested using repeated-measures analysis of covariance.
The final sample included 106 participants: 38 TM, 15 TW, 32 cisgender women (CW) and 21 cisgender men (CM). Our analyses revealed group × time interaction effects for total, left and right hypothalamus volume, and for several subunits (left and right inferior tubular, left superior tubular, right anterior inferior, right anterior superior, all 
We did not address the influence of transition-related psychological and behavioural changes.
Our results suggest a subunit-specific effect of GHT on hypothalamus volumes in TW.

In the current study, we aimed to clarify the cognitive-behavioral profile of peripubertal boys with KS using measures of cognition, academic achievement, adaptive behavior, and quality of life.
We compared 47 boys with KS (7-16 years of age) with 55 performance IQ-matched boys without KS on measures of cognition (WISC-V), executive function (BRIEF-2), academic achievement (KTEA-3), adaptive behavior (Vineland-3), and quality of life (PROMIS). In exploratory analyses, we examined associations among these measures and potential associations with pubertal metrics.
Boys with KS demonstrated a significantly different profile of cognition, behavioral ratings of executive function, academic achievement, adaptive behavior, and quality of life compared with their typically developing peers, with, on average, lower functioning. The groups showed significantly different correlations between cognition and aspects of quality of life. No associations were observed between behavior and pubertal development.
Taken together, these findings indicated that boys with KS are at increased risk for cognitive difficulties, which may affect academic achievement, adaptive behavior, and quality of life. Although initial exploratory analyses indicated that the magnitude of these alterations was not correlated with severity of testicular failure, longitudinal analyses currently being conducted by our group may help clarify the trajectory of these difficulties through the pubertal transition and testosterone replacement.",[],Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,2023-09-11,"[{'lastname': 'Jordan', 'firstname': 'Tracy L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Center of Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.'}, {'lastname': 'Foland-Ross', 'firstname': 'Lara C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Center of Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wun', 'firstname': 'Vanessa L', 'initials': 'VL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.'}, {'lastname': 'Ross', 'firstname': 'Judith L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE.'}, {'lastname': 'Reiss', 'firstname': 'Allan L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Center of Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.\nDepartment of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA; and.\nCenter for Academic Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.'}]","We compared 47 boys with KS (7-16 years of age) with 55 performance IQ-matched boys without KS on measures of cognition (WISC-V), executive function (BRIEF-2), academic achievement (KTEA-3), adaptive behavior (Vineland-3), and quality of life (PROMIS).

23,37672935,Social avoidance and testosterone enhanced exposure efficacy in women with social anxiety disorder: A pilot investigation.,"Social avoidance has been associated with more persistent social anxiety disorder (SAD) symptoms and low testosterone levels in individuals with SAD. We tested whether pre-treatment avoidance tendencies moderate the efficacy of testosterone-augmented exposure therapy. Fifty-five females with SAD received two exposure sessions during which fear levels were assessed. Session 1 was augmented with testosterone (0.50 mg) or placebo. Avoidance tendencies and symptom severity were assessed pre- and post-exposure. Participants showed stronger avoidance for social versus non-social stimuli and this tendency remained stable over time. Stronger pretreatment avoidance tendencies were associated with larger fear reduction in the testosterone but not the placebo condition. This effect did not transfer to the second non-enhanced session or symptom severity. The findings support the hypothesis that individuals suffering from SAD with relatively stronger pretreatment avoidance tendencies benefit more from testosterone-augmentation, pointing to a potential behavioral marker for testosterone enhancement of exposure therapy.","['Avoidance', 'Exposure', 'Social anxiety', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2023-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Hutschemaekers', 'firstname': 'Moniek H M', 'initials': 'MHM', 'affiliation': 'Overwaal Centre of Expertise for Anxiety Disorders, OCD and PTSD, Pro Persona Institute for Integrated Mental Health Care, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

31961002",Evidence for adolescent length growth spurts in bonobos and other primates highlights the importance of scaling laws.,"Adolescent growth spurts (GSs) in body length seem to be absent in non-human primates and are considered a distinct human trait. However, this distinction between present and absent length-GSs may reflect a mathematical artefact that makes it arbitrary. We first outline how scaling issues and inappropriate comparisons between length (linear) and weight (volume) growth rates result in misleading interpretations like the absence of length-GSs in non-human primates despite pronounced weight-GSs, or temporal delays between length- and weight-GSs. We then apply a scale-corrected approach to a comprehensive dataset on 258 zoo-housed bonobos that includes weight and length growth as well as several physiological markers related to growth and adolescence. We found pronounced GSs in body weight and length in both sexes. Weight and length growth trajectories corresponded with each other and with patterns of testosterone and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 levels, resembling adolescent GSs in humans. We further re-interpreted published data of non-human primates, which showed that aligned GSs in weight and length exist not only in bonobos. Altogether, our results emphasize the importance of considering scaling laws when interpreting growth curves in general, and further show that pronounced, human-like adolescent length-GSs exist in bonobos and probably also many other non-human primates.","['Pan paniscus', 'evolutionary biology', 'length growth', 'ontogeny', 'physiological non-invasive marker', 'scaling issues', 'weight growth']",eLife,2023-09-05,"[{'lastname': 'Berghaenel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Domestication Lab, Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology, Department of Interdisciplinary Life Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Stevens', 'firstname': 'Jeroen M G', 'initials': 'JMG', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Ecology and Ecophysiology, Department of Biology, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nCentre for Research and Conservation, Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nSALTO Agro- and Biotechnology, Odisee University of Applied Sciences, Sint-Niklaas, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Hohmann', 'firstname': 'Gottfried', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany.\nMax-Planck-Institute of Animal Behaviour, Radolfzell, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Deschner', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany.\nComparative BioCognition, Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Behringer', 'firstname': 'Verena', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany.\nEndocrinology Laboratory, German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Göttingen, Germany.\nLeibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition, German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Göttingen, Germany.'}]",,,,"© 2023, Berghaenel, Stevens et al.","10.7554/eLife.86635

18202581",Effect of exercise on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis dysregulation was suggested to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the effects of exercise on HPG hormones in an AD rat model, as a possible mechanism underlying the favorable effect of exercise on AD. Forty male Wistar albino rats 2-3 months old were subdivided randomly into two groups (n = 20 each): AD group (injected intraperitoneally with aluminum chloride (70 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks) and Control group. Each group was subdivided into exercised or non-exercised group (n = 10 each). Exercised groups were subjected to a swimming protocol (60 min/day, 5 days/week, 4 weeks). Serum HPG hormones, hippocampal β-amyloid levels and Morris water-maze cognition were assessed. Results demonstrated higher levels of β-amyloid, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) together with lower testosterone levels and cognitive impairment in the AD rats compared to controls. Β-amyloid levels negatively correlated with testosterone levels and positively correlated with GnRH, LH and FSH among the AD rats. Higher testosterone and lower GnRH, LH, FSH and β-amyloid levels, as well as cognitive improvement, were observed in the exercised compared to non-exercised AD rats, suggesting a modulatory role of exercise training on AD-associated HPG axis dysregulation.",[],Scientific reports,2023-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Khairy', 'firstname': 'Eman Y', 'initials': 'EY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, 165, Horreya Avenue, Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt. eman.hassan@alexu.edu.eg.'}, {'lastname': 'Salama', 'firstname': 'Ola A', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, 165, Horreya Avenue, Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt.'}]",,,,© 2023.

22333574",Executive Dysfunction in Klinefelter Syndrome: Associations With Brain Activation and Testicular Failure.,"Executive dysfunction is a well-recognized component of the cognitive phenotype of Klinefelter syndrome (KS), yet the neural basis of KS-associated cognitive weaknesses, and their association with testicular failure is unknown.
We investigated executive function, brain activation, and pubertal development in adolescents with and without KS.
Forty-three adolescents with KS (mean age 12.3 ± 2.3 years) and 41 typically developing boys (mean age 11.9 ± 1.8 years) underwent pubertal evaluation, behavioral assessment, and completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they performed an executive function task, the go/no-go task. Group differences in activation were examined. Associations among activation, executive function, and pubertal development measures were tested in secondary analyses.
Boys with KS exhibited reduced executive function, as well as lower activation in brain regions subserving executive function, including the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and caudate nucleus. Secondary analyses indicated that the magnitude of activation differences in boys with KS was associated with severity of pubertal developmental delay, as indexed by lower testosterone (t(36) = 2.285; P = .028) and lower testes volume (t(36) = 2.238; P = .031). Greater parent-reported attention difficulties were additionally associated with lower testicular volume (t(36) = -2.028; P = .050).
These findings indicate a neural basis for executive dysfunction in KS and suggest alterations in pubertal development may contribute to increased severity of this cognitive weakness. Future studies that examine whether these patterns change with testosterone replacement therapy are warranted.","['Klinefelter syndrome', 'brain', 'executive function', 'fMRI', 'inhibition', 'sex chromosome aneuploidy']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'Foland-Ross', 'firstname': 'Lara C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghasemi', 'firstname': 'Elnaz', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lozano Wun', 'firstname': 'Vanessa', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aye', 'firstname': 'Tandy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 93405, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kowal', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Nemours Children's Hospital Delaware, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Ross', 'firstname': 'Judith', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Nemours Children's Hospital Delaware, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Reiss', 'firstname': 'Allan L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 93405, USA.\nDepartment of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.'}]",,These findings indicate a neural basis for executive dysfunction in KS and suggest alterations in pubertal development may contribute to increased severity of this cognitive weakness.

21080048",Finger-Length Ratios and Sexual Orientation in Southern Spain: A Large Sample Study on Sex-Linked Personality and Cognitive Traits.,"Some similarities between sex differences and sexual orientation differences, with gay men shifted in female-typical directions and lesbians shifted in male-typical directions, have been hypothesized to reflect the effects of prenatal androgen exposure. This report assessed sex-linked personality and cognitive traits in a Spanish sample of 1117 straight (i.e., heterosexual) and non-straight (i.e., non-heterosexual) men and women, using finger-length ratio (2D:4D) as an index of prenatal androgen exposure. Observed sex differences were in the expected direction: Measures of right-hand 2D:4D, left-hand 2D:4D, and anxiety were higher in straight women than men, whereas impulsivity, dominance, cognitive reflection, and mathematical proficiency were higher in straight men than women. Gay men proved to be shifted in a female-typical direction compared to straight men for right-hand 2D:4D, left-hand 2D:4D, anxiety, and cognitive reflection; they were intermediate for dominance and mathematics, and were shifted in a male-typical direction for impulsivity. Lesbians were shifted in a male-typical direction compared to straight women for left-hand 2D:4D, anxiety, cognitive reflection, and mathematics; and they were shifted in a highly female-typical direction for impulsivity and dominance (scoring lower than straight women). Observed sex-linked shifts in gay men and lesbians were larger for psychological traits that displayed larger sex differences, and smallest for impulsivity (which displayed the smallest sex difference). Evidence also suggested that sex-related measures were linked to 2D:4D in theoretically meaningful ways. In conclusion, this report suggests a plausible role of androgens as prenatal determinants of sex-linked personality and cognitive traits in straight and non-straight men and women.","['2D:4D finger-length', 'Cognitive ability', 'Personality', 'Sexual orientation']",Archives of sexual behavior,2023-08-04,"[{'lastname': 'Aguilar', 'firstname': 'Raúl', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Psicología Básica, Facultad de Psicología y Logopedia, Universidad de Málaga, C/ Doctor Ortiz Ramos, 12, Ampliación de Teatinos, 29010, Málaga, Spain. raul.aguilar@uma.es.'}]",,,,"© 2023.

28,37499299,The influence of sex steroid treatment on insular connectivity in gender dysphoria.,"Sex-specific differences in brain connectivity were found in various neuroimaging studies, though little is known about sex steroid effects on insular functioning. Based on well-characterized sex differences in emotion regulation, interoception and higher-level cognition, gender-dysphoric individuals receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy represent an interesting cohort to investigate how sex hormones might influence insular connectivity and related brain functions.
To analyze the potential effect of sex steroids on insular connectivity at rest, 11 transgender women, 14 transgender men, 20 cisgender women, and 11 cisgender men were recruited. All participants underwent two magnetic resonance imaging sessions involving resting-state acquisitions separated by a median time period of 4.5 months and also completed the Bermond-Vorst alexithymia questionnaire at the initial and final examination. Between scans, transgender subjects received gender-affirming hormone therapy.
A seed based functional connectivity analysis revealed a significant 2-way interaction effect of group-by-time between right insula, cingulum, left middle frontal gyrus and left angular gyrus. Post-hoc tests demonstrated an increase in connectivity for transgender women when compared to cisgender men. Furthermore, spectral dynamic causal modelling showed reduced effective connectivity from the posterior cingulum and left angular gyrus to the left middle frontal gyrus as well as from the right insula to the left middle frontal gyrus. Alexithymia changes were found after gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender women in both fantasizing and identifying.
These findings suggest a considerable influence of estrogen administration and androgen suppression on brain networks implicated in interoception, own-body perception and higher-level cognition.","['Gender-affirming hormone therapy', 'Insula', 'Interoception', 'Resting-state', 'Transgender']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2023-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Reed', 'firstname': 'Murray B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Handschuh', 'firstname': 'Patricia A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Klöbl', 'firstname': 'Manfred', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Konadu', 'firstname': 'Melisande E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaufmann', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hahn', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kranz', 'firstname': 'Georg S', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Spies', 'firstname': 'Marie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanzenberger', 'firstname': 'Rupert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

34590590",Neurocognitive effects of androgen deprivation therapy and new hormonal agents in a sample of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.,"Although the growing treatment landscape for metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) has revealed new opportunities, it has also provided challenges, such as undesirable side effects. The aim of the present study was to provide further data on domain-specific cognitive impairments in mPC patients with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and new hormonal agents.
Fifty-eight patients (71 ± 8 years) with mPC were investigated using a cross-sectional design. All patients had received some form of ADT (93% had received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs/antagonists), 66% had received chemotherapy, and 84% had received anti-resorptive therapy. We evaluated learning and memory, processing speed, and executive functions, as recommended by the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force, to determine neurocognitive deficits.
Patients treated with ADT scored significantly lower on all neurocognitive tests and showed significantly more neurocognitive deficits (38-62%) than age-adjusted reference samples (16%, p < 0.05). Cognitive deficits were mild in most cases and predominantly affected visuomotor processing speed (48%). Moderate and severe deficits were found in 11% and 5% of patients, respectively, with word fluency as the predominant deficit (23%). No associations were found between the type or duration of treatment and the severity of cognitive deficits.
Treatment of mPC with ADT is correlated with neurocognitive deficits in several cognitive domains. Language skills and processing speed were most frequently impaired. However, a consistent pattern of cognitive impairment was not identified. Neurocognitive deficits should be considered in phase III and IV trials.
The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00017727).","['Androgen deprivation therapy', 'Hormonal agents', 'Metastatic prostate cancer', 'Neurocognitive effects']",International urology and nephrology,2023-07-19,"[{'lastname': 'Ihrig', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psycho-Oncology, Department of General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. andreas.ihrig@med.uni-heidelberg.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Pernt', 'firstname': 'Pascal Marino', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psycho-Oncology, Department of General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zschäbitz', 'firstname': 'Stefanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Centre for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Huber', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Philipps-University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Friederich', 'firstname': 'Hans-Christoph', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psycho-Oncology, Department of General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bugaj', 'firstname': 'Till J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psycho-Oncology, Department of General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Maatouk', 'firstname': 'Imad', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psycho-Oncology, Department of General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.\nSection of Psychosomatic Medicine, Psychotherapy and Psycho-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine II, Julius-Maximilian University Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.'}]",,,"Patients treated with ADT scored significantly lower on all neurocognitive tests and showed significantly more neurocognitive deficits (38-62%) than age-adjusted reference samples (16%, p < 0.05).

29766538","Pre-puberty cannabichromene exposure modulates reproductive function via alteration of spermatogenesis, steroidogenesis, and eNOS pathway metabolites.","Cannabis and cannabinoids affect almost every system of the body and exert systemic effects such as alterations in memory and cognitive functions, neurotransmission impediment, as well as obstruction of endocrine and reproductive system functions. Reproduction is a complicated phenomenon that integrates biological, psychological and behavioural aspects, hence susceptible to intracellular and extracellular modulations by numerous chemicals and toxicants like cannabis.
The effects of early-life exposure to cannabis on reproductive function biomarkers and genes were investigated in male and female Wistar rats in this study.
An initial computational analysis (molecular docking and induced fit docking) of some cannabinoids with reproductive enzymes; androgen and follicle stimulating hormone receptors was conducted. Overall, cannabichromene (CBC) had the best IFD scores and binding free energies for the two proteins studied and it interacted with notable amino acids within their active sites. Subsequently, forty (40) Wistar rats, 20 male and 20 female (24-28 days old, weighing 20-28 ± 2 g) were divided into two groups each and orally administered CBC for 21 days. Penile tissues, testes and ovaries, were collected for biochemical analysis (hormonal assays, enzyme activities, and metabolite concentrations), gene expressions, and histological evaluations.
Activities of arginase and phosphodiesterase-5 in the penile tissue were significantly increased, while nitric oxide and calcium levels were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the CBC-exposed groups relative to the control group. Semen analysis showed significantly more abnormalities and decreased concentration of spermatozoa in the CBC-exposed group compared to the control. Activities of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and cholesterol level were decreased in both testes and ovaries of CBC-exposed groups. Furthermore, levels of testosterone, progesterone, luteinizing, and follicle-stimulating hormones were reduced in the serum of CBC rats. Moreover, relative expressions of androgen receptor and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor genes were significantly downregulated in the CBC-exposed groups. Histological evaluations revealed lesions, tubular necrosis, and cellular congestions in both the testes and ovaries.
This study suggests that pre-puberty exposure to cannabis modulates reproductive functions via cannabichromene inhibition of steroidogenesis, stimulation of erectile dysfunction (modulation of intermediates and enzymes of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway in the penile tissue), and downregulation of the expressions of genes associated with reproduction.","['Cannabichromene', 'Cannabis', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Reproduction', 'Steroidogenesis']",Toxicology reports,2023-07-03,"[{'lastname': 'Taiwo', 'firstname': 'Odunayo Anthonia', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural and Applied Sciences, Chrisland University, Ajebo Abeokuta, Ogun-state, Nigeria.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, College of Biosciences, Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Dosumu', 'firstname': 'Oluwatosin Adebisi', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Biosciences, Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'James', 'firstname': 'Adewale Segun', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Science, Department of Chemical Sciences (Biochemistry Programme), Augustine University, Ilara-Epe, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Ugwor', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel Ifeanyichukwu', 'initials': 'EI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Biosciences, Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Ojo', 'firstname': 'Oluwafemi Adeleke', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Phytomedicine, Molecular Toxicology, and Computational Biochemistry Research Laboratory (PMTCB-RL) Department of Biochemistry, Bowen University, 232101 Iwo, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Dedeke', 'firstname': 'Gabriel Adewunmi', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pure and Applied Zoology, College of Biosciences, Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Ademuyiwa', 'firstname': 'Oladipo', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Biosciences, Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria.'}]","An initial computational analysis (molecular docking and induced fit docking) of some cannabinoids with reproductive enzymes; androgen and follicle stimulating hormone receptors was conducted.

31,37390781,Hormonal responses to mating competition in male Tonkean macaques.,"Glucocorticoid and androgen hormones play a prominent role in male reproductive effort. Their production usually increases in non-human primates during mating competition, which may include rivalry for access to receptive females, struggles for high dominance rank, or social pressure on low-ranking individuals. It is generally assumed that glucocorticoids and androgens are associated with mating challenges rather than dominance status, but the involvement of multiple factors makes it difficult to disentangle the two. In this regard, Tonkean macaques provide a suitable model because they are characterized by relaxed dominance and year-round breeding, meaning that there is typically no more than one receptive female in a group, and thus first-ranking males can easily monopolize her. We studied two captive groups of Tonkean macaques over an 80-month period, recording the reproductive status of females, collecting urine from males and sampling behaviors in both sexes. Male urinary hormone concentrations could be affected by increased competition caused by the mating period, the number of males and the degree of female attractiveness. The highest increases in androgens were recorded in males performing female mate-guarding. Despite the importance of dominance status in determining which males can mate, we found no significant effect of male rank on glucocorticoids and only a marginal effect on androgens during mate-guarding. Both types of hormones were more directly involved in the mating effort of males than in their dominance status. Our results show that their function can be understood in light of the particular competitive needs generated by the species-specific social system.","['Androgens', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hierarchical steepness', 'Intermale competition', 'Mate-guarding', 'Primate', 'Reproductive effort', 'Social style', 'Tolerance']",Hormones and behavior,2023-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Thierry', 'firstname': 'Bernard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive, CNRS, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.

32,37357294,Reproductive Markers in Alzheimer's Disease Progression: The Framingham Heart Study.,"Reproductive status, such as the age of menarche or menopause, may be linked to cognitive abilities and risk for incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the evidence is conflicting. It is also not fully known if these factors interact with cortical beta-amyloid deposition.
To study the relationship between reproductive risks, sex hormone markers and risk for decline in specific cognitive domains in women.
We analyzed the association of reproductive markers (age at menarche, number of births, age at menopause, sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol, estrone, total testosterone, free testosterone) with incident AD and annualized cognitive decline in the community-based longitudinal Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring women 60 years and older (n=772, mean age 68 years, mean follow-up 10.7 ± 3 years). We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model and linear regression model, adjusting for covariates.
Incident AD dementia as well as the annualized change in memory, language, attention and executive functions.
Older age at menopause was associated with a lower risk of incident AD dementia (p = 0.047, 6% lower risk per older year) after adjusting for baseline age, education, hormone therapy status, and MMSE score. Older age at menopause was significantly associated with a slower annualized decline in memory (beta = 0.085, p = 0.00059). The lower level of plasma Aβ42 was also associated with a higher risk of incident AD (HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95, 0.99; p = 0.0039) but there was no significant interaction effect with age at menarche, age at menopause or plasma sex hormone levels.
Younger age at menopause is a risk factor for late-life memory decline and incident AD. This risk appears to be independent of Aβ42 pathology. Further studies to understand the biological and social mechanisms underlying the differential effects of reproductive risks are warranted.","['Reproductive risks of women', 'cognitive function', 'incident Alzheimer’s disease']",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2023-06-26,"[{'lastname': 'Ding', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Huitong Ding, Chunyu Liu, Crosstown Building 801, Massachusetts Avenue Boston, MA 02118, USA, dinghfut@bu.edu, liuc@bu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ang', 'firstname': 'T F A', 'initials': 'TFA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Devine', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Au', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Doraiswamy', 'firstname': 'P M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}]",,Younger age at menopause is a risk factor for late-life memory decline and incident AD.

33,37356425,Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Hippocampal Development: The Role of Estrogen and Androgen Signaling.,"Hormones are important regulators of key processes during fetal brain development. Thus, the developing brain is vulnerable to the action of chemicals that can interfere with endocrine signals. Epidemiological studies have pointed toward sexually dimorphic associations between neurodevelopmental outcomes, such as cognitive abilities, in children and prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). This points toward disruption of sex steroid signaling in the development of neural structures underlying cognitive functions, such as the hippocampus, an essential mediator of learning and memory processes. Indeed, during development, the hippocampus is subjected to the organizational effects of estrogens and androgens, which influence hippocampal cell proliferation, differentiation, dendritic growth, and synaptogenesis in the hippocampal fields of Cornu Ammonis and the dentate gyrus. These early organizational effects correlate with a sexual dimorphism in spatial cognition and are subject to exogenous chemical perturbations. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the organizational effects of estrogens and androgens on the developing hippocampus and the evidence for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory perturbations induced by developmental exposure to EDCs. We conclude that, while it is clear that sex hormone signaling plays a significant role during hippocampal development, a complete picture at the molecular and cellular levels would be needed to establish causative links between the endocrine modes of action exerted by EDCs and the adverse outcomes these chemicals can induce at the organism level.","['Androgen signaling', 'Development', 'Endocrine-disrupting chemicals', 'Estrogen signaling', 'Hippocampus']",Neuroendocrinology,2023-06-26,"[{'lastname': 'Lupu', 'firstname': 'Diana-Ioana', 'initials': 'DI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Cediel Ulloa', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Rüegg', 'firstname': 'Joëlle', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}]",,,,"© 2023 The Author(s).

34,37350593,A national questionnaire survey of Japanese urologists on treatment perspectives for elderly prostate cancer patients.,"This study conducted a national questionnaire survey of Japanese urologists from a treatment perspective for older patients with prostate cancer.
A questionnaire was distributed to 922 teaching hospitals of the Japanese Urological Association. Questionnaire items included years of urologist experience, gender, workplace, treatment equipment owned, daily specialty practice area, urological cancer specialty, treatment reference items for older adults, upper age limit for radical treatment, medication, and two hypothetical cases of Gleason grade group 2 prostate cancer with or without oligometastasis.
In total, 1732 questionnaires were analyzed, with responses evenly distributed across all age groups. Workplaces included general hospitals (49.4%), university hospitals (40.3%), and cancer centers (4.2%). Performance status was the most frequently mentioned treatment-related item, followed by comorbidities and cognitive function. In addition, geriatric assessment was used by only 13.3% of respondents. No upper age limit was found for total prostatectomy, brachytherapy, and external beam radiation. Anti-androgens, androgen receptor-axis-targeted agents, chemotherapy, poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, and immune-checkpoint inhibitors were selected by 6.8%, 35.6%, 47.3%, 89%, 62.8%, 24.7%, 41.9%, and 41.7% of the respondents, respectively. Response rates for administration of hormone therapy for hypothetical cases of Gleason grade group 2 prostate cancer with or without oligometastases were 96.8% and 61.2%, respectively.
Less than 15% of urologists used geriatric assessments. Several responded that they would set age limits for highly invasive radical and systemic therapies.","['elderly patients', 'prostate cancer', 'questionnaire survey', 'treatment perspective', 'urologists']",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,2023-06-23,"[{'lastname': 'Kato', 'firstname': 'Takuma', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tohi', 'firstname': 'Yoichiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Honda', 'firstname': 'Tomoko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsuda', 'firstname': 'Iori', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Osaki', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Naito', 'firstname': 'Hirohito', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsuoka', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okazoe', 'firstname': 'Homare', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Taoka', 'firstname': 'Rikiya', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ueda', 'firstname': 'Nobufumi', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sugimoto', 'firstname': 'Mikio', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.'}]",,,"In total, 1732 questionnaires were analyzed, with responses evenly distributed across all age groups.

35,37341037,Developmental shift in testosterone influence on prefrontal emotion control.,"A paradox of testosterone effects is seen in adolescents versus adults in social emotional approach-avoidance behavior. During adolescence, high testosterone levels are associated with increased anterior prefrontal (aPFC) involvement in emotion control, whereas during adulthood this neuro-endocrine relation is reversed. Rodent work shows that, during puberty, testosterone transitions from a neuro-developmental to a social-sexual activating hormone. In this study, we explored whether this functional transition is also present in human adolescents and young adults. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we investigated the role of testosterone on neural control of social emotional behavior during the transitions from middle to late adolescence and into young adulthood. Seventy-one individuals (tested at ages 14, 17, and 20 years) performed an fMRI-adapted approach-avoidance (AA) task involving automatic and controlled actions in response to social emotional stimuli. In line with predictions from animal models, the effect of testosterone on aPFC engagement decreased between middle and late adolescence, and shifted into an activational role by young adulthood-impeding neural control of emotions. This change in testosterone function was accompanied by increased testosterone-modulated amygdala reactivity. These findings qualify the testosterone-dependent maturation of the prefrontal-amygdala circuit supporting emotion control during the transition from middle adolescence into young adulthood.","['adulthood', 'approach-avoidance', 'frontal pole', 'puberty', 'social emotional control', 'testosterone']",Developmental science,2023-06-21,"[{'lastname': 'Tyborowska', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.\nDonders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Volman', 'firstname': 'Inge', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.\nWellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (WIN), Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Niermann', 'firstname': 'Hannah C M', 'initials': 'HCM', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.\nDonders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Dapprich', 'firstname': 'Anna L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Smeekens', 'firstname': 'Sanny', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.\nFaculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Open University of the Netherlands, Heerlen, Netherlands.\nPro Persona, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Cillessen', 'firstname': 'Antonius H N', 'initials': 'AHN', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Toni', 'firstname': 'Ivan', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Roelofs', 'firstname': 'Karin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.\nDonders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}]",,,,© 2023 The Authors.

36,37329313,A role for GnRH in olfaction and cognition: Implications for veterinary medicine.,"Pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential for the activation and maintenance of the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which controls the onset of puberty and fertility. Two provocative recent studies suggest that, in addition to control reproduction, the neurons in the brain that produce GnRH are also involved in the control postnatal brain maturation, odour discrimination and adult cognition. Long-acting GnRH antagonists and agonists are commonly used to control fertility and behaviour in veterinary medicine, primarily in males. This review puts into perspective the potential risks of these androgen deprivation therapies and immunization on olfactory and cognitive performances and well-aging in domestic animals, including pets. We will also discuss the results reporting beneficial effects of pharmacological interventions restoring physiological GnRH levels on olfactory and cognitive alterations in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease, which shares many pathophysiological and behavioural hallmarks with canine cognitive dysfunction. These novel findings raise the intriguing possibility that pulsatile GnRH therapy holds therapeutic potential for the management of this behavioural syndrome affecting older dogs.","['brain', 'hypothalamus', 'learning', 'neurodevelopmental diseases', 'reproduction', 'smell', 'well-aging']",Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,2023-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Prévot', 'firstname': 'Vincent', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Univ.

37,37307791,Effects of 24-hour oral estradiol-valerate administration on hormone levels in men and pre-menopausal women.,"In order to translate the findings from the vast animal literature on the effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) on brain and behavior to humans, a placebo-controlled pharmacological enhancement of E2 levels for at least 24 h is necessary. However, an exogenous increase in E2 for such a prolonged period might affect the endogenous secretion of other (neuroactive) hormones. Such effects would be of relevance for the interpretation of the effects of this pharmacological regimen on cognition and its neural correlates as well as be of basic scientific interest. We therefore administered a double dose of 12 mg of estradiol-valerate (E2V) to men and of 8 mg to naturally cycling women in their low-hormone phase, and assessed the concentration of two steroids critical to hormone regulation: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). We also assessed any changes in concentration of the neuroactive hormones progesterone (P4), testosterone (TST), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and immune-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This regimen resulted in similar E2 levels in both sexes (saliva and serum). FSH and LH levels in both sexes were down-regulated to the same degree. P4 concentration decreased in both sexes only in serum but not saliva. TST and DHT levels dropped only in men whereas sex-hormone binding globulin was not affected. Finally, the concentration of IGF-1 decreased in both sexes. Based on previous studies on the effects of these neuroactive hormones, only the degree of downregulation of TST and DHT levels in men might have an impact on brain and behavior, which should be considered when interpreting the effects of the presented E2V regimes.","['Estrogen', 'Follicle stimulating hormone', 'Insulin-like growth factor 1', 'Luteinizing hormone', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2023-06-12,"[{'lastname': 'Rune', 'firstname': 'Gabriele M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Cell Biology and Neurobiology, Charité Anatomy, Charitéplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Joue', 'firstname': 'Gina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistr. 52, D-20248 Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sommer', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistr. 52, D-20248 Hamburg, Germany.

18640147",Parental experience is linked with lower vasopressin receptor 1a binding and decreased postpartum androgens in titi monkeys.,"Parenting induces many neurological and behavioral changes that enable parents to rear offspring. Vasopressin plays an important role in this process via its effects on cognition, affect, and neuroplasticity, and in some cases, via interactions with decreased parental androgens. Thus far, the role of these hormones has been primarily studied in rodents. To address this gap, we explored vasopressin receptors and androgens in titi monkeys, a pair-bonding and biparental primate species. In Studies 1 and 2, we used receptor autoradiography to correlate arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) binding in the hippocampus (Study 1, n = 10) and the rest of the forebrain (Study 2, n = 23) with parental status, parental experience, parity, infant carrying, and pair affiliation. We found that parents exhibited lower AVPR1a binding than non-parents throughout most brain regions assessed, with especially strong effects in the hippocampus (β = -.61), superior colliculus (β = -.88), lateral septum (β = -.35), and medial preoptic area (β = -.29). The other measures of parental experience also tended to be negatively associated with AVPR1a binding across different brain regions. In Study 3 (n = 44), we compared pre- and postpartum urinary androgen levels in parents and non-parents and found that mothers exhibited a sustained androgen decrease across 3-4 months postpartum (relative to 3 months prepartum; β ranged from -.72 to -.62 for different comparisons). For males, we found that multiparous fathers exhibited decreased androgen levels at 1-2 weeks postpartum (β = -.25) and at 3-4 months postpartum (β = -.40) compared to the prepartum, indicating both immediate and long-term reductions with subsequent paternal experience. Together, the results of this study suggest that decreases in AVPR1a binding and circulating androgens are associated with parental behavior and physiology in titi monkeys.","['AVPR1a binding', 'infant care', 'pair bonding', 'parental androgen suppression', 'parental brain']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2023-06-02,"[{'lastname': 'Baxter', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.\nCalifornia National Primate Research Center, Davis, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Karaskiewicz', 'firstname': 'Chloe L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.\nCalifornia National Primate Research Center, Davis, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Lindsey A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'California National Primate Research Center, Davis, California, USA.\nDepartment of Animal Biology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kinnally', 'firstname': 'Erin L', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.\nCalifornia National Primate Research Center, Davis, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferrer', 'firstname': 'Emilio', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Seelke', 'firstname': 'Adele H M', 'initials': 'AHM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.\nCalifornia National Primate Research Center, Davis, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Freeman', 'firstname': 'Sara M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'California National Primate Research Center, Davis, California, USA.\nDepartment of Biology, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bales', 'firstname': 'Karen L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.\nCalifornia National Primate Research Center, Davis, California, USA.\nDepartment of Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.'}]",,,,© 2023 The Authors.

31567463",Association of Second-generation Antiandrogens With Cognitive and Functional Toxic Effects in Randomized Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The use of second-generation antiandrogens (AAs) in the treatment of prostate cancer is increasing. Retrospective evidence suggests an association between second-generation AAs and adverse cognitive and functional outcomes, but further data from prospective trials are needed.
To examine whether evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in prostate cancer supports an association between second-generation AAs and cognitive or functional toxic effects.
PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus (inception to September 12, 2022).
Randomized clinical trials of second-generation AAs (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide) among individuals with prostate cancer that reported cognitive toxic effects, asthenic toxic effects (eg, fatigue, weakness), or falls were evaluated.
Study screening, data abstraction, and bias assessment were completed independently by 2 reviewers following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research reporting guidelines. Tabular counts for all-grade toxic effects were determined to test the hypothesis formulated before data collection.
Risk ratios (RRs) and SEs were calculated for cognitive toxic effects, asthenic toxic effects, and falls. Because fatigue was the asthenic toxic effect extracted from all studies, data on fatigue are specified in the results. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to generate summary statistics.
The systematic review included 12 studies comprising 13 524 participants. Included studies had a low risk of bias. An increased risk of cognitive toxic effects (RR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.30-3.38; P = .002) and fatigue (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.54; P < .001) was noted among individuals treated with second-generation AAs vs those in the control arms. The findings were consistent in studies that included traditional hormone therapy in both treatment arms for cognitive toxic effects (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12-2.79; P = .01) and fatigue (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58; P = .003). Meta-regression supported that, across studies, increased age was associated with a greater risk of fatigue with second-generation AAs (coefficient, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.04-0.12; P < .001). In addition, the use of second-generation AAs was associated with an increased risk of falls (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.27-2.75; P = .001).
The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that second-generation AAs carry an increased risk of cognitive and functional toxic effects, including when added to traditional forms of hormone therapy.",[],JAMA oncology,2023-05-25,"[{'lastname': 'Nowakowska', 'firstname': 'Malgorzata K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Ortega', 'firstname': 'Rachel M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Wehner', 'firstname': 'Mackenzie R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.\nDepartment of Health Services Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.'}, {'lastname': 'Nead', 'firstname': 'Kevin T', 'initials': 'KT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.'}]",,,"The systematic review included 12 studies comprising 13 524 participants.

40,37210755,"Hormonal contraception & face processing: Examining face gender, androgenicity & treatment duration.","Previous cross-sectional studies observed differences between users and non-users of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in both the structure and function of the fusiform face area (FFA) related to face processing. For the present study 120 female participants performed high-resolution structural, as well as functional scans at rest, during face encoding and face recognition. Participants were either never-users of COCs (26), current first-time users of androgenic (29) or anti-androgenic COCs (23) or previous users of androgenic (21) or anti-androgenic COCs (21). Results suggest that associations between COC-use and face processing are modulated by androgenicity, but do not persist beyond the duration of COC use. The majority of findings concern the connectivity of the left FFA to the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which is a key region in cognitive empathy. While connectivity in anti-androgenic COC users differs from never users irrespective of the duration of COC use already at rest, connectivity in androgenic COC users decreases with longer duration of use during face recognition. Furthermore, longer duration of androgenic COC use was related to reduced identification accuracy, as well as increased connectivity of the left FFA to the right orbitofrontal cortex. Accordingly, the FFA and SMG emerge as promising ROIs for future randomized controlled trials on the effects of COC use on face processing.","['Combined oral contraceptives', 'Face recognition', 'Functional connectivity', 'Fusiform face area', 'Supramarginal gyrus']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2023-05-21,"[{'lastname': 'Pletzer', 'firstname': 'Belinda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology & Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience Paris-Lodron-University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.

17869382","Comparison of Cerebral Blood Flow in Regions Relevant to Cognition After Enzalutamide, Darolutamide, and Placebo in Healthy Volunteers: A Randomized Crossover Trial.","Off-target central nervous system (CNS) effects are associated with androgen receptor (AR)-targeting treatments for prostate cancer. Darolutamide is a structurally distinct AR inhibitor with low blood-brain barrier penetration.
We compared cerebral blood flow (CBF) in grey matter and specific regions related to cognition after darolutamide, enzalutamide, or placebo administration, using arterial spin-label magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI).
This phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover study administered single doses of darolutamide, enzalutamide, or placebo to 23 healthy males (aged 18-45 years) at 6-week intervals. ASL-MRI mapped CBF 4 h post-treatment. Treatments were compared using paired t-tests.
Drug concentrations during scans confirmed similar unbound exposure of darolutamide and enzalutamide, with complete washout between treatments. A significant localized 5.2% (p = 0.01) and 5.9% (p < 0.001) CBF reduction in the temporo-occipital cortices was observed for enzalutamide versus placebo and versus darolutamide, respectively, with no significant differences for darolutamide versus placebo. Enzalutamide reduced CBF in all prespecified regions, with significant reductions versus placebo (3.9%, p = 0.045) and versus darolutamide (4.4%, p = 0.037) in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, respectively. Darolutamide showed minimal changes in CBF versus placebo in cognition-relevant regions.
Darolutamide did not significantly alter CBF, consistent with its low blood-brain barrier penetration and low risk of CNS-related adverse events. A significant reduction in CBF was observed with enzalutamide. These results may be relevant to cognitive function with early and extended use of second-generation AR inhibitors, and warrant further investigation in patients with prostate cancer.
NCT03704519; date of registration: October 2018.
Androgens, or male sex hormones, bind to androgen receptors within prostate cells and can cause growth of prostate cancer. The treatment of prostate cancer often includes drugs that bind to androgen receptors, called androgen receptor inhibitors, keeping androgens from binding to the receptors and preventing prostate cancer growth. In clinical studies, these drugs may have adverse effects on the central nervous system, or brain, including dizziness, falls, and impaired thinking and problem solving. This study compared the effects of two androgen receptor inhibitors, darolutamide and enzalutamide, and placebo on blood flow in the brain. Blood flow was measured by a type of magnetic resonance imaging in healthy men after receiving a single dose of treatment. Blood flow in the brain was reduced by enzalutamide compared with both placebo and darolutamide. Darolutamide did not decrease brain blood flow. This lack of effect on brain blood flow is in line with preclinical studies that showed darolutamide’s limited ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, which is the naturally occurring barrier that protects the brain from harmful substances. In clinical studies of patients with prostate cancer treated with darolutamide, adverse effects on the brain have occurred in similar proportions of patients receiving darolutamide and placebo. In contrast, enzalutamide treatment has an increased risk of adverse effects on the brain versus placebo. The results of this study provide information on the effects of these androgen receptor inhibitors on brain blood flow that may be related to their adverse effects on the brain and its functioning.",[],Targeted oncology,2023-04-27,"[{'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Steven C R', 'initials': 'SCR', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AF, UK. steve.williams@kcl.ac.uk.""}, {'lastname': 'Mazibuko', 'firstname': 'Ndaba', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AF, UK.""}, {'lastname': ""O'Daly"", 'firstname': 'Owen', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AF, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Zurth', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacology Oncology, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Patrick', 'firstname': 'Fiona', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AF, UK.\nOxford Institute of Clinical Psychology Training and Research, The Oxford Centre for Psychological Health, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust and University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Kappeler', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Development, Oncology, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuss', 'firstname': 'Iris', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Development, Oncology, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Cole', 'firstname': 'Patricia E', 'initials': 'PE', 'affiliation': 'Imaging Strategy Oncology, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA.'}]",,,"Drug concentrations during scans confirmed similar unbound exposure of darolutamide and enzalutamide, with complete washout between treatments.

42,37085118,"Evaluations of memory, anxiety, and the growth factor IGF-1R after post-surgical menopause treatment with a highly selective progestin.","Progestogens are a key component of menopausal hormone therapies. While some progestogens can be detrimental to cognition, there is preclinical evidence that progestogens with a strong progesterone-receptor affinity benefit some molecular mechanisms believed to underlie cognitive function. Thus, a progestin that maximizes progesterone-receptor affinity and minimizes affinities to other receptors may be cognitively beneficial. We evaluated segesterone-acetate (SGA), a 19-norprogesterone derivative with a strong progesterone-receptor affinity and no androgenic or estrogenic-receptor activity, hypothesizing that it would enhance cognition. Middle-aged rats underwent Sham or Ovariectomy (Ovx) surgery followed by administration of medroxyprogesterone-acetate (MPA; used as a positive control as we have previously shown MPA-induced cognitive deficits), SGA (low or high dose), or vehicle (one Sham and one Ovx group). Spatial working and reference memory, delayed retention, and anxiety-like behavior were assessed, as were memory- and hormone- related protein assays within the frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. Low-dose SGA impaired spatial working memory, while high-dose SGA had a more extensive detrimental impact, negatively affecting spatial reference memory and delayed retention. Replicating previous findings, MPA impaired spatial reference memory and delayed retention. SGA, but not MPA, alleviated Ovx-induced anxiety-like behaviors. On two working memory measures, IGF-1R expression correlated with better working memory only in rats without hormone manipulation; any hormone manipulation or combination of hormone manipulations used herein altered this relationship. These findings suggest that SGA impairs spatial cognition after surgical menopause, and that surgical menopause with or without progestin administration disrupts relationships between a growth factor critical to neuroplasticity.","['Learning', 'Memory', 'Ovariectomy', 'Progestin', 'Rat', 'WRAM']",Behavioural brain research,2023-04-22,"[{'lastname': 'Bernaud', 'firstname': 'Victoria E', 'initials': 'VE', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, 950 S.

43,37080448,The Role of Androgens and Estrogens in Social Interactions and Social Cognition.,"Gonadal hormones are becoming increasingly recognized for their effects on cognition. Estrogens, in particular, have received attention for their effects on learning and memory that rely upon the functioning of various brain regions. However, the impacts of androgens on cognition are relatively under investigated. Testosterone, as well as estrogens, have been shown to play a role in the modulation of different aspects of social cognition. This review explores the impact of testosterone and other androgens on various facets of social cognition including social recognition, social learning, social approach/avoidance, and aggression. We highlight the relevance of considering not only the actions of the most commonly studied steroids (i.e., testosterone, 17β-estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone), but also that of their metabolites and precursors, which interact with a plethora of different receptors and signalling molecules, ultimately modulating behaviour. We point out that it is also essential to investigate the effects of androgens, their precursors and metabolites in females, as prior studies have mostly focused on males. Overall, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of steroids such as androgens on behaviour is fundamental for a full understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition, including that of humans.","['aggression', 'androgens', 'estrogens', 'social behavior', 'social learning', 'social recognition']",Neuroscience,2023-04-21,"[{'lastname': 'Aspesi', 'firstname': 'Dario', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bass', 'firstname': 'Noah', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kavaliers', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Canada; Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada; Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Choleris', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Canada.

44,37061875,"The behavioral profile of 49,XXXXY and the potential impact of testosterone replacement therapy.","49,XXXXY (1:85,000-100,000) is a rare sex chromosome aneuploidy that often presents with complex musculoskeletal abnormalities, decreased cognitive capabilities, speech and language dysfunction, and behavioral complications. Hormonal replacement therapy, or testosterone replacement therapy, is associated with improved neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in males with 49,XXXXY. Two forms of testosterone replacement therapy, early hormonal treatment (EHT) and hormonal booster therapy (HBT), are associated with improved neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in these boys. This study investigates the impact of EHT and HBT on behavioral symptoms in males with 49,XXXXY.
A total of 59 individuals were divided into 4 groups: 19 no testosterone (no-T), 23 EHT, 6 HBT, and 11 EHT and HBT. An analysis of variance examined group differences on the Child Behavior Checklist and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function ranging from 5 to 18 years.
Although no differences were identified on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, the 3 hormonal replacement therapy groups presented with decreased complications on numerous variables on the Child Behavior Checklist; these include somatic complaints (P = .0095), somatic problems (P = .041), internalizing problems (P = .034), externalizing problems (P = .0001), and withdrawn/depression (P = .025).

4120573",The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis in Men with Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a chronic, progressive course. The etiology of this condition is linked to the interactions of multiple genes and environmental factors. The earlier age of onset of schizophrenia, the higher frequency of negative symptoms in the clinical presentation, and the poorer response to antipsychotic treatment in men compared to women suggests the involvement of sex hormones in these processes. This article aims to draw attention to the possible relationship between testosterone and some clinical features in male schizophrenic patients and discuss the complex nature of these phenomena based on data from the literature. PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched to select the papers without limiting the time of the publications. Hormone levels in the body are regulated by many organs and systems, and take place through the neuroendocrine, hormonal, neural, and metabolic pathways. Sex hormones play an important role in the development and function of the organism. Besides their impact on secondary sex characteristics, they influence brain development and function, mood, and cognition. In men with schizophrenia, altered testosterone levels were noted. In many cases, evidence from available single studies gave contradictory results. However, it seems that the testosterone level in men affected by schizophrenia may differ depending on the phase of the disease, types of clinical symptoms, and administered therapy. The etiology of testosterone level disturbances may be very complex. Besides the impact of the illness (schizophrenia), stress, and antipsychotic drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, testosterone levels may be influenced by, i.a., obesity, substances of abuse (e.g., ethanol), or liver damage.","['HPG axis', 'estradiol', 'hyperprolactinemia', 'hypogonadism', 'male', 'prolactin', 'psychotropic drugs', 'schizophrenia', 'sex hormones', 'testosterone']",International journal of molecular sciences,2023-04-14,"[{'lastname': 'Matuszewska', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Wroclaw Medical University, J.

30068962",Testosterone eliminates strategic prosocial behavior through impacting choice consistency in healthy males.,"Humans are strategically more prosocial when their actions are being watched by others than when they act alone. Using a psychopharmacogenetic approach, we investigated the endocrinological and computational mechanisms of such audience-driven prosociality. One hundred and ninety-two male participants received either a single dose of testosterone (150 mg) or a placebo and performed a prosocial and self-benefitting reinforcement learning task. Crucially, the task was performed either in private or when being watched. Rival theories suggest that the hormone might either diminish or strengthen audience-dependent prosociality. We show that exogenous testosterone fully eliminated strategic, i.e., feigned, prosociality and thus decreased submission to audience expectations. We next performed reinforcement-learning drift-diffusion computational modeling to elucidate which latent aspects of decision-making testosterone acted on. The modeling revealed that testosterone compared to placebo did not deteriorate reinforcement learning per se. Rather, when being watched, the hormone altered the degree to which the learned information on choice value translated to action selection. Taken together, our study provides novel evidence of testosterone's effects on implicit reward processing, through which it counteracts conformity and deceptive reputation strategies.",[],Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2023-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Kutlikova', 'firstname': 'Hana H', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognition, Emotion, and Methods in Psychology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. hana.kutlikova@univie.ac.at.\nDepartment of Experimental Psychology, Helmholtz Institute, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands. hana.kutlikova@univie.ac.at.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognition, Emotion, and Methods in Psychology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentre for Human Brain Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.\nInstitute for Mental Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Eisenegger', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognition, Emotion, and Methods in Psychology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'van Honk', 'firstname': 'Jack', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Psychology, Helmholtz Institute, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Lamm', 'firstname': 'Claus', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognition, Emotion, and Methods in Psychology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nVienna Cognitive Science Hub, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}]",,,,© 2023.

47,37001242,Neural Control of Sexually Dimorphic Social Behavior: Connecting Development to Adulthood.,"Rapid advances in the neural control of social behavior highlight the role of interconnected nodes engaged in differential information processing to generate behavior. Many innate social behaviors are essential to reproductive fitness and therefore fundamentally different in males and females. Programming these differences occurs early in development in mammals, following gonadal differentiation and copious androgen production by the fetal testis during a critical period. Early-life programming of social behavior and its adult manifestation are separate but yoked processes, yet how they are linked is unknown. This review seeks to highlight that gap by identifying four core mechanisms (epigenetics, cell death, circuit formation, and adult hormonal modulation) that could connect developmental changes to the adult behaviors of mating and aggression. We further propose that a unique social behavior, adolescent play, bridges the preweaning to the postpubertal brain by engaging the same neural networks underpinning adult reproductive and aggressive behaviors.","['GABA neurons', 'aggression', 'aromatase', 'epigenetics', 'social behavior network', 'social play']",Annual review of neuroscience,2023-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'McCarthy', 'firstname': 'Margaret M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Program in Neuroscience, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; email:\xa0mmccarthy@som.umaryland.edu.'}]",,,,,10.1146/annurev-neuro-121522-110856,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dc1e9d10>,,,,,,

26931629",Fronto-amygdala resting state functional connectivity is associated with anxiety symptoms among adolescent girls more advanced in pubertal maturation.,"Early adolescence, with the onset of puberty, is an important period when sex differences in anxiety emerge, with girls reporting significantly higher anxiety symptoms than boys. This study examined the role of puberty on fronto-amygdala functional connectivity and risk of anxiety symptoms in 70 girls (age 11-13) who completed a resting state fMRI scan, self-report measures of anxiety symptoms and pubertal status, and provided basal testosterone levels (64 girls). Resting state fMRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep and connectivity indices were extracted from ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala regions-of-interest. We tested moderated mediation models and hypothesized that vmPFC-amygdala would mediate the relation between three indices of puberty (testosterone and adrenarcheal/gonadarcheal development) and anxiety, with puberty moderating the relation between connectivity and anxiety. Results showed a significant moderation effect of testosterone and adrenarcheal development in the right amygdala and a rostral/dorsal area of the vmPFC and of gonadarcheal development in the left amygdala and a medial area of the vmPFC on anxiety symptoms. Simple slope analyses showed that vmPFC-amygdala connectivity was negatively associated with anxiety only in girls more advanced in puberty suggesting that sensitivity to the effects of puberty on fronto-amygdala function could contribute to risk for anxiety disorders among adolescent girls.","['Anxiety symptoms', 'FMRI', 'Puberty', 'Resting state functional connectivity', 'Testosterone']",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2023-03-31,"[{'lastname': 'Ladouceur', 'firstname': 'Cecile D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, USA; Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, USA; Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, USA.

23809625",Changes in circulating forms of anti-Muüllerian hormone and androgens in women with and without PCOS: a systematic longitudinal study throughout pregnancy.,"What are the changes in serum concentration of total and cleaved anti-Muüllerian hormone (AMH) molecular forms and of androgens before and throughout pregnancy in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a longitudinal follow-up investigation?
Serum levels of total and cleaved AMH are higher from preconception to the third trimester of pregnancy in women with PCOS as compared to controls, whereas testosterone and androstenedione levels are higher in women with PCOS than in control women before pregnancy and during the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
Cross-sectional or partial longitudinal studies have shown higher AMH and androgen levels in pregnant women with PCOS as compared with non-PCOS women. To date, no complete longitudinal dynamic monitoring of the circulating forms of AMH and androgens from pre-conception to the third trimester of pregnancy have compared women with and without PCOS.
This systematic prospective quarterly longitudinal monocentric study was a comparative follow-up of 30 women with PCOS and 29 controls before and during pregnancy from April 2019 to July 2022.
Women aged 18-43 years with a pre-conception measurement of AMH were included during the first trimester of a singleton pregnancy. The PCOS group was defined according to the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. The control group patients included in the study had normal ovarian reserves. Circulating total and cleaved AMH, and serum estradiol, LH, and androgen levels were measured during the first, second, and third trimester of pregnancy in all study participants.
Before pregnancy, patients with PCOS had higher levels of AMH than controls. The total and cleaved AMH forms were significantly higher in women with PCOS than controls from pre-conception to the third trimester of pregnancy (all P < 0.001). Androgens (total testosterone and androstenedione) were higher in women with PCOS than controls from mid-pregnancy onwards.
Our control population was a population of infertile women with no ovarian problems but most of them had undergone ART treatments to achieve pregnancy.
These results strengthen the hypothesis that gestational hyperandrogenism as well as exposure to elevated AMH levels in utero could be driving forces predisposing female progeny to develop PCOS.

26002789",[Cognitive and psychoemotional changes in menopausal transition: The possibility of medical correction].,"The increasing of older age group in the population determines studying of age related diseases and emergence of new investigations in this area. In Female body, entering the menopausal transition is the start of «aging» of reproductive function and linked with decreasing of sex hormons levels. A direct connection between changes of estrogen, progesterone, androgen ratios and cognitive function of women was revealed. The anatomical localization of sex hormone receptors, the mechanisms of interaction of hormones with these receptors determine the ways of implementing biological effects of steroids on the CNS. Modern theories of «healthy nerve cells» and «eu-estrogenemia» explains the role of additional criteria, such as the absence of neurological diseases history and the duration of hypoestrogenia, to the outcome of menopausal hormone therapy. Additional factors that can affect to MHT action include: the composition of hormone therapy, administration methods, regimens (cyclic, continuous), duration of treatment, history of endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, gynecological history (parity, menarche age, COC use), heredity. The sections present the effect of menopausal transition on the development of depression, mood changes, sleep disturbances and mental disabilities. The explanation of negative effects of menopausal hormone therapy to cognitive health is also described by modern point of view. The ambivalent opinions of researchers, the potential of new reading of the results of earlier studies, confirms the necessity of continuing study of this topic.
Увеличение численности населения старшей возрастной группы определяет возникновение новых вопросов, связанных с изучением возраст-ассоциированных заболеваний. В женском организме вступление в период менопаузального перехода является началом «старения» репродуктивной функции, что, в свою очередь, приводит к снижению уровней половых гормонов. Выявлена прямая связь между нарушениями соотношений эстрогенов, прогестерона, андрогенов и когнитивной активностью женщин. Данные анатомической локализации рецепторов половых гормонов, механизмы взаимодействия гормонов с этими рецепторами, пути реализации биологических эффектов объясняют действие стероидов на центральную нервную систему. Современные теории «здоровых клеток» и «эуэстрогении» объясняют влияния дополнительных критериев, таких как отсутствие неврологических заболеваний в анамнезе и длительность гипоэстрогении, на результат менопаузальной гормональной терапии (МГТ). К дополнительным факторам, способным повлиять на эффект МГТ, относятся состав гормональной терапии, дозы, методы введения, режимы (циклический, непрерывный), длительность лечения, наличие эндокринных заболеваний в анамнезе, в частности сахарного диабета, гинекологический анамнез (паритет, возраст менархе, применение комбинированных оральных контрацептивов), наследственность. В разделах изложены данные литературы о влиянии менопаузального перехода на развитие депрессии, изменения настроения, нарушения сна и ментальные способности. Также описываются данные современных исследований, направленных на объяснение отрицательных эффектов МГТ, описываемых в данных крупных рандомизированных исследований конца ХХ и начала ХХI вв. Противоречивость мнений современных исследователей, возможности нового прочтения результатов более ранних исследований подтверждают необходимость продолжения изучения данной темы.",[],Problemy endokrinologii,2023-02-27,"[{'lastname': 'Gasparyan', 'firstname': 'S A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Stavropol State Medical University.'}, {'lastname': 'Chotchaeva', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Stavropol State Medical University.'}, {'lastname': 'Karpov', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Stavropol State Medical University.'}]",,,,,"10.14341/probl13205

23023994",A Systematic Review on the Potential Acceleration of Neurocognitive Aging in Older Cancer Survivors.,"As survival rates increase, more emphasis has gone to possible cognitive sequelae in older cancer patients, which could be explained by accelerated brain aging. In this review, we provide a complete overview of studies investigating neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and neurodegenerative disorders in older cancer survivors (>65 years), based on three databases (Pubmed, Web of Science and Medline). Ninety-six studies were included. Evidence was found for functional and structural brain changes (frontal regions, basal ganglia, gray and white matter), compared to healthy controls. Cognitive decline was mainly found in memory functioning. Anti-hormonal treatments were repeatedly associated with cognitive decline (tamoxifen) and sometimes with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (androgen deprivation therapy). Chemotherapy was inconsistently associated with later development of cognitive changes or dementia. Radiotherapy was not associated with cognition in patients with non-central nervous system cancer but can play a role in patients with central nervous system cancer, while neurosurgery seemed to improve their cognition in the short-term. Individual risk factors included cancer subtypes (e.g., brain cancer, hormone-related cancers), treatment (e.g., anti-hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, cranial radiation), genetic predisposition (e.g., APOE, COMT, BDNF), age, comorbidities (e.g., frailty, cognitive reserve), and psychological (e.g., depression, (post-traumatic) distress, sleep, fatigue) and social factors (e.g., loneliness, limited caregiver support, low SES). More research on accelerated aging is required to guide intervention studies.","['aging', 'cancer survivors', 'cognition', 'neurodegeneration', 'older']",Cancers,2023-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Kerstens', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, University Hospital Ghent, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Wildiers', 'firstname': 'Hans P M W', 'initials': 'HPMW', 'affiliation': 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nDepartment of General Medical Oncology and Multidisciplinary Breast Centre, University Hospitals Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nLaboratory of Experimental Oncology (LEO), Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Schroyen', 'firstname': 'Gwen', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nLeuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nDepartment of Imaging and Pathology, Translational MRI, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Almela', 'firstname': 'Mercedes', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuropsychology, Tilburg University, 5030AB Tilburg, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Mark', 'firstname': 'Ruth E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuropsychology, Tilburg University, 5030AB Tilburg, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Lambrecht', 'firstname': 'Maarten', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nLaboratory of Experimental Radiotherapy, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nDepartment of Radiotherapy, University Hospitals Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Deprez', 'firstname': 'Sabine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nLeuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nDepartment of Imaging and Pathology, Translational MRI, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Sleurs', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nLeuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.\nDepartment of Cognitive Neuropsychology, Tilburg University, 5030AB Tilburg, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/cancers15041215

17695343",Exercise Associated with Cognitive Function in Older Men with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy.,"To examine associations between exercise and cognitive function in older men undergoing hormone therapy for prostate cancer.
Men ≥ 65 years old with prostate cancer, currently undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for ≥ 6 months (n = 50), completed the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, and standard neuropsychological tests. Pearson's correlations and linear regressions were used to examine associations between exercise and cognitive performance.
Exercise was significantly positively correlated with performance on tests of memory, attention, and executive function. Linear regressions showed that when controlling for age and education, exercise remained a significant predictor of attention and executive function performance (p < 0.05), and showed moderate, but statistically non-significant effects on memory performance (p < 0.10).
Greater exercise is associated with better functioning in multiple cognitive domains in men with prostate cancer undergoing hormone therapy, providing proof-of-concept evidence that exercise may be a feasible intervention to limit cognitive dysfunction in prostate cancer patients.","['Androgen deprivation therapy', 'Cognition', 'Exercise', 'Hormone therapy', 'Physical activity', 'Prostate cancer']",International journal of behavioral medicine,2023-01-31,"[{'lastname': 'Gaynor', 'firstname': 'Alexandra M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. ag4498@cumc.columbia.edu.\nTaub Institute for Research On Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA. ag4498@cumc.columbia.edu.""}, {'lastname': 'Flaherty', 'firstname': 'Kathleen R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Root', 'firstname': 'James C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Salas-Ramirez', 'firstname': 'Kaliris Y', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': 'City University of New York School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Scott', 'firstname': 'Jessica M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'Christian J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}]","Men ≥ 65 years old with prostate cancer, currently undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for ≥ 6 months (n = 50), completed the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, and standard neuropsychological tests.

29111960","Sex hormones, SHBG and cognitive performance among older Australian women: an observational study.","This study aims to explore the associations between sex hormones and cognitive performance in older women.
Associations between sex hormones, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and cognitive performance were examined in women aged at least 70 years, without dementia and not using medications that influence sex hormones. Linear and generalized linear regression models included age, body mass index, education, smoking, alcohol, living circumstances, diabetes, hypertension, depression and impaired renal function.
The included 5511 women had a median (interquartile range) age of 73.9 (71.6-77.6) years. No associations were found for estrone, estradiol, testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone and cognitive performance. SHBG concentrations above quartile 1 (Q1) were significantly inversely associated with processing speed (Q2, 
Sex hormones were not associated with cognitive performance. The finding that low SHBG is associated with better processing speed warrants further investigation. The null findings for the sex hormones establish a firm baseline to confidently explore the association between sex hormones and longitudinal cognitive performance in this population.

28042040",Endophenotypic correlates of cognitive function in reproductive-age individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"To characterize cognitive performance in relation to hormonal and metabolic factors in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Cross-sectional study.
Tertiary university center.
A total of 48 individuals, aged 21-46 years, with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria.
Complete history and physical examinations, endovaginal ultrasounds, dermatologic assessments, neuropsychological assessments, and metabolic and hormonal serum tests.
Sample-based z-scores on a comprehensive cognitive test battery.
Subjects were defined as having an androgenic (n = 31) or a nonandrogenic (n = 17) PCOS phenotype. Compared with their nonandrogenized counterparts, subjects with hyperandrogenism demonstrated lower relative performance on the tests of executive function (β-coefficient for the executive function composite z-score, -0.44; 95% confidence interval, -0.79 to -0.09), despite similar performance on the tests of memory, verbal reasoning, and perceptual reasoning. These differences were independent of age, years of education, and obesity. In an exploratory analysis in which subjects were stratified by the presence of insulin resistance (IR), subjects with PCOS with both IR and hyperandrogenism showed the lowest performance on a composite score of executive function, followed by those with hyperandrogenism alone.
In this small study, subjects with hyperandrogenic PCOS demonstrated lower performance on the tests of executive function than subjects with nonandrogenic PCOS. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings in larger cohorts and investigate the role of modifiable factors, including IR, on cognitive outcomes.","['Polycystic ovary syndrome', 'cognition', 'depression', 'hyperandrogenism', 'insulin resistance']",F&S reports,2022-12-27,"[{'lastname': 'Huddleston', 'firstname': 'Heather G', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Casaletto', 'firstname': 'Kaitlin B', 'initials': 'KB', 'affiliation': 'Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Jaswa', 'firstname': 'Eleni G', 'initials': 'EG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Rasgon', 'firstname': 'Natalie L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Maki', 'firstname': 'Pauline P', 'initials': 'PP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Cedars', 'firstname': 'Marcelle I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasch', 'firstname': 'Lauri', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.'}]",,,"Subjects were defined as having an androgenic (n = 31) or a nonandrogenic (n = 17) PCOS phenotype.

55,36481265,Effect of exogenous testosterone in the context of energy deficit on risky choice: Behavioural and neural evidence from males.,"Previous research has shown greater risk aversion when people make choices about lives than cash. We tested the hypothesis that compared to placebo, exogenous testosterone administration would lead to riskier choices about cash than lives, given testosterone's association with financial risk-taking and reward sensitivity. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted to test this hypothesis (Clinical Trials Registry: NCT02734238, www.clinicaltrials.gov). We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 50 non-obese males before and shortly after 28 days of severe exercise-and-diet-induced energy deficit, during which testosterone (200 mg testosterone enanthate per week in sesame oil) or placebo (sesame seed oil only) was administered. Because we expected circulating testosterone levels to be reduced due to severe energy deficit, testosterone administration served a restorative function to mitigate the impact of energy deficit on testosterone levels. The fMRI task involved making choices under uncertainty for lives and cash. We also manipulated whether the outcomes were presented as gains or losses. Consistent with prospect theory, we observed the reflection effect such that participants were more risk averse when outcomes were presented as gains than losses. Brain activation in the thalamus covaried with individual differences in exhibiting the reflection effect. Testosterone did not impact choice, but it increased sensitivity to negative feedback following risky choices. These results suggest that exogenous testosterone administration in the context of energy deficit can impact some aspects of risky choice, and that individual differences in the reflection effect engage a brain structure involved in processing emotion, reward and risk.","['Prospect theory', 'Risky choice', 'Testosterone', 'Thalamus']",Biological psychology,2022-12-09,"[{'lastname': 'Vartanian', 'firstname': 'Oshin', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Defence Research and Development Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

56,36470319,Male minipuberty involves the gonad-independent activation of preoptic nNOS neurons.,"The maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is crucial for the establishment of reproductive function. In female mice, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity appears to be key for the first postnatal activation of the neural network promoting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), i.e. minipuberty. However, in males, the profile of minipuberty as well as the role of nNOS-expressing neurons remain unexplored.
nNOS-deficient and wild-type mice were studied during postnatal development. The expression of androgen (AR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) as well as nNOS phosphorylation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in nNOS neurons in the median preoptic nucleus (MePO), where most GnRH neuronal cell bodies reside, and the hormonal profile of nNOS-deficient male mice was assessed using previously established radioimmunoassay and ELISA methods. Gonadectomy and pharmacological manipulation of ERα were used to elucidate the mechanism of minipubertal nNOS activation and the maturation of the HPG axis.
In male mice, minipubertal FSH release occurred at P23, preceding the LH surge at P30, when balanopreputial separation occurs. Progesterone and testosterone remained low during minipuberty, increasing around puberty, whereas estrogen levels were high throughout postnatal development. nNOS neurons showed a sharp increase in Ser
Our results show that the timing of minipuberty differs in male mice when compared to females, but as in the latter, nNOS activity in the preoptic region plays a role in this process. Additionally, akin to male non-human primates, the profile of minipuberty in male mice is shaped by sex-independent mechanisms, and possibly involves extragonadal estrogen sources.","['Estrogen', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)', 'Hypothalamus', 'Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)', 'minipuberty']",Free radical biology & medicine,2022-12-06,"[{'lastname': 'Delli', 'firstname': 'Virginia', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Univ.

A cross-sectional study.","We investigated whether there were differences in associations between cognition with muscle strength, fitness and function in men with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with, and without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and non-PCa controls. A secondary aim was to compare differences in the prevalence of cognitive impairment.
This cross-sectional study compared 70 ADT-treated men with PCa aged 50-85 years to non-ADT-treated men (n=52) and non-PCa controls (n=70).
University clinical exercise laboratory.
Nil.
Standardised assessments were conducted for cognition (learning, memory, attention, processing speed and executive function), muscle strength (grip strength and leg press), fitness (400 m walk), gait speed (4 m walk) and dual-tasking mobility (timed-up-and-go with a cognitive task).
ADT-treated men showed stronger associations between fitness and executive function and task switching relative to controls (both: p≤0.03). For both PCa groups (independent of ADT use), poorer dual-task mobility was more strongly associated with decreased psychomotor attention (both: p≤0.027) and global cognitive function (both: p≤0.031) compared with non-PCa controls. The overall prevalence of cognitive impairment was low (4%-13%) and did not differ between the groups.
The presence of PCa, with or without ADT treatment, did not increase the risk of cognitive impairment relative to non-PCa controls, yet did alter the associations between physical fitness and some measures of functional performance with certain cognitive domains. This highlights the importance of men with PCa maintaining fitness and functional capacity to optimise cognitive health.

58,36403781,"The androgen system across the menstrual cycle: Hormonal, (epi-)genetic and psychometric alterations.","The menstrual cycle is characterized by various hormonal alterations and associations with mental and physical conditions have been postulated. Among endocrine factors, the androgen system has been a target of major interest in males and to a lesser extent in females and may influence emotion, cognition, behavior and somatic factors. Only few studies investigated alterations of these parameters throughout the menstrual cycle and there is a lack of studies exploring a link towards epigenetic and genetic regulation. This multisite longitudinal study examines behavioral parameters including affectivity, stress perception and various diary parameters of mental and physical well-being in conjunction with testosterone and LH plasma levels in 87 menstruating women. Additionally, Cysteine-Adenenine-Guanin (CAG) repeat length and methylation of the androgen receptor gene collected at four time points across two cycles comprising the menstrual, pre-ovulatory, mid-luteal and premenstrual phase were assesed. There was a significant increase of LH and testosterone plasma levels during the pre-ovulatory phase as well as a decrease of methylation of the androgen receptor at mid-luteal phase. Subjective ratings of physical condition and sexual interest peaked during the pre-ovulatory phase and the former correlated negatively with the androgen receptor gene methylation level. This longitudinal study shows alterations of the androgen system including epigenetic measurements throughout the menstrual cycle. While a link between peripheral testosterone and sexual activity and between increased physical condition and an upregulation of testosterone receptor protein expression can be assumed, the majority of parameters remained unchanged. These initial findings need validation by subsequent studies.","['Androgen receptor', 'Menstrual cycle', 'Methylation', 'Psychometric']",Physiology & behavior,2022-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Krüger', 'firstname': 'Tillmann H C', 'initials': 'THC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Section of Clinical Psychology and Sexual Medicine, Medical School Hannover, Germany; Center for Systems Neuroscience, Hannover, Germany.

20600171","Age, adrenal steroids, and cognitive functioning in captive chimpanzees (","Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate is the most abundant circulating androgen in humans and other catarrhines. It is involved in several biological functions, such as testosterone production, glucocorticoid antagonist actions, neurogenesis and neuroplasticty. Although the role of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) in cognition remains elusive, the DHEAS/cortisol ratio has been positively associated with a slower cognitive age-decline and improved mood in humans. Whether this relationship is found in nonhuman primates remains unknown.
We measured DHEAS and cortisol levels in serum of 107 adult chimpanzees to investigate the relationship between DHEAS levels and age. A subset of 21 chimpanzees was used to test the potential associations between DHEAS, cortisol, and DHEAS/cortisol ratio in cognitive function, taking into account age, sex, and their interactions. We tested for cognitive function using the primate cognitive test battery (PCTB) and principal component analyses to categorize cognition into three components: 
DHEAS levels, but not the DHEAS/cortisol ratio, declined with age in chimpanzees.

27513910",Contrasting parental roles shape sex differences in poison frog space use but not navigational performance.,"Sex differences in vertebrate spatial abilities are typically interpreted under the adaptive specialization hypothesis, which posits that male reproductive success is linked to larger home ranges and better navigational skills. The androgen spillover hypothesis counters that enhanced male spatial performance may be a byproduct of higher androgen levels. Animal groups that include species where females are expected to outperform males based on life-history traits are key for disentangling these hypotheses. We investigated the association between sex differences in reproductive strategies, spatial behavior, and androgen levels in three species of poison frogs. We tracked individuals in natural environments to show that contrasting parental sex roles shape sex differences in space use, where the sex performing parental duties shows wider-ranging movements. We then translocated frogs from their home areas to test their navigational performance and found that the caring sex outperformed the non-caring sex only in one out of three species. In addition, males across species displayed more explorative behavior than females and androgen levels correlated with explorative behavior and homing accuracy. Overall, we reveal that poison frog reproductive strategies shape movement patterns but not necessarily navigational performance. Together this work suggests that prevailing adaptive hypotheses provide an incomplete explanation of sex differences in spatial abilities.","['Allobates femoralis', 'Dendrobates tinctorius', 'Oophaga sylvatica', 'adaptive specialization hypothesis', 'amphibians', 'ecology', 'evolutionary biology', 'testosterone spillover']",eLife,2022-11-16,"[{'lastname': 'Pašukonis', 'firstname': 'Andrius', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biosciences, Vilnius University Life Sciences Center, Vilnius, Lithuania.\nCEFE, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\nDepartment of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Serrano-Rojas', 'firstname': 'Shirley Jennifer', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, United States.\nUniversidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco, Cusco, Peru.'}, {'lastname': 'Fischer', 'firstname': 'Marie-Therese', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Loretto', 'firstname': 'Matthias-Claudio', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Technical University of Munich, TUM School of Life Sciences, Ecosystem Dynamics and Forest Management, Hans-Carl-von-Carlowitz-Platz, Freising, Germany.\nBerchtesgaden National Park, Doktorberg, Berchtesgaden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Shaykevich', 'firstname': 'Daniel A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Rojas', 'firstname': 'Bibiana', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Interdisciplinary Life Sciences, Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Biology and Environmental Science, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ringler', 'firstname': 'Max', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Behavioural Ecology, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern, Hinterkappelen, Switzerland.\nInstitute of Electronic Music and Acoustics, University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, Graz, Austria.\nDepartment of Behavioral and Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Evolutionary Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Roland', 'firstname': 'Alexandre B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Research Center on Animal Cognition, Center for Integrative Biology, CNRS - Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Marcillo-Lara', 'firstname': 'Alejandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Integrative Biology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, United States.\nCentro Jambatu de Investigación y Conservación de Anfibios, Quito, Ecuador.'}, {'lastname': 'Ringler', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Behavioural Ecology, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern, Hinterkappelen, Switzerland.\nMesserli Research Institute, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez', 'firstname': 'Camilo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioral and Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Coloma', 'firstname': 'Luis A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Centro Jambatu de Investigación y Conservación de Anfibios, Quito, Ecuador.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Connell"", 'firstname': 'Lauren A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, United States.'}]",,,,"© 2022, Pašukonis et al.","10.7554/eLife.80483

32153385",Adrenal aging and its effects on the stress response and immunosenescence.,"Normal aging is linked to various endocrine gland changes, including changes in the adrenal glands. Aging is linked to alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including an increase in cortisol levels, a disruption of the negative cortisol feedback, and attenuation of cortisol's diurnal pattern. In addition, secretion of aldosterone and adrenal androgens [dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS)] from the adrenal cortex decreases with aging. In this review, we describe normal adrenal function, the adrenal response to stress and immunomodulation in aging individuals as well as the effects of adrenal aging on body composition, metabolic profile, bone health and cognition.","['Adrenal aging', 'Adrenal glands', 'Immunosenescence', 'Stress']",Maturitas,2022-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Stamou', 'firstname': 'Maria I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

62,36366914,Association between testosterone and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women: a systematic review of observational studies.,"This review was conducted to explore the association between endogenous testosterone blood concentrations and cognitive performance among community dwelling postmenopausal women. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for observational studies with at least 100 postmenopausal participants. The results were categorized by study design, reporting of total or free testosterone and risk of bias assessments, narratively. Ten of the 26 articles retrieved for full-text review met the inclusion criteria, six provided cross-sectional data, seven provided longitudinal data and one provided case-control data. Cognitive performance tests differed between studies. Eight studies measured testosterone by immunoassay, one by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and one did not specify their methodology. Eleven different cognitive domains were tested by 37 different instruments. Irrespective of the study design, the findings were inconsistent and inconclusive. Both positive and inverse associations were reported for each of global cognition and immediate and delayed verbal recall. The majority of studies reported no association between total or free testosterone and cognitive performance. Although this review did not demonstrate an association between testosterone and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women, the findings should be considered inconclusive due to the imprecision of testosterone measurement and the methodological heterogeneity of the included studies.","['Postmenopause', 'androgen', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'dementia', 'testosterone']",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2022-11-12,"[{'lastname': 'Sultana', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Women's Health Research Program, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.\nEnvironmental Interventions Unit, Infectious Diseases Division, icddr,b, Dhaka, Bangladesh.""}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'S R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': ""Women's Health Research Program, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Alfred Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Bell', 'firstname': 'R J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': ""Women's Health Research Program, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Women's Health Research Program, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Islam', 'firstname': 'R M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': ""Women's Health Research Program, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}]",,,,,10.1080/13697137.2022.2139600,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05d9f14860>,,,,,,
63,36351662,Associations between salivary testosterone levels and cognitive function among 70-year-old Japanese elderly: A cross-sectional analysis of the SONIC study.,"This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the associations between salivary testosterone concentrations and cognitive function in 70-year-old Japanese elderly people without dementia and stroke.
Participants were 197 Japanese community-dwelling people aged 69-71 years. Their salivary samples were collected, and their cognitive function was assessed using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). Participants were also administered a 10-item recall and a 24-item recognition test. The data for 179 (106 men and 73 women) individuals were analyzed, excluding individuals with a past history of stroke and dementia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed after adjusting for lifestyle factors and analyzing data separately for men and women.
MoCA-J scores showed that men with low testosterone concentrations had a significantly greater risk of low cognitive performance than those with high testosterone concentrations (adjusted odds ratio: 4.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-21.00), while no significant association was found in women. The 10-item recall test scores showed that higher testosterone concentrations were significantly associated with greater recall in the second trial in women (standardized beta = 0.24, P = 0.040), whereas no significant association was found in men. Salivary testosterone concentrations were positively associated with better cognitive performance in older men and women.
The associations between salivary testosterone concentrations and cognitive function were shown by different tasks for men and women.

24428527",[Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease].,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia in half of the cases. Asthma is usually found in people over 65 years of age. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is multifactorial and includes genetic factors, nutritional disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and aging. Sex hormones have an important influence on the development of AD, as evidenced by a higher incidence in women than in men. Considering the significant influence of T on the maintenance of normal brain function, the present study is aimed at evaluating the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), as well as testosterone therapy, on the risk of AD development and progression. Although there is some clinical inconsistency between studies, androgens have a significant effect on brain function and are beneficial for AD patients. Low levels of circulating androgens should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of AD and memory loss. With a reduced level of T in the plasma of men, its administration improves cognitive performance and memory, treatment should be started at an early stage of the disease. In men and women with AD, androgens improve mental state and slow the progression of the disease, providing a protective effect. In the future, it is necessary to conduct studies on a large population, taking into account personality factors and a more specific approach to assessing cognitive functions and the causal relationship of T administration in AD.
Болезнь Альцгеймера (БА) является нейродегенеративным заболеванием, которое становится причиной деменции в половине случаев ее возникновения. БА, как правило, обнаруживается у людей старше 65 лет. Этиопатогенез заболевания является многофакторным и включает генетические факторы, нарушения питания, митохондриальную дисфункцию, окислительный стресс и старение. Половые гормоны оказывают важное влияние на развитие БА, о чем свидетельствует большая заболеваемость у женщин, чем у мужчин. Учитывая значительное влияние тестостерона (Т) на поддержание нормального функционирования головного мозга, настоящее исследование направлено на оценку влияния андроген-депривационной терапии, а также терапии тестостероном на риск развития и прогрессирования БА. Хотя между исследованиями существует некоторое клиническое несоответствие, андрогены оказывают значительное влияние на функцию головного мозга и полезны для пациентов с БА. Низкие уровни циркулирующих андрогенов следует рассматривать как существенный фактор риска развития БА и потери памяти. При сниженном уровне Т в плазме мужчин его введение способствует повышению когнитивной работоспособности и памяти, лечение следует начинать на ранней стадии заболевания.

21354373",Functional impact of androgen-targeted therapy on patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs) extend metastasis-free survival, prolong overall survival, and delay symptoms when added to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of castration-sensitive or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, ARIs may adversely impact physical and cognitive function, thereby decreasing quality of life and prognosis.
To evaluate the evidence regarding the potential effects of ARIs on physical and cognitive function and to contextualize how drug-related adverse effects may influence treatment decisions in CRPC.
We performed a literature search using MEDLINE from January 1998 to June 2020 using terms relating to prostate cancer, androgen deprivation, and physical and cognitive function. We selected 61 publications for analysis.
Treatment-induced deterioration in physical and cognitive function may impair the independence and well-being of patients with CRPC. Patient-reported outcomes from clinical trials of ARIs provide quantitative evidence of their impact on these domains, which appears to vary between ARIs, reflecting the different adverse event profiles of these agents. Thus, the risk of physical or cognitive dysfunction may be managed or mitigated by appropriate selection of treatment options. Studies in patients with CRPC have assessed the cognitive effects of ARIs with validated instruments, whereas quantitative analysis of the impact on physical function has been limited.
Several validated instruments utilized for the assessment of physical and cognitive function in clinical studies have been adapted for clinical practice; however, consensus on the standardization of these assessments is required. Future clinical studies employing validated tools may generate data on the impact of ARIs and guide treatment decisions for patients with CRPC.
We review the hormonal therapies used to treat men with prostate cancer and the effects they have on physical and cognitive function. We discuss how to measure these effects and how this may assist when choosing treatment.","['androgen deprivation therapy', 'androgen‐targeted therapy', 'castration‐resistant prostate cancer', 'cognitive function', 'physical function']",BJUI compass,2022-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Beer', 'firstname': 'Tomasz M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'Oregon Health and Science University Knight Cancer Institute Portland Oregon USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shore', 'firstname': 'Neal', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Carolina Urologic Research Center Myrtle Beach South Carolina USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Morgans', 'firstname': 'Alicia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Boston Massachusetts USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Winters-Stone', 'firstname': 'Kerri', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Oregon Health and Science University Knight Cancer Institute Portland Oregon USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wefel', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston Texas USA.'}, {'lastname': 'George', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Duke Cancer Institute Durham North Carolina USA.'}]",,"Several validated instruments utilized for the assessment of physical and cognitive function in clinical studies have been adapted for clinical practice; however, consensus on the standardization of these assessments is required.

18333959",Changes in sex differences in neuroanatomical structure and cognitive behavior across the life span.,"Sex differences occur in the structure and function of the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus, which can change from the juvenile period through old age. Although the evidence is incomplete, it appears that in at least some portions of the cortex these differences develop due to the rise of ovarian hormones at puberty and are potentially not dependent on the perinatal rise in testosterone, which is essential for sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus and sexual behavior. During aging of female rats, the presence of continued ovarian hormone secretion after cessation of the estrous cycle also influences sex differences in neuroanatomical structure and cognitive behavior, resulting in nullification or reversal of sex differences seen in younger adults. Sex differences can be altered by experience in a stimulating environment during the juvenile/adolescent period, and sex differences in performance even can be affected by the parameters of a task. Thus, broad generalizations about differences such as ""spatial ability"" are to be avoided. It is clear that to understand how the brain produces behavior, sex and hormones have to be taken into account.",[],"Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)",2022-10-08,"[{'lastname': 'Juraska', 'firstname': 'Janice M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Program in Neuroscience, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois 61820, USA jjuraska@illinois.edu.'}]",,,,© 2022 Juraska; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.,"10.1101/lm.053499.121

26988999",Duration of oral contraceptive use relates to cognitive performance and brain activation in current and past users.,"Previous studies indicate effects of oral contraceptive (OC) use on spatial and verbal cognition. However, a better understanding of the OC effects is still needed, including the differential effects of androgenic or anti-androgenic OC use and whether the possible impact persists beyond the OC use. We aim to investigate the associations of OC use duration with spatial and verbal cognition, differentiating between androgenic and anti-androgenic OC. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we scanned a group of 94 past and current OC-users in a single session. We grouped current OC users (N=53) and past OC users with a natural cycle (N=41) into androgenic and anti-androgenic user. Effects of OC use duration were observed for current use and after discontinuation. Duration of OC use was reflected only in verbal fluency performance but not navigation: The longer the current OC use, the less words were produced in the verbal fluency task. During navigation, deactivation in the caudate and postcentral gyrus was duration-dependent in current androgenic OC users. Only during the verbal fluency task, duration of previous OC use affects several brain parameters, including activation of the left putamen and connectivity between right-hemispheric language areas (i.e., right inferior frontal gyrus and right angular gyrus). The results regarding performance and brain activation point towards stronger organizational effects of OCs on verbal rather than spatial processing. Irrespective of the task, a duration-dependent connectivity between the hippocampus and various occipital areas was observed. This could suggest a shift in strategy or processing style with long-term contraceptive use during navigation/verbal fluency. The current findings suggest a key role of the progestogenic component of OCs in both tasks. The influence of OC use on verbal fluency remains even after discontinuation which further points out the importance of future studies on OC effects and their reversibility.","['androgenicity', 'brain activation and connectivity', 'duration of OC use', 'navigation', 'oral contraceptives (OC)', 'progestins', 'sex hormones', 'verbal fluency']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-10-08,"[{'lastname': 'Noachtar', 'firstname': 'Isabel Asar', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hidalgo-Lopez', 'firstname': 'Esmeralda', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Pletzer', 'firstname': 'Belinda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Noachtar, Hidalgo-Lopez and Pletzer.","10.3389/fendo.2022.885617

17998077",Testosterone replacement in prostate cancer survivors with testosterone deficiency: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.,"Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer today have organ-confined disease and low risk of disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Testosterone deficiency in prostate cancer survivors contributes to impaired health-related quality of life but testosterone treatment is viewed as a contraindication in this population.
We describe the design of the first randomized trial to determine the safety and efficacy of testosterone treatment in men who have undergone prostatectomy for non-aggressive prostate cancer and have symptomatic testosterone deficiency.
Surviving Prostate cancer while Improving quality of life through Rehabilitation with Testosterone Trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial in 142 men, ≥ 40 years, who have undergone radical prostatectomy for organ-confined prostate cancer, Gleason score ≤ 7 (3+4), Stage pT2, N0, M0 lesions and have symptomatic testosterone deficiency and undetectable prostate specific antigen for > 2 years after surgery. Eligible participants are randomized to weekly intramuscular injections of 100-mg testosterone cypionate or placebo for 12 weeks and followed for another 12 weeks. Primary endpoint is change from baseline in sexual activity. Secondary outcomes include change in sexual desire, erectile function, energy, lean and fat mass, physical and cognitive performance. Safety is assessed by monitoring prostate-specific antigen, lower urinary tract symptoms, hemoglobin, and adverse events.
The trial is being conducted at two trial sites in Boston, MA and Baltimore, MD. As of July 30, 2022, 42 participants have been randomized. No prostate-specific antigen or clinical recurrence has been noted to-date.
Recruitment was slowed by coronavirus disease 2019-related closures, slow subsequent ramp-up of research activities, and patient concerns about safety of testosterone treatment. Despite these challenges, participant retention has been high.
The Surviving Prostate cancer while Improving quality of life through Rehabilitation with Testosterone Trial, a placebo-controlled, randomized trial, will determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is safe and efficacious in correcting symptoms of testosterone deficiency in prostate cancer survivors, and potentially inform clinical practice.","['hypogonadism', 'prostate cancer', 'prostatectomy', 'testosterone treatment']",Andrology,2022-10-02,"[{'lastname': 'Valderrábano', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Pencina', 'firstname': 'Karol', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Storer', 'firstname': 'Thomas W', 'initials': 'TW', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Reid', 'firstname': 'Kieran F', 'initials': 'KF', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Kibel', 'firstname': 'Adam S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Burnett', 'firstname': 'Arthur L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Grace', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Dorff', 'firstname': 'Tanya', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Privat', 'firstname': 'Fabiola', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Ghattas-Puylara', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Lauren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Latham', 'firstname': 'Nancy K', 'initials': 'NK', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Holmberg', 'firstname': 'Mats', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ANOVA, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medicine, Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhasin', 'firstname': 'Shalender', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health, Aging, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}]",,"The Surviving Prostate cancer while Improving quality of life through Rehabilitation with Testosterone Trial, a placebo-controlled, randomized trial, will determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is safe and efficacious in correcting symptoms of testosterone deficiency in prostate cancer survivors, and potentially inform clinical practice.","The trial is being conducted at two trial sites in Boston, MA and Baltimore, MD.

69,36154817,"Hormonal contraceptive influences on cognition and psychopathology: Past methods, present inferences, and future directions.","In the last decade, there has been a remarkable surge in research on the neural and behavioral correlates of hormonal contraceptive use, particularly oral contraceptive use. Questions have evolved swiftly and notably, with studies no longer revealing if hormonal contraceptives matter for the brain and behavior, but rather how, when, and for whom they matter most. Paralleling this shift, the goal of this review is to move beyond an average synthesis of hormonal contraceptive influences on human cognition and psychopathology (and their neural substrates) in order to consider the nature and specificity of effects. Accompanied by an evaluation of study methods and informed by findings from animal models, this consideration uncovers promising areas of research in the next ten years, including potential activational and organizational effects of hormonal contraceptive use, individual differences in effects that matter for the wellbeing of unique individuals, and correlates of intrauterine device use.","['Androgenic activity', 'Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Estrogenic activity', 'Intrauterine device', 'Oral contraceptive', 'Person specificity', 'Progestational activity', 'Spatial skills', 'Verbal memory']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2022-09-27,"[{'lastname': 'Beltz', 'firstname': 'Adriene M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'University of Michigan, 2227 East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Abor, MI 48109, USA.

70,36154816,Review of the effects of polycystic ovary syndrome on Cognition: Looking beyond the androgen hypothesis.,"Polycystic-ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, and many features associated with PCOS - such as elevated androgens, insulin resistance and inflammation - are known to affect cognition. However, effects of PCOS on cognition are not well-understood. Here we review the current literature on PCOS and cognition, note the extent of PCOS symptomatology studied in relation to cognitive outcomes, and identify key research gaps and common methodological concerns. Findings indicate a pattern of worse performance across cognitive domains and brain measures in women with PCOS relative to non-PCOS controls, as well as a lack of evidence for the common assumption that women with PCOS will have higher performance on tasks with a demonstrated male-advantage due to high testosterone levels. We suggest strategies for moving beyond the focus on elevated androgens, in favor of research practices that account for the nuances and heterogeneity of PCOS symptoms.","['Cognition', 'Cognitive function', 'Insulin resistance', 'PCOS', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome', 'Review', 'Sex hormones', 'Testosterone', 'Women’s health']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2022-09-27,"[{'lastname': 'Perović', 'firstname': 'Mateja', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

24086383","Salivary testosterone in male and female youth with and without autism spectrum disorder: considerations of development, sex, and diagnosis.","Puberty is characterized by significant physical, hormonal, and psychological changes, which may be especially challenging for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although the etiology of ASD remains uncertain, studies suggest imbalances in hormones, such as testosterone, may modulate the autism phenotype. While differences in fetal and postnatal testosterone have been reported, there is limited literature regarding testosterone variations during adolescence in ASD. We investigated morning salivary testosterone levels in youth with ASD and typical development (TD) to explore hypothesized differences, expecting elevated hormonal levels in ASD compared to TD.
Youth with ASD (n = 140) and TD (n = 104), ages 10 to 13 years, were enrolled as part of a longitudinal study on pubertal development. Pubertal stage was determined by gold standard physical examination, and salivary testosterone was collected in the morning immediately upon waking and 30 min after waking and averaged across 3 days. Diagnostic (ASD/TD) and sex (male/female) differences, as well as interactions with age and puberty, were examined using robust linear mixed effect models.
Youth with ASD showed significantly elevated testosterone concentrations compared to same-age TD peers. After the inclusion of natural cubic splines to account for nonlinearity in age, a significant age-by-sex interaction emerged with distinct developmental slopes for males and females. At younger ages, females had higher testosterone, until about 11.5 years of age, when levels began to plateau, while male testosterone concentrations continued to rapidly increase and surpass females. As expected, more advanced pubertal development was associated with elevated testosterone. In contrast, no significant effect of parent-reported social communication symptoms was observed.
Limitations include an unequal sex distribution, non-representative sample (e.g., cognition and race/ethnicity), and inability to examine afternoon/evening testosterone due to detection limits.
Testosterone may play a unique role in the presentation of ASD, especially during periods of dynamic hormonal changes including puberty. Inherent developmental (age, puberty) and sex-based (male, female) factors play a more prominent role in changes in testosterone levels during adolescence. Even so, future research is warranted to determine the differential expression and impact of exposure to excess testosterone during the pubertal transition for youth with ASD.","['Adolescence', 'Androgen', 'Autism', 'Pubertal development', 'Testosterone']",Molecular autism,2022-09-20,"[{'lastname': 'Muscatello', 'firstname': 'Rachael A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1500 21st Avenue South, Nashville, TN, 37212, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rafatjoo', 'firstname': 'Emma', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mirpuri', 'firstname': 'Karan K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': 'Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ahra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vandekar', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Corbett', 'firstname': 'Blythe A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1500 21st Avenue South, Nashville, TN, 37212, USA. blythe.corbett@vumc.org.\nVanderbilt Kennedy Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. blythe.corbett@vumc.org.\nDepartment of Psychology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA. blythe.corbett@vumc.org.'}]",,,"Youth with ASD showed significantly elevated testosterone concentrations compared to same-age TD peers.

74,36075276,"Hormonal contraceptives, stress, and the brain: The critical need for animal models.","Hormonal contraceptives are among the most important health and economic developments in the 20thCentury, providing unprecedented reproductive control and a range of health benefits including decreased premenstrual symptoms and protections against various cancers. Hormonal contraceptives modulate neural function and stress responsivity. These changes are usually innocuous or even beneficial, including their effects onmood. However, in approximately 4-10% of users, or up to 30 million people at any given time, hormonal contraceptives trigger depression or anxiety symptoms. How hormonal contraceptives contribute to these responses and who is at risk for adverse outcomes remain unknown. In this paper, we discussstudies of hormonal contraceptive use in humans and describe the ways in which laboratory animal models of contraceptive hormone exposure will be an essential tool for expanding findings to understand the precise mechanisms by which hormonal contraceptives influence the brain, stress responses, and depression risk.","['Androgenic', 'Cognition', 'Depression', 'Estradiol', 'HPA-axis', 'Motivation', 'Progestin', 'Reward', 'Rodent']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2022-09-09,"[{'lastname': 'Tronson', 'firstname': 'Natalie C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

31733195",The effect of hyperandrogenism and obesity on mindfulness and metacognition in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether serum androgen levels have an effect on mindfulness and metacognition in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Adolescents diagnosed with PCOS were asked to answer a questionnaire that included socio-demographic information and two scales: the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Metacognition Scale Child and Adolescent form (MCQ-C). The patients were divided into two groups, the hyperandrogenism group and the non-hyperandrogenism group, according to serum androgen levels. The scores of MAAS and MCQ-C were compared between the groups. The study sample consisted of 70 adolescents. Of these, 44 had hyperandrogenism according to a blood test. No statistically significant difference was found in MAAS scores between the hyperandrogenism and the non-hyperandrogenism groups (p = 0.79). However, the level of mindfulness was found to be lower in participants with a higher modified Ferriman-Gallwey score (mFGS) (r = 0.26, p = 0.02). Mindfulness levels were also lower for obese patients with PCOS compared to non-obese patients with PCOS (p = 0.02). Cognitive monitoring (MCQ-C-CM), one of the MCQ-C sub-scales, was significantly higher in the non-hyperandrogenism group (p = 0.03), and similarly, a positive correlation was detected between higher androgen levels and the positive meta-worry (MCQ-C-PM) sub-scale of the MCQ-C (for total testosterone; r = 0.348, p = 0.03, and for androstenedione; r = 0.35, p = 0.03). High serum androgen levels in PCOS had no effect on mindfulness, but as the modified Ferriman Gallwey score increased, mindfulness levels decreased. For the sub-scales of MCQ-C,MCQ-C-CM, and MCQ-C-PM, the scores increased as androgen levels increased. In line with the results of the present study, evaluating mindfulness in PCOS patients with increased hair growth and metacognition in PCOS patients with serum hyperandrogenism may contribute well-being in adulthood by reducing the psychological burden caused by the disease.","['Adolescent', 'Hyperandrogenism', 'Metacognition', 'Mindfulness', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome']",Archives of women's mental health,2022-09-09,"[{'lastname': 'Kara', 'firstname': 'Ozlem', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, University of Health Sciences Bursa Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Mimar Sinan Mah.

34346492",Quantitation of endogenous GnRH by validated nano-HPLC-HRMS method: a pilot study on ewe plasma.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone isoform I (GnRH), a neuro-deca-peptide, plays a fundamental role in development and maintenance of the reproductive system in vertebrates. The anomalous release of GnRH is observed in reproductive disorder such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or following prenatal exposure to elevated androgen levels. Quantitation of GnRH plasma levels could help to diagnose and better understand these pathologies. Here, a validated nano-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) method to quantify GnRH in ewe plasma samples is presented. Protein precipitation and solid-phase extraction (SPE) pre-treatment steps were required to purify and enrich GnRH and internal standard (lamprey-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-III, l-LHRH-III). For the validation process, a surrogate matrix approach was chosen following the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and FDA guidelines. Before the validation study, the validation model using the surrogate matrix was compared with those using a real matrix such as human plasma. All the tested parameters were analogous confirming the use of the surrogate matrix as a standard calibration medium. From the validation study, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) values of 0.008 and 0.024 ng/mL were obtained, respectively. Selectivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, and matrix effect were assessed with quality control samples in human plasma and all values were acceptable. Sixteen samples belonging to healthy and prenatal androgen (PNA) exposed ewes were collected and analyzed, and the GnRH levels ranged between 0.05 and 3.26 ng/mL. The nano-HPLC-HRMS developed here was successful in measuring GnRH, representing therefore a suitable technique to quantify GnRH in ewe plasma and to detect it in other matrices and species.","['Endogenous peptide', 'GnRH', 'Method validation', 'Nano-HPLC-HRMS', 'PNA', 'Surrogate matrix']",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2022-09-06,"[{'lastname': 'Mecarelli', 'firstname': 'Enrica', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, via Pietro Giuria 5, 10125, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Aigotti', 'firstname': 'Riccardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, via Pietro Giuria 5, 10125, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Asteggiano', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, via Pietro Giuria 5, 10125, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Giacobini', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'University Lille, Inserm, CHU Lille, Laboratory of Development and Plasticity of the Neuroendocrine Brain, Lille Neuroscience & Cognition, Inserm UMR-S1172, 59000, Lille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Chasles', 'firstname': 'Manon', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Tours, IFCE, Centre INRAE Val de Loire, 37380, Nouzilly, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tillet', 'firstname': 'Yves', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'University of Tours, IFCE, Centre INRAE Val de Loire, 37380, Nouzilly, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Dal Bello', 'firstname': 'Federica', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, via Pietro Giuria 5, 10125, Turin, Italy. federica.dalbello@unito.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Medana', 'firstname': 'Claudio', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, via Pietro Giuria 5, 10125, Turin, Italy.'}]",,,,© 2022.

77,36031012,"An empirical investigation of the roles of biological, relational, cognitive, and emotional factors in explaining sex differences in dyadic sexual desire.","One challenge many marital couples face is that they experience discrepant levels of sexual desire for one another. Such discrepancies are particularly likely to arise in mixed-sex relationships because, at least in long-term relationships, men tend to have higher levels of sexual desire for their partner than do women. But what underlies this sex difference? We used a dyadic study of 100 mixed-sex community-based newlywed spouses to investigate the role of biological, relational, cognitive, and emotional factors in explaining sex differences in dyadic sexual desire for a long-term partner. Consistent with predictions, wives on average reported lower daily sexual desire for their spouse than did husbands. Moreover, individual differences in men's and women's levels of circulating testosterone explained this sex difference whereas relational (marital satisfaction, commitment), cognitive (sex-role identification, stress, self-esteem), and emotional (mood, depressive symptoms) factors did not. These findings advance our knowledge of factors that influence dyadic sexual desire and may have practical implications for treating relationship distress in mixed-sex marriages.","['Dyadic sexual desire', 'Marriage', 'Sex differences', 'Testosterone']",Biological psychology,2022-08-29,"[{'lastname': 'French', 'firstname': 'Juliana E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma Center for Evolutionary Analysis, Oklahoma State University, 116 Psychology Building, Stillwater, OK 74078, USA.

78,36029803,"The effects of resistance training and spirulina on the performance of the antioxidant system with emphasis on mir125b, mir146a and cognitive function in stanazolol-induced neurotoxicity in rats.","Abuse of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) is associated with neurological and cognitive problems in athletes. The Purpose of this study was to investigate the simultaneous effect of resistance training (RT) and spirulina supplementation (Sp) on the function of the antioxidant system with emphasis on mir125b, mir146a and cognitive function in Stanazolol (S)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. This experimental animal model study was performed with a post-test design with a control group. 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups of 9 animals including (Althobaiti et al., 2022) [1]: sham (Sh/normal saline intake) (Havnes et al., 2019) [2], 25 mg/kg/wk of stanazolol (S) (Albano et al., 2021) [3], S + 100 mg/kg of Sp + (S + Sp) (Bjørnebekk et al., 2021) [4], RT (six weeks with an intensity of 50-100% of body weight) + S (S + RT) (Kanayama et al., 2013) [5] S + Sp + RT. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), percentage of healthy cells in the C1 and C3 regions of hippocampus, miR125b, miR146a, step-through latency (STL), time spent in dark compartment (TDC), repeated entry in dark compartment (RDC) and percentage of alternation (PA%) were measured in the post-test. Results showed that the Sp, RT and SP + RT increased levels of SOD, GPx and percentage of healthy cells in C1 region, decreased MDA, mir125b, mir146a in hippocampal tissue and decreased TDC levels in S-exposed rats (P ≤ 0.05). Sp + RT decreased RDC and increased SOD levels; on the other hand, RT decreased RDC levels in S-exposed rats (P ≤ 0.05). Levels of TAC in the Sp groups were significantly higher than the S group (P ≤ 0.05). Also, the effect of Sp + RT in reducing miR125b, miR146a, and STL levels was much higher than the effect of Sp and RT alone (P ≤ 0.05). It seems that applying resistance training and spirulina supplementation both separately and interactively is effective in improving the antioxidant system as well as memory and learning in cognitive impairment caused by stanazolol.

79,36017670,"Aging, testosterone, and neuroplasticity: friend or foe?","Neuroplasticity or neural plasticity implicates the adaptive potential of the brain in response to extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli. The concept has been utilized in different contexts such as injury and neurological disease. Neuroplasticity mechanisms have been classified into neuroregenerative and function-restoring processes. In the context of injury, neuroplasticity has been defined in three post-injury epochs. Testosterone plays a key yet double-edged role in the regulation of several neuroplasticity alterations. Research has shown that testosterone levels are affected by numerous factors such as age, stress, surgical procedures on gonads, and pharmacological treatments. There is an ongoing debate for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in aging men; however, TRT is more useful in young individuals with testosterone deficit and more specific subgroups with cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, it is important to pay early attention to testosterone profile and precisely uncover its harms and benefits. In the present review, we discuss the influence of environmental factors, aging, and gender on testosterone-associated alterations in neuroplasticity, as well as the two-sided actions of testosterone in the nervous system. Finally, we provide practical insights for further study of pharmacological treatments for hormonal disorders focusing on restoring neuroplasticity.","['aging', 'central nervous system', 'neuroendocrine disorders', 'neuroplasticity', 'testosterone']",Reviews in the neurosciences,2022-08-27,"[{'lastname': 'Saleki', 'firstname': 'Kiarash', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Student Research Committee, Babol University of Medical Sciences, 47176 47745 Babol, Iran.\nUSERN Office, Babol University of Medical Sciences, 47176 47745 Babol, Iran.\nSystematic Review and Meta-analysis Expert Group (SRMEG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), 14197 33151 Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Banazadeh', 'firstname': 'Mohammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Expert Group (SRMEG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), 14197 33151 Tehran, Iran.\nPharmaceutical Sciences and Cosmetic Products Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, 76169 13555 Kerman, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Saghazadeh', 'firstname': 'Amene', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Expert Group (SRMEG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), 14197 33151 Tehran, Iran.\nResearch Center for Immunodeficiencies, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 14197 33151 Tehran, Iran.""}, {'lastname': 'Rezaei', 'firstname': 'Nima', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Research Center for Immunodeficiencies, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 14197 33151 Tehran, Iran.\nDepartment of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 14176 13151 Tehran, Iran.\nNetwork of Immunity in Infection, Malignancy and Autoimmunity (NIIMA), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), 14197 33151 Tehran, Iran.""}]",,,,"© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","10.1515/revneuro-2022-0033

80,35999482,The medicalization of testosterone: reinventing the elixir of life.,"The pursuit of longevity, which during the Renaissance era was limited to longing for miraculous ways of rejuvenation, such as bathing in the fountain of youth, took a scientific turn in 1889 with the publication of Brown-Sequard's self-experiments with an extract of animal testes, which apparently improved his vitality, physical strength and cognition. This extract, marketed then as the ""Elixir of Life"", was sold for decades throughout Europe and North America. However, recent replication of Brown-Sequard's experiments demonstrated that such an extract only contains homeopathic concentrations of testosterone that are insufficient to exert any biological effect. Thus, the birth of Andrology began with a placebo effect. Over the past few decades, the quest for compounds that might lead to rejuvenation has regained traction, with testosterone being at the forefront. Though clinical practice guidelines advocate testosterone therapy in men with organic hypogonadism-the only indication approved by the Food and Drug Administration-testosterone continues to be marketed as a wonder drug with rejuvenating effects on sexual function, vitality, and a host of other unproven benefits. Additionally, the epidemic of obesity and diabetes, conditions associated with low testosterone, has further brought testosterone into the limelight. Although the number of testosterone prescriptions written have increased several-fold in the past two decades, carefully conducted randomized trials suggest modest benefits of testosterone therapy. At the same time, safety concerns, particularly in older men, remain valid.","['Aging', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Diabetes', 'Obesity']",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2022-08-24,"[{'lastname': 'Gagliano-Jucá', 'firstname': 'Thiago', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Northwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital, Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, McHenry, IL, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Alvarez', 'firstname': 'Mauricio', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Section of Endocrinology, Hospital Militar Central, Bogota, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Basaria', 'firstname': 'Shehzad', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Section On Men's Health, Endocrinology Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 221 Longwood Ave, BLI 541, Boston, MA, 02115, United States. sbasaria@bwh.harvard.edu.""}]",,,,"© 2022.

2605791",Klinefelter syndrome: going beyond the diagnosis.,"Although Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is common, it is rarely recognised in childhood, sometimes being identified with speech or developmental delay or incidental antenatal diagnosis. The only regular feature is testicular dysfunction. Postnatal gonadotropin surge (mini-puberty) may be lower, but treatment with testosterone needs prospective studies. The onset of puberty is at the normal age and biochemical hypogonadism does not typically occur until late puberty. Testosterone supplementation can be considered then or earlier for clinical hypogonadism. The size at birth is normal, but growth acceleration is more rapid in early and mid-childhood, with adult height greater than mid-parental height. Extreme tall stature is unusual. The incidence of adolescent gynaecomastia (35.6%) is not increased compared with typically developing boys and can be reduced or resolved by testosterone supplementation, potentially preventing the need for surgery. Around two-thirds require speech and language therapy or developmental support and early institution of therapy is important. Provision of psychological support may be helpful in ameliorating these experiences and provide opportunities to develop strategies to recognise, process and express feelings and thoughts. Boys with KS are at increased risk of impairment in social cognition and less accurate perceptions of social emotional cues. The concept of likely fertility problems needs introduction alongside regular reviews of puberty and sexual function in adolescents. Although there is now greater success in harvesting sperm through techniques such as testicular sperm extraction, it is more successful in later than in early adolescence. In vitro maturation of germ cells is still experimental.","['child development', 'endocrinology', 'genetics', 'growth', 'mental health']",Archives of disease in childhood,2022-08-11,"[{'lastname': 'Butler', 'firstname': 'Gary', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Paediatric and Adolescent Endocrinology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK gary.butler@ucl.ac.uk.\nUCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Srirangalingam', 'firstname': 'Umasuthan', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Faithfull', 'firstname': 'Jennie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sangster', 'firstname': 'Philippa', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Urology and Andrology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Senniappan', 'firstname': 'Senthil', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Endocrinology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Mitchell', 'firstname': 'Rod', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh Division of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, Edinburgh, UK.\nDepartment of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, UK.'}]",,,,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

82,35944495,Use of High-Dose Androgens Is Associated with Reduced Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Male Weightlifters.,"Use of high-dose androgens causes drastic changes in hormonal milieu and is associated with adverse medical, psychological, and cognitive effects. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors plays a critical role in neuroplasticity, with implications for cognitive function and mental health. The impact of long-term, high-dose androgen use on BDNF in a natural setting has not been investigated. This study examined the association between long-term androgen exposure and BDNF levels, and the links between BDNF, heavy resistance exercise, hormones, androgens, and mental health.
We measured serum levels of BDNF and sex steroid hormones in male weightlifters (N = 141) with a history of current (n = 59), past (n = 29), or no (n = 52) androgen use. All participants completed questionnaires assessing maximum strength and measures of anxiety and depression. Group differences in BDNF were tested using general linear models adjusting for age and associations between BDNF and strength, anxiety, and depression using Pearson's or Kendall's correlations.
Both current (mean: 44.1 ng/mL [SD: 12.7]) and past (39.5 ng/mL [SD: 13.9]) androgen users showed lower serum BDNF levels compared to nonusing controls (51.5 [SD: 15.3], p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.10). BDNF levels were negatively related to maximal strength, and with hormonal status in past androgen users, but no significant associations were found with measures of depression and anxiety.
Lower circulating BDNF concentrations in current and past androgen users suggest that high-dose androgen exposure triggers persistent changes in BDNF expression. Further studies are needed to verify the relationship and its potential clinical implications.","['Anabolic androgenic steroids', 'Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)', 'Heavy resistance training', 'Neurotropic factors', 'Sex hormones']",Neuroendocrinology,2022-08-10,"[{'lastname': 'Bjørnebekk', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Section for Clinical Addiction Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Scarth', 'firstname': 'Morgan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Section for Clinical Addiction Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Neupane', 'firstname': 'Sudan Prasad', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Westlye', 'firstname': 'Lars T', 'initials': 'LT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDivision of Mental Health and Addiction, Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research (NORMENT), Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Hullstein', 'firstname': 'Ingunn R', 'initials': 'IR', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Doping Control Laboratory, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Thorsby', 'firstname': 'Per Medbøe', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biochemical Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Group, Hormone Laboratory, Oslo University Hospital, Aker, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Halvorsen', 'firstname': 'Bente', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,Lower circulating BDNF concentrations in current and past androgen users suggest that high-dose androgen exposure triggers persistent changes in BDNF expression.

15862203",Associations of Bioavailable Serum Testosterone With Cognitive Function in Older Men: Results From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,"Age-associated cognitive decline may be influenced by testosterone status. However, studies evaluating the impact of bioavailable testosterone, the active, free testosterone, on cognitive function are scarce. Our study determined the relationship between calculated bioavailable testosterone and cognitive performance in older men.
We used data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2013 and 2014. This study consisted of 208 men aged ≥60 years. Bioavailable serum testosterone was calculated based on the total serum testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and albumin levels, whereas cognitive performance was assessed through the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List Learning Test (WLLT), Word List Recall Test (WLRT), and Intrusion Word Count Test (WLLT-IC and WLRT-IC), the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed upon adjustment for age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education level, medical history, body mass index, energy, alcohol intake, physical activity levels, and sleep duration.
A significant positive association between bioavailable testosterone and DSST (β: 0.049, p = .002) score was detected, with no signs of a plateau effect. No significant associations with CERAD WLLT (p = .132), WLRT (p = .643), WLLT-IC (p = .979), and WLRT-IC (p = .387), and AFT (p = .057) were observed.
Calculated bioavailable testosterone presented a significant positive association with processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory in older men above 60 years of age. Further research is warranted to elucidate the impact of the inevitable age-related decline in testosterone on cognitive function in older men.","['Aging', 'Bioavailable testosterone', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Older men']","The journals of gerontology.

33632142",Associations between cognitive function and endogenous levels of estradiol and testosterone in adults with type 2 diabetes.,"To assess associations that endogenous estradiol and testosterone levels have with cognitive function in older adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
We use data from the Look AHEAD clinical trial of behavioral weight loss. Endogenous estradiol and total testosterone levels were determined using stored serum from 996 individuals, mean age 69 years, at two times (averaging 4 years apart) during years 8-18 of follow-up. One to four standardized assessments of attention, executive function, memory, and verbal fluency were collected during this follow-up. Mixed effects models and multiple imputation were used to assess associations that estradiol and total testosterone levels had with body mass index and cognitive function.
Estradiol levels were not associated with cognitive function in either sex. Total testosterone levels were not associated with cognitive function in women, but greater total testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency in men (p < 0.001), most strongly among those carrying the APOE-e4 allele (interaction p = 0.02). The weight loss intervention left a legacy of relatively lower cognitive functioning among women, which was not mediated by current levels of sex hormones.
Behavioral weight loss intervention does not affect cognitive functioning through mechanisms related to estradiol or testosterone.

23898179",First Trimester Dexamethasone Treatment Is Not Associated With Alteration in Resting-state Connectivity at Adolescent or Adult Age.,"Prenatal treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) has been used to prevent virilization in females at risk of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Both affected and unaffected girls, as well boys, are treated until the genotype and sex of the fetus is known (gestational weeks 10-12). After that, only affected girls are treated until term. Exposure to a high synthetic glucocorticoid dosage may alter the developmental trajectory of the brain, with alterations in resting-state functional connectivity of the brain at adult age.
To investigate resting-state functional connectivity in subjects at risk of having CAH, exposed to DEX treatment during the first trimester of fetal life, both in the whole brain and in 3 regions of interest (amygdala, hippocampus, and superior frontal gyrus).
Eighteen participants (8 females) at risk of having CAH, exposed to DEX treatment, and 38 controls (24 females), age range 16 to 26 years, from a single research institute, underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain during rest. We used 2 different approaches: an exploratory whole-brain analysis and seed-based analysis. For seed-based analysis, we chose 3 different brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus, and superior frontal gyrus) based on our previous findings and literature evidence.
We did not observe any differences in functional connectivity during rest, either in the whole brain nor in seed-based connectivity analyses at this adolescent and young adult age.
Our results are reassuring; however, future studies on larger samples and with more sensitive methodologies are needed to confirm these findings.","['brain function', 'cognition', 'dexamethasone', 'prenatal treatment', 'resting state']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2022-07-27,"[{'lastname': 'Messina', 'firstname': 'Valeria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit (QB83), Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': ""Van't Westeinde"", 'firstname': 'Annelies', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit (QB83), Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Padilla', 'firstname': 'Nelly', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska vägen 8 (S3:03), Karolinska University Hospital, SE- 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Lajic', 'firstname': 'Svetlana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit (QB83), Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""}]",,,"We did not observe any differences in functional connectivity during rest, either in the whole brain nor in seed-based connectivity analyses at this adolescent and young adult age.",© The Author(s) 2022.

33946474","Age-related neuroendocrine, cognitive, and behavioral co-morbidities are promoted by HIV-1 Tat expression in male mice.","In the U.S. about half of the HIV-infected individuals are aged 50 and older. In men living with HIV, secondary hypogonadism is common and occurs earlier than in seronegative men, and its prevalence increases with age. While the mechanisms(s) are unknown, the HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein disrupts neuroendocrine function in mice partly by dysregulating mitochondria and neurosteroidogenesis. We hypothesized that conditional Tat expression in middle-aged male transgenic mice [Tat(+)] would promote age-related comorbidities compared to age-matched controls [Tat(-)]. We expected Tat to alter steroid hormone milieu consistent with behavioral deficits. Middle-aged Tat(+) mice had lower circulating testosterone and progesterone than age-matched controls and greater circulating corticosterone and central allopregnanolone than other groups. Young Tat(+) mice had greater circulating progesterone and estradiol-to-testosterone ratios. Older age or Tat exposure increased anxiety-like behavior (open field; elevated plus-maze), increased cognitive errors (radial arm water maze), and reduced grip strength. Young Tat(+), or middle-aged Tat(-), males had higher mechanical nociceptive thresholds than age-matched counterparts. Steroid levels correlated with behaviors. Thus, Tat may contribute to HIV-accelerated aging.","['aging', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis', 'secondary hypogonadism', 'trans-activating transcriptor']",Aging,2022-07-14,"[{'lastname': 'Qrareya', 'firstname': 'Alaa N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'Department of BioMolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahdi', 'firstname': 'Fakhri', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of BioMolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaufman', 'firstname': 'Marc J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, McLean Imaging Center, McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Belmont, MA 02478, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ashpole', 'firstname': 'Nicole M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': 'Department of BioMolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.\nResearch Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Paris', 'firstname': 'Jason J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of BioMolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.\nResearch Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.18632/aging.204166

27369327",Increased cytokine gene expression and cognition risk associated with androgen deprivation therapy.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard treatment modality for locally advanced, high-risk, and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Long-term ADT treatment likely develops side-effects that include changes in cognition or onset of dementia. However, the molecular understanding of this effect remains elusive. We attempt to establish a link between ADT and changes in cognitive function using patient databases and bioinformatics analyses.
Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA sequencing data from Alzheimer patient cohort and compared with the data from advanced-stage prostate cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant antiandrogen therapy. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the Ingenuity knowledge database.
A total of 1952 DEGs in the Alzheimer patient cohort and 101 DEGs were identified in ADT treated prostate cancer patients. Comparing both data sets provided a subset of 33 commonly expressed genes involving cytokine-cytokine signaling with an over representation of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, inflammatory cytokines, signaling by interleukins together with alterations in the circulating lymphocyte repertoire, adaptive immune responses, regulation of cytokine production, and changes in T-cell subsets. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor, and toll-like receptors were identified as upstream transcriptional regulators of these pathways. The most commonly expressed genes viz. IL-17A, CCL2, IL-10, IL-6, IL-1RN, LIF/LIFR were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR exhibited higher expression in antiandrogen treated neuronal, glial, and androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells, compared to no-androgen antagonist treatment.
Our findings suggest that changes in cytokine signaling under the influence of ADT in prostate cancer patients may be linked with cognitive impairment presenting new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic development in combating brain deficits.","['androgen deprivation therapy', 'antiandrogens', 'brain deficits', 'cognitive impairment', 'proinflammatory cytokines', 'prostate cancer']",The Prostate,2022-07-14,"[{'lastname': 'Verma', 'firstname': 'Shiv', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nThe Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kushwaha', 'firstname': 'Prem Prakash', 'initials': 'PP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nThe Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shankar', 'firstname': 'Eswar', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nThe Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ponsky', 'firstname': 'Lee E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nThe Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Sanjay', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nThe Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Nutrition, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDivision of General Medical Sciences, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Urology, Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}]",,,"A total of 1952 DEGs in the Alzheimer patient cohort and 101 DEGs were identified in ADT treated prostate cancer patients.

12439088",Effects of Four Weeks of Beta-Alanine Supplementation Combined with One Week of Creatine Loading on Physical and Cognitive Performance in Military Personnel.,"The purpose was to investigate the effects of a 7-day creatine (Cr) loading protocol at the end of four weeks of β-alanine supplementation (BA) on physical performance, blood lactate, cognitive performance, and resting hormonal concentrations compared to BA alone. Twenty male military personnel (age: 21.5 ± 1.5 yrs; height: 1.78 ± 0.05 m; body mass: 78.5 ± 7.0 kg; BMI: 23.7 ± 1.64 kg/m2) were recruited and randomized into two groups: BA + Cr or BA + placebo (PL). Participants in each group (n = 10 per group) were supplemented with 6.4 g/day of BA for 28 days. After the third week, the BA + Cr group participants were also supplemented with Cr (0.3 g/kg/day), while the BA + PL group ingested an isocaloric placebo for 7 days. Before and after supplementation, each participant performed a battery of physical and cognitive tests and provided a venous blood sample to determine resting testosterone, cortisol, and IGF-1. Furthermore, immediately after the last physical test, blood lactate was assessed. There was a significant improvement in physical performance and mathematical processing in the BA + Cr group over time (p < 0.05), while there was no change in the BA + PL group. Vertical jump performance and testosterone were significantly higher in the BA + Cr group compared to BA + PL. These results indicate that Cr loading during the final week of BA supplementation (28 days) enhanced muscular power and appears to be superior for muscular strength and cognitive performance compared to BA supplementation alone.","['anerobic performance', 'cognitive function', 'cortisol', 'lactate', 'strength', 'testosterone']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Samadi', 'firstname': 'Mohammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Exercise Physiology Research Center, Lifestyle Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6437, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Askarian', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Exercise Physiology Research Center, Lifestyle Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6437, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Shirvani', 'firstname': 'Hossein', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Exercise Physiology Research Center, Lifestyle Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6437, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Shamsoddini', 'firstname': 'Alireza', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Exercise Physiology Research Center, Lifestyle Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6437, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Shakibaee', 'firstname': 'Abolfazl', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Exercise Physiology Research Center, Lifestyle Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6437, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Forbes', 'firstname': 'Scott C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Education, Department of Physical Education Studies, Brandon University, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaviani', 'firstname': 'Mojtaba', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Pure and Applied Science, Acadia University, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph19137992

26521052",Hormonal Profile in Response to an Empathic Induction Task in Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence: Oxytocin/Testosterone Ratio and Social Cognition.,"Empathy deficits have been proposed to be an important factor for intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV perpetrators have shown a differential change in salivary oxytocin (sOXT), testosterone (sT), and cortisol (sC), following empathic and stress tasks, compared to non-violent men. However, the influence of empathic deficits in those hormones after an emotion-induction task in IPV perpetrators remains unclear. We analyzed the effects of an empathic induction task on endogenous sOXT, sT and sC levels, as well as their hormonal ratios, in IPV perpetrators (","['emotion induction', 'empathy', 'oxytocin', 'oxytocin–testosterone ratio', 'perspective taking', 'testosterone–cortisol ratio']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Comes-Fayos', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Romero-Martínez', 'firstname': 'Ángel', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez Moreno', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Blanco-Gandía', 'firstname': 'María Carmen', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Sociology, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Arias', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Lila', 'firstname': 'Marisol', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Psychology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Blasco-Ros', 'firstname': 'Concepción', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Bressanutti', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Moya-Albiol', 'firstname': 'Luis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Sociology, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph19137897

32895712","Association of age, hormonal, and lifestyle factors with the Leydig cell biomarker INSL3 in aging men from the European Male Aging Study cohort.","Aging in men is accompanied by a broad range of symptoms, including sexual dysfunction, cognitive and musculoskeletal decline, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, organ degeneration/failure, and increasing neoplasia, some of which are associated with declining levels of Leydig cell-produced testosterone. High natural biological variance, together with multiple factors that can modulate circulating testosterone concentration, may influence its interpretation and clinical implications. Insulin-like peptide 3 is a biomarker of Leydig cell function that might provide complementary information on testicular health and its downstream outcomes.
To characterize insulin-like peptide 3 as a biomarker to assess gonadal status in aging men.
A large European multicenter (European Male Aging Study) cohort of community-dwelling men was analyzed to determine how insulin-like peptide 3 relates to a range of hormonal, anthropometric, and lifestyle parameters.
Insulin-like peptide 3 declines cross-sectionally and longitudinally within individuals at approximately 15% per decade from age 40 years, unlike testosterone (1.9% per decade), which is partly compensated by increasing pituitary luteinizing hormone production. Importantly, lower insulin-like peptide 3 in younger men appears to persist with aging. Multiple regression analysis shows that, unlike testosterone, insulin-like peptide 3 is negatively dependent on luteinizing hormone and sex hormone-binding globulin and positively dependent on follicle-stimulating hormone, suggesting a different mechanism of gonadotropic regulation. Circulating insulin-like peptide 3 is negatively associated with increased body mass index or waist circumference and with smoking, and unlike testosterone, it is not affected by weight loss in obese individuals. Geographic variation in mean insulin-like peptide 3 within Europe appears to be largely explained by differences in these parameters. The results allowed the establishment of a European-wide reference range for insulin-like peptide 3 (95% confidence interval) adjusted for increasing age.
Insulin-like peptide 3 is a constitutive biomarker of Leydig cell functional capacity and is a robust, reliably measurable peptide not subject to gonadotropin-dependent short-term regulation and within-individual variation in testosterone.","['HPG axis', 'INSL3', 'Leydig cell', 'aging male', 'hypogonadism', 'testosterone']",Andrology,2022-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Anand-Ivell', 'firstname': 'Ravinder', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Heng', 'firstname': 'Kee', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Severn', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Mathematics, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Antonio', 'firstname': 'Leen', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology, KU Leuven, Belgium.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Bartfai', 'firstname': 'Gyorgy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Andrology, Albert Szent-Gyorgy Medical University, Szeged, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Casanueva', 'firstname': 'Felipe F', 'initials': 'FF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Santiago de Compostela University, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago (CHUS), CIBER de Fisiopatología Obesidad y Nutricion (CB06/03), Instituto Salud Carlos III, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Huhtaniemi', 'firstname': 'Ilpo T', 'initials': 'IT', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Reproductive and Developmental, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Giwercman', 'firstname': 'Aleksander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Maggi', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology Unit, ""Mario Serio"" Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Neill"", 'firstname': 'Terence W', 'initials': 'TW', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Epidemiology Versus Arthritis, The University of Manchester & NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Punab', 'firstname': 'Margus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Andrology Unit, United Laboratories of Tartu University Clinics, Tartu, Estonia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rastrelli', 'firstname': 'Giulia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology Unit, ""Mario Serio"" Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Slowikowska-Hilczer', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Andrology and Reproductive Endocrinology, Medical University of Łódź, Łódź, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Tournoy', 'firstname': 'Jos', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Vanderschueren', 'firstname': 'Dirk', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology, KU Leuven, Belgium.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Frederick C W', 'initials': 'FCW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivell', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, UK.'}]",,"Insulin-like peptide 3 is a constitutive biomarker of Leydig cell functional capacity and is a robust, reliably measurable peptide not subject to gonadotropin-dependent short-term regulation and within-individual variation in testosterone.",,© 2022 The Authors.

91,35753445,Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid exposure altered hypothalamic metabolism and disturbed male fecundity.,"Previous studies have examined the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) on disruption of the blood-testis barrier and spermatogenesis. Sertoli and Leydig cells were perturbed, resulting in a decrease in testosterone levels and sperm counts. However, the effects of PFOS on male fecundity are not limited to the testes. In this study, we demonstrated that oral PFOS exposure (1 μg/g BW and 5 μg/g BW) decreased the function of the Luteinizing hormone (LH)/Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHr) and decreased epididymal sperm motility. Consistently, testicular transcriptome analysis revealed that PFOS altered the expression of a cluster of genes associated with sperm motility and steroidogenesis. In mice exposed to PFOS, c-Fos immunostaining showed activation of the lateral septal nucleus (LS), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), locus coeruleus (LC), which are known to be related to anxiety-like behaviors. Metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus revealed that exposure to PFOS perturbed the translation of proteins, as well as the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Altogether, the activation of brain nuclei, shift of hypothalamic metabolome, and reduction of LH/LHr circuit resulted from PFOS exposure suggested the toxicant's systematic effects on male reproduction.","['Hypothalamus', 'Locus coeruleus', 'Metabolome', 'PFOS', 'Transcriptome']",The Science of the total environment,2022-06-27,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Zijie', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Croucher Institute for Environmental Sciences, Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China; The Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518000, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Ziyi', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'The Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518000, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ji', 'firstname': 'Shuqin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518000, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Keng-Po', 'initials': 'KP', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Integrative Omics, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Microenvironmental Regulation, Guilin Medical University, Guilin 530022, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wan', 'firstname': 'Hin-Ting', 'initials': 'HT', 'affiliation': 'Croucher Institute for Environmental Sciences, Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Chris Kong Chu', 'initials': 'CKC', 'affiliation': 'Croucher Institute for Environmental Sciences, Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China.

33005116","Putative Mental, Physical, and Social Mechanisms of Hormonal Influences on Postpartum Sexuality.","Much research has documented changes in postpartum sexuality, including changes in sexual functioning and satisfaction for both the birthing parent and their partner(s). These changes are often linked to postpartum changes in hormonal and immune responses, which can have both direct and indirect effects on sexuality.
Here, we review how postpartum sexuality may be changed via mental, physical, and social/relationship effects of a variety of hormones, including estrogens, progestogens, androgens, cortisol, and oxytocin. We also review the ways in which inflammation may act alongside hormones to influence postpartum sexuality.
We argue that, as each of these factors strongly influence the action of others, the next phase of research in postpartum sexuality must examine the bidirectional interactions of hormones and their effects on behavior, cognition, and social relationships.","['Endocrine', 'Immune', 'Peripartum', 'Postpartum', 'Sexual function', 'Sexuality']",Current sexual health reports,2022-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Clephane', 'firstname': 'Kirstin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology & Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Stadium East C69, Lincoln, NE 68588-0156, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lorenz', 'firstname': 'Tierney K', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology & Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Stadium East C69, Lincoln, NE 68588-0156, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1007/s11930-021-00321-8

28331554",Hypothalamic connectivities predict individual differences in ADT-elicited changes in working memory and quality of life in prostate cancer patients.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been associated with adverse effects on cognition. However, we currently lack understanding of the neurobiology and prognostic markers of these effects. Given that ADT acts via the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, we assessed whether baseline hypothalamic resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) could predict changes in working memory and quality of life in prostate cancer patients following androgen deprivation. In a prospective observational study, 28 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT and 38 patients not receiving ADT (controls), matched in age, years of education and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, participated in brain imaging at baseline, and N-back task and quality-of-life (QoL) assessments at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Imaging data were processed with published routines and evaluated at a corrected threshold. ADT and control groups did not differ in N-back performance or QoL across time points. In ADT, the changes in 0-back correct response rate (follow-up-baseline) were correlated with baseline hypothalamus-precentral gyrus rsFC; the changes in 1-back correct response rate and reaction time were each correlated with hypothalamus-middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule rsFC. The changes in physical well-being subscore of QoL were correlated with baseline hypothalamus-anterior cingulate and cuneus rsFC. The hypothalamus rsFCs predicted N-back and QoL change with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 and 0.73, respectively. Baseline hypothalamus-frontoparietal and salience network rsFC's predict inter-subject variations in the changes in working-memory and QoL following 6 months of ADT. Whether and how hypothalamic rsFCs may predict the cognitive and QoL effects with longer-term ADT remain to be investigated.",[],Scientific reports,2022-06-11,"[{'lastname': 'Chaudhary', 'firstname': 'Shefali', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, CMHC S110, 34 Park Street, New Haven, CT, 06519, USA. shefali.chaudhary@yale.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'Alicia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Center, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, 950 Campbell Avenue, West Haven, CT, 06516, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Summers', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Center, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, 950 Campbell Avenue, West Haven, CT, 06516, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhornitsky', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, CMHC S110, 34 Park Street, New Haven, CT, 06519, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahles', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Chiang-Shan R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.\nInterdepartmental Neuroscience Program, Yale University School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.\nWu Tsai Institute, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Herta H', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Center, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, 950 Campbell Avenue, West Haven, CT, 06516, USA. herta.chao@yale.edu.\nDepartment of Medicine and Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06519, USA. herta.chao@yale.edu.'}]",,,,© 2022.

29128813",Androgens Enhance Recognition Memory and Dendritic Spine Density in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex of Ovariectomized Female Rats.,"Estrogen replacement has been repeatedly shown to enhance memory and increase dendritic spine density in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. Given the potential deleterious effects of chronic estrogen administration, the present study assessed cognitive function using recognition memory tasks and measured dendritic spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex after subchronic androgen replacement to adult OVX female rats. All androgens enhanced recognition memory in OVX rats, but object placement (OP) and object recognition (OR) results differed. Only testosterone enhanced OR. Testosterone had no effect on OP while dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione (AD) enhanced OP. Dendritic spine density was increased by both TP and DHEA in both brain areas (DHT and AD were not tested). Lastly, we used the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, to discriminate between potential androgenic and estrogenic effects of androgens on behavior. Letrozole alone did not alter recognition memory in OVX rats and did not block the effects of either TP or DHEA on recognition memory suggesting that effects were mediated via androgenic mechanisms. The present results expand previous information on gonadal hormone actions and show that, in addition to estrogens, androgens also improve memory and increase spine density in brains of OVX female rats. While requiring further investigation, these observations provide a basis for therapeutic interventions in the treatment of menopausal, age or disease related memory loss.","['androgens', 'dendritic spines', 'hippocampus', 'memory', 'neural plasticity', 'prefrontal cortex', 'testosterone']",Neuroscience,2022-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Luine', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Hunter College, 695 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10065, United States.

34871580","Testosterone, cognitive decline and dementia in ageing men.","As men grow older, circulating testosterone concentrations decline, while prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia increase. Epidemiological studies of middle-aged and older men have demonstrated associations of lower testosterone concentrations with higher prevalence and incidence of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. In observational studies, men with prostate cancer treated by androgen deprivation therapy had a higher risk of dementia. Small intervention studies of testosterone using different measures of cognitive function have provided inconsistent results, with some suggesting improvement. A randomised placebo-controlled trial of one year's testosterone treatment conducted in 788 men aged ≥ 65 years, baseline testosterone < 9.54 nmol/L, showed an improvement in sexual function, but no improvement in cognitive function. There is a known association between diabetes and dementia risk. A randomised placebo-controlled trial of two year's testosterone treatment in 1,007 men aged 50-74 years, waist circumference ≥ 95 cm, baseline testosterone ≤ 14 nmol/L, showed an effect of testosterone in reducing type 2 diabetes risk. There were no cognitive endpoints in that trial. Additional research is warranted but at this stage lower testosterone concentrations in ageing men should be regarded as a biomarker rather than a proven therapeutic target for risk reduction of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Male ageing', 'Sex hormone-binding globulin', 'Testosterone']",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2022-05-29,"[{'lastname': 'Yeap', 'firstname': 'Bu B', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. bu.yeap@uwa.edu.au.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth, Australia. bu.yeap@uwa.edu.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Flicker', 'firstname': 'Leon', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.\nWestern Australian Centre for Health and Ageing, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.'}]",,,,© 2022.

19804754",Sex Differences in Social Cognition.,"In this review we explore the sex differences underlying various types of social cognition. Particular focus will be placed on the behaviors of social recognition, social learning, and aggression. Known similarities and differences between sexes in the expressions of these behaviors and the known brain regions where these behaviors are mediated are discussed. The role that the sex hormones (estrogens and androgens) have as well as possible interactions with other neurochemicals, such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and serotonin is reviewed as well. Finally, implications about these findings on the mediation of social cognition are mediated and the sex differences related to humans are considered.","['Aggression', 'Androgens', 'Estrogens', 'Social Learning', 'Social Recognition']",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2022-05-24,"[{'lastname': 'Paletta', 'firstname': 'Pietro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bass', 'firstname': 'Noah', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Aspesi', 'firstname': 'Dario', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Choleris', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Program, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. echoleri@uoguelph.ca.'}]",,,,"© 2022.

31600481",Testosterone Deficiency in Sickle Cell Disease: Recognition and Remediation.,"Hypogonadism is common in men with sickle cell disease (SCD) with prevalence rates as high as 25%. Testicular failure (primary hypogonadism) is established as the principal cause for this hormonal abnormality, although secondary hypogonadism and compensated hypogonadism have also been observed. The underlying mechanism for primary hypogonadism was elucidated in a mouse model of SCD, and involves increased NADPH oxidase-derived oxidative stress in the testis, which reduces protein expression of a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and cholesterol transport to the mitochondria in Leydig cells. In all men including those with SCD, hypogonadism affects physical growth and development, cognition and mental health, sexual function, as well as fertility. However, it is not understood whether declines in physical, psychological, and social domains of health in SCD patients are related to low testosterone, or are consequences of other abnormalities of SCD. Priapism is one of only a few complications of SCD that has been studied in the context of hypogonadism. In this pathologic condition of prolonged penile erection in the absence of sexual excitement or stimulation, hypogonadism exacerbates already impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase/cGMP/phosphodiesterase-5 molecular signaling in the penis. While exogenous testosterone alleviates priapism, it disadvantageously decreases intratesticular testosterone production. In contrast to treatment with exogenous testosterone, a novel approach is to target the mechanisms of testosterone deficiency in the SCD testis to drive endogenous testosterone production, which potentially decreases further oxidative stress and damage in the testis, and preserves sperm quality. Stimulation of translocator protein within the transduceosome of the testis of SCD mice reverses both hypogonadism and priapism, without affecting intratesticular testosterone production and consequently fertility. Ongoing research is needed to define and develop therapies that restore endogenous testosterone production in a physiologic, mechanism-specific fashion without affecting fertility in SCD men.","['PDE5', 'TSPO', 'erectile dysfunction', 'infertility', 'nitric oxide', 'oxidative stress', 'testosterone replacement']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-05-21,"[{'lastname': 'Musicki', 'firstname': 'Biljana', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Burnett', 'firstname': 'Arthur L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2022 Musicki and Burnett.,"10.3389/fendo.2022.892184

98,35583989,Androgen synthesis inhibition increases behavioural flexibility and mPFC tyrosine hydroxylase in gonadectomized male rats.,"Behavioural flexibility is essential to adapt to a changing environment and depends on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Testosterone administration decreases behavioural flexibility. It is well known that testosterone is produced in the gonads, but testosterone is also produced in the brain, including the mPFC and other nodes of the mesocorticolimbic system. It is unclear how testosterone produced in the brain versus the gonads influences behavioural flexibility. Here, in adult male rats, we assessed the effects of the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate (ABI) and long-term gonadectomy (GDX) on behavioural flexibility in two paradigms. In Experiment 1, ABI but not GDX reduced the number of errors to criterion and perseverative errors in a strategy set-shifting task. In Experiment 2, with a separate cohort of rats, ABI but not GDX reduced perseverative errors in a reversal learning task. In Experiment 1, we also examined tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir), and ABI but not GDX increased TH-ir in the mPFC. Our findings suggest that neurally-produced androgens modulate behavioural flexibility via modification of dopamine signalling in the mesocorticolimbic system. These results indicate that neurosteroids regulate executive functions and that ABI treatment for prostate cancer might affect cognition.","['CYP17A1', 'dopamine', 'neurosteroids', 'set-shifting', 'testosterone']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2022-05-19,"[{'lastname': 'Tomm', 'firstname': 'Ryan J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Seib', 'firstname': 'Désirée R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kachkovski', 'firstname': 'George V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Schweitzer', 'firstname': 'Helen R', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tobiansky', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Floresco', 'firstname': 'Stan B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Soma', 'firstname': 'Kiran K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}]",,,,© 2022 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/jne.13128,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df3eda40>,,,,,,
99,35512479,Cortisol and testosterone concentrations during the prenatal and postpartum period forecast later caregiving quality in mothers and fathers.,"Given that parental caregiving quality affects child development from birth onwards, it is important to detect parents who are at risk for low-quality caregiving as early as possible, preferably before or soon after birth. This study investigated whether cortisol (CORT) and testosterone (T) measured during the last trimester of pregnancy and six weeks postpartum were associated with observed caregiving quality at child age 3 in mothers (N = 63) and fathers (N = 45). CORT and T were measured during an interaction with a simulator infant (pregnancy) and their own infant (postpartum). In mothers, no associations were found with CORT and T during pregnancy, but higher postpartum CORT during a mother-infant interaction was related to higher caregiving quality during toddlerhood. In fathers, the association between T during pregnancy and caregiving quality in toddlerhood was more negative for fathers with low CORT. In contrast to mothers, higher postpartum CORT in fathers was associated with lower caregiving quality in toddlerhood. These findings proved robust after applying the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control for false discovery rate. Our findings indicate that CORT and T during the perinatal period can forecast caregiving quality in both mothers and fathers. Moreover, our results provided evidence for the dual-hormone hypothesis, but only in fathers. These findings contribute to our growing understanding on how endocrine measures explain individual differences in caregiving quality in mothers and fathers.","['Caregiving quality', 'Cortisol', 'Postnatal', 'Prenatal', 'Testosterone', 'Toddlerhood']",Hormones and behavior,2022-05-06,"[{'lastname': 'Beijers', 'firstname': 'Roseriet', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Development, Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, the Netherlands; Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands.

27583806",Androgen deprivation therapy and risk of cognitive dysfunction in men with prostate cancer: is there a possible link?,"The expansion of the indication to use androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to treat patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer has dramatically increased over the recent decades, resulting in the progress of patients' survival. However, chronic health implications can become more apparent as the number of long-term cancer survivors is expected to be increased along with the adverse effect of ADT. In particular, interest in investigating ADT, especially luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist association with cognitive dysfunction has been growing. Previous studies in animals and humans suggest that the level of androgen decreases with age and that cognitive decline occurs with decreases in androgen. Correspondingly, some of the extensive studies using common neurocognitive tests have shown that LHRH agonists may affect specific domains of cognitive function (e.g., visuospatial abilities and executive function). However, the results from these studies have not consistently demonstrated the association because of its intrinsic limitations. Large-scale studies based on electronic databases have also failed to show consistent results to make decisive conclusions because of its heterogeneity, complexity of covariates, and possible risk of biases. Thus, this review article summarizes key findings and discusses the results of several studies investigating the ADT association with cognitive dysfunction and risk of dementia from various perspectives.","[""AD, Alzheimer's disease"", 'ADT, androgen deprivation therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Androgen deprivation', 'Cognitive dysfunction', 'DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone', 'DHEAS, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate', 'DHT, dihydrotestosterone', 'Dementia', 'HR, hazard ratio', 'LHRH, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone', 'NHIS, National Health Insurance Service', 'PCa, Prostate cancer', 'Prostate cancer', 'SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin']",Prostate international,2022-05-06,"[{'lastname': 'Shim', 'firstname': 'Myungsun', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Bang', 'firstname': 'Woo Jin', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Oh', 'firstname': 'Cheol Young', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Yong Seong', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Jin Seon', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}]",,,,© 2022 Asian Pacific Prostate Society.

Observational.
Among 1,520 participants with military combatexposure, we measured randomly timed serum levels of insulin-likegrowth factor-1, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and total testosterone as a preliminary NED screen. Using multivariable models, we analyzed relation of screen results in mTBI group membership and post-concussiveclinical features (fatigue, depression, cognitive symptoms, executive function, processing speed).
None of the mTBI positive groups, including repetitive (≥3 mTBI) and blast-related,differed from the non-TBIcontrols on rates of abnormal lab screen or rates of growth hormone deficiency (GHD), hypothyroidism or male hypogonadism in treatment records. Lab screen findings were also not associated with any clinical feature.
This study shows no evidence that remote mTBI(s) or implicated post-concussiveclinical features are linked to GHD, hypothyroidism or male hypogonadism. Large case-controlstudies incorporating more definitive neuroendocrine disorder NED testing (TSH plus thyroxine, early morning testosterone, LH, FSH, prolactin and GH provocative testing) are needed to determine whether mTBI(s) alone elevate one's risk for chronic NED and how best to select patients for comprehensive testing.","['Mild traumatic brain injury', 'growth hormone deficiency', 'hypogonadism', 'hypothyroidism', 'military', 'neuroendocrine', 'service members']",Brain injury,2022-05-05,"[{'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'William C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R), Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Werner', 'firstname': 'Jk', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Agyemang', 'firstname': 'Aa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R), Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Allen', 'firstname': 'Cm', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Resch', 'firstname': 'Je', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Troyanskaya', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Ben Taub Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kenney', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.\nNational Intrepid Center of Excellence, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.'}]",,,"None of the mTBI positive groups, including repetitive (≥3 mTBI) and blast-related,differed from the non-TBIcontrols on rates of abnormal lab screen or rates of growth hormone deficiency (GHD), hypothyroidism or male hypogonadism in treatment records.

102,35487276,"Reproductive hormone levels, androgen receptor CAG repeat length and their longitudinal relationships with decline in cognitive subdomains in men: The European Male Ageing Study.","It has been proposed that endogenous sex hormone levels may present a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. However, the evidence for effects of sex steroids on cognitive ageing is conflicting. We therefore investigated associations between endogenous hormone levels, androgen receptor CAG repeat length, and cognitive domains including visuoconstructional abilities, visual memory, and processing speed in a large-scale longitudinal study of middle-aged and older men.
Men aged 40-79 years from the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS) underwent cognitive assessments and measurements of hormone levels at baseline and follow-up (mean = 4.4 years, SD ± 0.3 years). Hormone levels measured included total and calculated free testosterone and estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and sex hormone-binding globulin. Cognitive function was assessed using the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy and Recall, the Camden Topographical Recognition Memory and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Multivariate linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline and change hormone levels, androgen receptor CAG repeat length, and cognitive decline.
Statistical analyses included 1,827 and 1,423 participants for models investigating relationships of cognition with hormone levels and CAG repeat length, respectively. In age-adjusted models, we found a significant association of higher baseline free testosterone (β=-0.001, p=0.005) and dihydrotestosterone levels (β=-0.065, p=0.003) with greater decline on Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Recall over time. However, these effects were no longer significant following adjustment for centre, health, and lifestyle factors. No relationships were observed between any other baseline hormone levels, change in hormone levels, or androgen receptor CAG repeat length with cognitive decline in the measured domains.
In this large-scale prospective study there was no evidence for an association between endogenous sex hormone levels or CAG repeat length and cognitive ageing in men. These data suggest that sex steroid levels do not affect visuospatial function, visual memory, or processing speed in middle-aged and older men.","['Aging', 'Androgens', 'Cognition', 'Hormones', 'Men']",Physiology & behavior,2022-04-30,"[{'lastname': 'Overman', 'firstname': 'Margot J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Gerontology and Geriatrics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Pendleton', 'firstname': 'Neil', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Clinical & Cognitive Neurosciences, Institute of Brain, Behaviour and Mental Health, The University of Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Neill"", 'firstname': 'Terence W', 'initials': 'TW', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Epidemiology Versus Arthritis, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bartfai', 'firstname': 'Gyorgy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Andrology, Albert Szent-György Medical University, Szeged, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Casanueva', 'firstname': 'Felipe F', 'initials': 'FF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Santiago de Compostela University Spain; CIBEROBN Instituto de Salud Carlos III.

23909073",Androgen Deprivation and Sleep Disturbance: A Mixed Methods Pilot Study of Remote Assessment and Intervention.,"Men receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PC) are at risk for cardiovascular comorbidities and cognitive changes. Interventional research involves in-person assessment of physical fitness/activity and cognitive function, which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Androgen deprivation therapy-related hot flashes and nocturia increase risk for insomnia. Insomnia is associated with fatigue and may exacerbate ADT-related cognitive changes.
The purpose of this mixed-methods pilot was to (1) determine feasibility/acceptability of remotely assessing physical fitness/activity, cognitive function, and sleep; (2) deliver telehealth cognitive behavioral training for insomnia (teleCBT-I) to improve sleep; and (3) garner qualitative feedback to refine remote procedures and teleCBT-I content.
Fifteen men with PC receiving ADT completed a 4-week teleCBT-I intervention. Videoconferencing was used to complete study assessments and deliver the weekly teleCBT-I intervention.
Self-report of sleep quality improved ( P < .001) as did hot flash frequency ( P = .04) and bother ( P = .025). Minimal clinically important differences were detected for changes in insomnia severity and sleep quality. All sleep logs indicated improvement in sleep efficiency. Remote assessment of fitness/cognitive function was demonstrated for 100% of participants. Sufficient actigraph wear time allowed physical activity/sleep assessment for 80%. Sleep actigraphy did not demonstrate significant changes.
Remote monitoring and teleCBT-I are feasible/acceptable to men with PC on ADT. Further research to confirm teleCBT-I efficacy is warranted in this population.
Preliminary efficacy for teleCBT-I interventions was demonstrated.

This study compared the effect of a 20 min game-based exercise with different intensities on hormonal responses and potential links to cognitive performance.
37 adolescents (24 girls and 13 boys; 15-16 years of age) were randomly assigned into light intensity (LIG; 58.64% HR
Repeated-measure ANOVA revealed that neither light nor vigorous game-based exercise acutely affects Testosterone, while Cortisol was higher in the VIG, 20 min after the intervention compared to the LIG and CON. Furthermore, changes in Testosterone were negatively associated with changes in cognitive performance after the acute vigorous intensity exercise (r = -0.63, p = .039) and control condition (r = -0.78, p = .003), but positively associated with post-intervention cognitive performance after the acute light intensity exercise (r = 0.67, p = .012).
The intensity of game-based exercise affected Cortisol concentration in adolescents, while Testosterone concentration did not change after the intervention.

27075850","Oral Contraceptives Modulate the Relationship Between Resting Brain Activity, Amygdala Connectivity and Emotion Recognition - A Resting State fMRI Study.","Recent research into the effects of hormonal contraceptives on emotion processing and brain function suggests that hormonal contraceptive users show (a) reduced accuracy in recognizing emotions compared to naturally cycling women, and (b) alterations in amygdala volume and connectivity at rest. To date, these observations have not been linked, although the amygdala has certainly been identified as core region activated during emotion recognition. To assess, whether volume, oscillatory activity and connectivity of emotion-related brain areas at rest are predictive of participant's ability to recognize facial emotional expressions, 72 participants (20 men, 20 naturally cycling women, 16 users of androgenic contraceptives, 16 users of anti-androgenic contraceptives) completed a brain structural and resting state fMRI scan, as well as an emotion recognition task. Our results showed that resting brain characteristics did not mediate oral contraceptive effects on emotion recognition performance. However, sex and oral contraceptive use emerged as a moderator of brain-behavior associations. Sex differences did emerge in the prediction of emotion recognition performance by the left amygdala amplitude of low frequency oscillations (ALFF) for anger, as well as left and right amygdala connectivity for fear. Anti-androgenic oral contraceptive users (OC) users stood out in that they showed strong brain-behavior associations, usually in the opposite direction as naturally cycling women, while androgenic OC-users showed a pattern similar to, but weaker, than naturally cycling women. This result suggests that amygdala ALFF and connectivity have predictive values for facial emotion recognition. The importance of the different connections depends heavily on sex hormones and oral contraceptive use.","['ALFF', 'amygdala', 'brain connectivity', 'emotion recognition', 'hormonal contraceptives', 'limbic system', 'progestins', 'resting state fMRI']",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2022-04-05,"[{'lastname': 'Menting-Henry', 'firstname': 'Shanice', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hidalgo-Lopez', 'firstname': 'Esmeralda', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Aichhorn', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kronbichler', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\nNeuroscience Institute, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kerschbaum', 'firstname': 'Hubert', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\nDepartment of Biosciences, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Pletzer', 'firstname': 'Belinda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Menting-Henry, Hidalgo-Lopez, Aichhorn, Kronbichler, Kerschbaum and Pletzer.","10.3389/fnbeh.2022.775796

106,35340131,Catch-up fat in male adults induces low testosterone and consequently promotes metabolic abnormalities and cognitive impairment.,"Catch-up fat in adults (CUFA) caused by rapid nutrition promotion after undernutrition plays an important role in the epidemic of insulin resistance (IR)-related diseases in developing societies. Insulin resistance is considered to be closely associated with reduced testosterone levels and cognitive function. However, the effects of CUFA on testosterone levels and cognitive function are unclear in males.
To investigate the changes in testosterone levels and cognitive function in CUFA in male humans and rats, and explore their probable relationship and mechanisms in rats.
The blood testosterone levels, fasting glucose, and blood insulin (FINS) were measured in subpopulation 1 (27 CUFA individuals, 61 controls without CUFA) aged 40-50 years to show the characteristics of sex hormone levels and the metabolic status in CUFA men. Cognitive Flexibility Inventory was conducted in subpopulation 2 (54 CUFA individuals, 214 controls) over 20 years to investigate the associations between sex hormone levels, cognitive function, and CUFA. Male rats (n = 27) were randomly allocated to the NC group (normal chow controls), RN group (CUFA, refeeding after caloric restriction), and RT group (RN with testosterone intramuscular injected while refeeding). The blood testosterone levels, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT), and FINS were measured, and the attentional set-shifting task test (ASST) for the assessment of cognitive function was performed in these animals. Insulin signaling pathway, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors subtype 2A (NR2A) and 2B (NR2B) expression levels were determined in the rat cerebral cortex.
The total testosterone levels decreased (medium [inter-quartile ranges], 13.43 [9.87-18.96] vs. 15.58 [13.37-24.96], p = 0.036), and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) elevated (1.61 [1.08-2.33] vs. 1.24 [0.87-1.87], P = 0.037) in CUFA men in subpopulation 1. Additionally, cognitive impairment was observed in CUFA men in subpopulation 2. Moreover, our results indicated decreases in total and free testosterone levels, elevations in visceral lipid accumulation, FINS, HOMA-IR, blood glucose, and the area under the curve after IPITT, increases in the number of trials required to achieve the criterion of the first reversal of discrimination (R1) in ASST, and downregulation of IRS-1 mRNA expression, AKT phosphorylation, and the NR2A and NR2B expression in brain tissue in male CUFA rats. Notably, testosterone supplementation improved visceral lipid accumulation and IR-related metabolic disorders, cognitive dysfunction, decreases in IRS-1 mRNA expression, Akt phosphorylation, and NR2A and NR2B expression in brain tissue in male CUFA rodents.
CUFA was characterized by reduced testosterone levels, metabolic abnormalities, and cognitive dysfunction in males, and testosterone supplementation attenuated these changes, as well as the alteration in insulin signaling and NR2A and NR2B expression in male CUFA rodents. Herein, we tentatively put forward that CUFA in males induces low testosterone, consequently promoting metabolic abnormalities and cognitive impairment probably mediated by defects in insulin signaling and NR2A, NR2B pathway in brain tissue.","['catch-up fat in adults', 'cognitive dysfunction', 'metabolic abnormalities', 'testosterone']",Andrology,2022-03-28,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'XiaoHuan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Qiao', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'TianShu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'JiaoYue', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Min', 'firstname': 'Jie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tian', 'firstname': 'ShengHua', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Hantao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Emergency Medicine, Yiling Hospital, Yichang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Weidong', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Department of Internal Medicine, The People's Hosptial of Maojian, Shiyan, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Fangfang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Internal Medicine, The People's Hosptial of Maojian, Shiyan, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ping', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Precision Health Program, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Linwei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shuang', 'firstname': 'Zhenyu', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Department of Endocrinology, Yueyang People's Hosptial, Yueyang, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'LuLu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Xiang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nHubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Wuhan, China.'}]",,,"The total testosterone levels decreased (medium [inter-quartile ranges], 13.43 [9.87-18.96] vs. 15.58 [13.37-24.96], p = 0.036), and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) elevated (1.61 [1.08-2.33] vs. 1.24 [0.87-1.87], P = 0.037) in CUFA men in subpopulation 1.

In this work, we evaluated by in silico studies a set of boron-containing melatonin analogues on MT1 and MT2 receptors. Then, we synthesized a compound (borolatonin) identified as potent agonist. After chemical characterization, its evaluation in a rat model with cognitive deficit showed that it induced ameliorative effects such as those induced by equimolar administration of melatonin in behavioral tests and in neuronal immunohistochemistry assays. Our results suggest the observed effects are by means of action on the melatonin system. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism(s) of action, as the beneficial effects on disturbed memory by gonadectomy in male rats are attractive.","['Alzheimer', 'amyloid', 'androgen depletion', 'boron', 'boron-containing compounds', 'boroxazolidone', 'cognitive deficit', 'male rat', 'melatonin', 'melatonin receptors']",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-03-26,"[{'lastname': 'Barrón-González', 'firstname': 'Mónica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Academias de Fisiología, Bioquímica Médica, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Plan de San Luis y Diaz Mirón s/n, Col.

32101117",The effects of androgen deprivation on working memory and quality of life in prostate cancer patients: The roles of hypothalamic connectivity.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been associated with adverse effects on the brain. ADT alters testosterone levels via its action on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis and may influence hypothalamic functions. Given the wide regional connectivity of the hypothalamus and its role in regulating cognition and behavior, we assessed the effects of ADT on hypothalamic resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and their cognitive and clinical correlates.
In a prospective observational study, 22 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT and 28 patients not receiving ADT (controls), matched in age, years of education, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, participated in N-back task and quality of life (QoL) assessments and brain imaging at baseline and at 6 months. Imaging data were processed with published routines and the results of a group by time flexible factorial analysis were evaluated at a corrected threshold.
ADT and control groups did not differ in N-back performance or QoL across time points. Relative to controls, patients receiving ADT showed significantly higher hypothalamus-right mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) and precentral gyrus (PCG) rsFC during follow-up versus baseline. Further, the changes in MCC and PCG rsFC were correlated positively with the change in QoL score and 0-back correct response rate, respectively, in patients with undergoing ADT.
Six-month ADT affects hypothalamic functional connectivity with brain regions critical to cognitive motor and affective functions. Elevated hypothalamic MCC and PCG connectivity likely serve to functionally compensate for the effects of ADT and sustain attention and overall QoL. The longer-term effects of ADT remain to be investigated.","['androgen deprivation therapy', 'cognition', 'hypothalamus', 'prostate cancer', 'quality of life', 'resting state fMRI']",Cancer medicine,2022-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Chaudhary', 'firstname': 'Shefali', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhornitsky', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'Alicia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Summers', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahles', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Chiang-Shan R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, Yale University School of Medicine, Wu Tsai Institute, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Herta H', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine & Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.'}]",,Six-month ADT affects hypothalamic functional connectivity with brain regions critical to cognitive motor and affective functions.

31501588",Androgen-targeting therapeutics mitigate the adverse effect of GnRH agonist on the risk of neurodegenerative disease in men treated for prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer and multiple neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) share an age-associated pattern of onset. Therapy of prostate cancer is known to impact cognitive function. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of multiple classes of androgen-targeting therapeutics (ATT) on the risk of NDD.
A retrospective cohort study of men aged 45 and older with prostate within the US-based Mariner claims data set between January 1 and 27, 2021. A propensity score approach was used to minimize measured and unmeasured selection bias. Disease risk was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.
Of the 1,798,648 men with prostate cancer, 209,722 met inclusion criteria. Mean (SD) follow-up was 6.4 (1.8) years. In the propensity score-matched population, exposure to ATT was associated with a minimal increase in NDD incidence (relative risk [RR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10; p < 0.001). However, GnRH agonists alone were associated with significantly increased NDD risk (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.30-1.66; p <0.001). Abiraterone, commonly administered with GnRH agonists and low-dose prednisone, was associated with a significantly decreased risk (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87; p < 0.001) of any NDD.
Among patients with prostate cancer, GnRH agonist exposure was associated with an increased NDD risk. Abiraterone acetate reduced the risks of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease conferred by GnRH agonists, whereas the risk for ALS was reduced by androgen receptor inhibitors. Outcomes of these analyses contribute to addressing controversies in the field and indicate that GnRH agonism may be a predictable instigator of risk for NDD with opportunities for risk mitigation in combination with another ATT.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'abiraterone', 'androgen', 'medical informatics', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'prostate cancer']",Cancer medicine,2022-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Branigan', 'firstname': 'Gregory L', 'initials': 'GL', 'affiliation': 'Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nMedical Scientist Training Program, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Torrandell-Haro', 'firstname': 'Georgina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Soto', 'firstname': 'Maira', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gelmann', 'firstname': 'Edward P', 'initials': 'EP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Arizona College of Medicine and University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vitali', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nCenter for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodgers', 'firstname': 'Kathleen E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brinton', 'firstname': 'Roberta Diaz', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Center for Innovation in Brain Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, USA.'}]",,,"Of the 1,798,648 men with prostate cancer, 209,722 met inclusion criteria.

31858249",Feasibility and safety of physical exercise in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy: a study protocol.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy (RT) increase survival in selected patients with prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the side effects of these therapies are associated with an increased risk of accidental falls and fractures and a decreased quality of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that physical exercise can be a valid strategy to reduce the side effects of ADT and RT in men with prostate cancer. Despite this knowledge, most patients with prostate cancer are insufficiently active, and there is a lack of data on the safety and adherence to the recommended dose of physical exercise. This study protocol is designed to examine the feasibility and safety of a multicomponent experimental physical exercise intervention targeting psychophysical and cognitive functions and the quality of life in this population.
This is a pilot feasibility study. Twenty-five men currently treated with ADT and RT for prostate cancer will be invited to participate in a 20-week, multicomponent physical exercise intervention, including supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions and meeting the current recommendation for exercise in cancer. The primary outcomes are physical exercise feasibility (recruitment, adherence and drop-out rates) and safety (adverse events related and unrelated to the intervention). The secondary outcomes are muscle strength, balance, fatigue, symptoms of anxiety and depression, cognitive function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. We will also record the number of accidental falls and fractures occurring during the intervention and at 1 year of follow-up.
The study has received ethics approval from The Area Vasta Nord Local Ethics Committee (Province of Reggio Emilia, 23 June 2020, Number 520/2020/SPER/IRCCSRE). Recruitment began in September 2020 and will be completed in September 2021. The results will be disseminated through scientific journals and conference presentations.

111,35282994,Testicular biopsy for fertility preservation in early-diagnosed Klinefelter patients: patient characteristics and long-term follow-up.,"Which early-diagnosed Klinefelter syndrome patients have been offered cryopreservation of testicular tissue as part of fertility preservation before spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) loss? Do these Klinefelter syndrome patients present with behavioural, cognitive and/or psychological problems? Does a testicular biopsy procedure have long-term effects on the gonadal development of Klinefelter syndrome patients?
Early-diagnosed Klinefelter syndrome patients followed between 2009 and 2020 and offered testicular tissue banking in an experimental context at the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel were included. The prevalence of behavioural, cognitive and/or psychological problems was determined. Changes in testicular volume and in gonadal function (LH, FSH, testosterone and inhibin B [INHB]) were studied.
Of the 48 Klinefelter syndrome patients included, 22 had testicular tissue removed (biopsy group) and 26 had no surgical intervention (control group). The need for specialized education was significantly higher in prenatally (P = 0.0159) and prepubertally (P = 0.0002) diagnosed Klinefelter syndrome patients. Psychological problems were significantly more prevalent in Klinefelter syndrome patients who did not opt for fertility preservation (P = 0.0447). In the first 4.2 (1.9-9.1) years after testicular biopsy, no difference in testicular volume was observed between the biopsied and the contralateral non-biopsied testes (P > 0.9999). After pubertal onset, no differences in LH, FSH, testosterone and INHB were found between the biopsy and the control groups (P = 0.1324 for LH, P > 0.9999 for FSH, P = 0.5433 for testosterone, P > 0.9999 for INHB).
Early-diagnosed Klinefelter syndrome patients presented with behavioural, cognitive and/or psychological problems. Only psychological problems seemed to influence the decision towards fertility preservation. Follow-up data confirm that harvesting testicular tissue does not have a long-term impact on the gonadal development of Klinefelter syndrome patients.","['Fertility preservation', 'Gonadal development', 'Klinefelter syndrome', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Testicular biopsy']",Reproductive biomedicine online,2022-03-15,"[{'lastname': 'Braye', 'firstname': 'Aude', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Department of Reproduction, Genetics and Regenerative Medicine (RGRG), Biology of the Testis (BITE), Laarbeeklaan 103, Brussels 1090, Belgium.

112,35266057,Testosterone treatment of late-onset hypogonadism - benefits and risks.,"As men age, their serum testosterone concentration falls, the total testosterone concentration barely but the free testosterone concentration more so. Testosterone treatment of older men who have low testosterone concentrations can ameliorate several consequences of this fall, including libido and sexual activity, distance walked, hemoglobin and volumetric bone mineral density and strength, but not vitality and cognitive function. The possibility that testosterone treatment of late-onset hypogonadism increases the risks of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer or heart disease has been suggested but will not be determined until larger and longer trials are conducted.","['Hypogonadism', 'Late-onset hypogonadism', 'Testosterone']",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2022-03-11,"[{'lastname': 'Snyder', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. pjs@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.'}]",,,,"© 2022.

113,35257713,"Salivary testosterone, testosterone/cortisol ratio and non-verbal behavior in stress.","The relationship between hormone release and non-verbal communication under stress conditions is still not sufficiently explored. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that salivary testosterone concentrations and testosterone/cortisol (T/C) ratios correlate positively with assertive behavior representing a non-aggressive form of dominance during an acute stress situation. As a stress model, a socially evaluated cold pressor test was investigated in healthy men. The non-verbal behavior was analyzed according to the ethological coding system for interviews described by Troisi (1999). Salivary testosterone concentrations did not change throughout the stress test. The T/C ratios decreased significantly over time only in subjects showing high stress perception. The duration of affiliative and the frequency of flight behavior was higher in subjects with high stress perception compared to those with low stress perception. A significant positive correlation between the duration of prosocial behavior and values of T/C ratios was found in the whole sample. The area under the curve values of testosterone positively correlated with the duration of assertive behavior in the group with high stress perception and negatively in the other group. Our findings allow suggesting that the changes in non-verbal behavior during acute psychosocial stress situations may be more pronounced in subjects showing high stress perception. Obtained results motivate further research on a better understanding of the consequences of the lack of sense of full facial expressions, such as wearing face masks, on the balance between hormones and non-verbal behavior under stress conditions.","['Prosocial behavior', 'Psychosocial stress', 'Testosterone', 'Testosterone/cortisol ratio']",Steroids,2022-03-09,"[{'lastname': 'Romanova', 'firstname': 'Z', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Pharmacological Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University Bratislava, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hrivikova', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Pharmacological Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Riecansky', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, Institute of Normal and Pathological Physiology, Centre of Experimental Medicine, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia; Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Unit, Department of Cognition, Emotion, and Methods in Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Jezova', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Pharmacological Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.

34312190",Should Dehydroepiandrosterone Be Administered to Women?,"Androgen prohormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) increase in early puberty, peak in the second and third decade, and thereafter decline, independent of menopausal status. Investigators have examined their potential beneficial effects in normal women and those with DHEA-deficient states.
A review of the literature from 1985 to 2021 on the potential benefits and risks of androgen prohormones in women.
Studies have examined the potential benefit of DHEA therapy for anti-aging, sexual dysfunction, infertility, metabolic bone health, cognition, and wellbeing in hormone-deficient states such as primary adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and anorexia as well as administration to normal women across the lifespan.
Data support small benefits in quality of life and mood but not for anxiety or sexual function in women with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or anorexia. No consistent beneficial effects of DHEA administration have been observed for menopausal symptoms, sexual function, cognition, or overall wellbeing in normal women. Local administration of DHEA shows benefit in vulvovaginal atrophy. Use of DHEA to improve induction of ovulation response in women with diminished ovarian reserve is not recommended. Risks of high physiologic or pharmacologic use of DHEA include androgenic and estrogenic side effects which are of concern for long-term administration.
A 49-year-old woman with Addison's disease who is on low dose estrogen with cyclic progesterone therapy for menopausal symptoms returns for follow-up. She is on a stable glucocorticoid replacement strategy of hydrocortisone 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the early afternoon and fludrocortisone 0.05 mg each morning. She has read on the internet that additional therapy with DHEA may help her overall quality of life and libido. She asks whether she should add this therapy to her regimen and at what dose.","['DHEA', 'androstenedione', 'hormonal therapies', 'testosterone']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2022-03-08,"[{'lastname': 'Wierman', 'firstname': 'Margaret E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.\nRocky Mountain Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiseljak-Vassiliades', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.\nRocky Mountain Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.'}]",,,,"© The Author(s) 2022.

29111960",Associations between blood sex steroid concentrations and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in healthy older women in Australia: a prospective cohort substudy of the ASPREE trial.,"Blood testosterone concentrations in women decline during the reproductive years and reach a nadir in the seventh decade, after which concentrations increase and are restored to those of reproductive-aged women early in the eighth decade. We aimed to establish the association between the concentration of testosterone in the blood and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality in healthy older women.
SHOW was a prospective cohort substudy of the longitudinal randomised ASPREE trial. Eligible participants were women aged at least 70 years from Australia with unimpaired cognition, no previous MACE, and a life expectancy of at least 5 years. Participants who were receiving hormonal or steroid therapy were ineligible for inclusion. We measured serum concentrations of sex steroids with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and of SHBG with immunoassay. We compared lower concentrations of sex hormones with higher concentrations using four quartiles. Primary endpoints were risk of MACE and all-cause mortality, the associations of which with sex steroid concentrations were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression that included age, body-mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, impaired renal function, and treatment allocation in the ASPREE trial (aspirin 
Of the 9180 women recruited to the ASPREE trial between March 10, 2010, and Dec 31 2014, 6358 participants provided sufficient biobank samples at baseline and 5535 were included in the final analysis. Median age at entry was 74·0 years (IQR 71·7-77·7). During a median 4·4 years of follow-up (24 553 person-years), 144 (2·6%) women had a first MACE (incidence 5·9 per 1000 person-years). During a median 4·6 years of follow-up (3·8-5·6), 200 women died (7·9 per 1000 person-years). In the fully adjusted models, higher concentrations of testosterone were associated with a lower incidence of MACE (quartile 4 
Blood concentrations of testosterone and DHEA above the lowest quartile in older women were associated with a reduced risk of a first-ever MACE. Given that the physiological effects of DHEA are mediated through its steroid metabolites, if the current findings were to be replicated, trials investigating testosterone therapy for the primary prevention of ischaemic cardiovascular disease events in older women would be warranted.

116,35232367,Epigenetic Modifications by Estrogen and Androgen in Alzheimer's Disease.,"For the development and maintenance of neuron networks in the brain, epigenetic mechanisms are necessary, as indicated by recent findings. This includes some of the high-order brain processes, such as behavior and cognitive functions. Epigenetic mechanisms could influence the pathophysiology or etiology of some neuronal diseases, altering disease susceptibility and therapy responses. Recent studies support epigenetic dysfunctions in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These dysfunctions in epigenetic mechanisms also play crucial roles in the transgenerational effects of the environment on the brain and subsequently in the inheritance of pathologies. The possible role of gonadal steroids in the etiology and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, has become the subject of a growing body of research over the last 20 years. Recent scientific findings suggest that epigenetic changes, driven by estrogen and androgens, play a vital role in brain functioning. Therefore, exploring the role of estrogen and androgen-based epigenetic changes in the brain is critical for the deeper understanding of AD. This review highlights the epigenetic modifications caused by these two gonadal steroids and the possible therapeutic strategies for AD.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'androgen', 'brain', 'epigenetic modifications', 'estrogen', 'neuronal diseases']",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2022-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Rajnish', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Fatima', 'firstname': 'Faiza', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Yadav', 'firstname': 'Garima', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Simran', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Haldar', 'firstname': 'Subhagata', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Alexiou', 'firstname': 'Athanasios', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Novel Global Community Educational Foundation, Hebersham, 2770 NSW, Australia, and AFNP Med Austria, 1010 Wien, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Ashraf', 'firstname': 'Ghulam Md', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Pre-Clinical Research Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}]",,,,"Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",10.2174/1871527321666220225110501,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcc93e50>,,,,,,

10613504","Deviant circadian rhythmicity, corticosterone variability and trait testosterone levels in aggressive mice.","Although aggression has been linked to disturbances of circadian rhythm, insight into the neural substrate of this association is currently lacking. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the master circadian clock, is regulated by clock genes and known to influence the secretion of cortisosterone and testosterone, important hormones implicated in aggression. Here, we investigated deviations in the regulation of the locomotor circadian rhythm and hormonal levels in a mouse model of abnormal aggression. We tested aggressive BALB/cJ and control BALB/cByJ mice in the resident-intruder paradigm and compared them on their locomotor circadian rhythm during a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and constant darkness. State (serum) corticosterone and trait (hair) corticosterone and testosterone levels were determined, and immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expression of important clock proteins, PER1 and PER2, in the core and shell of the SCN at the start of their active phase. Compared with BALB/cByJ mice, aggressive BALB/cJ mice displayed: (1) a shorter free-running period in constant darkness; (2) reduced state corticosterone variability between circadian peak and trough but no differences in corticosterone trait levels; (3) lower testosterone trait levels; (4) higher PER1 expression in the SCN shell with no changes in PER2 in either SCN subregion during the early dark phase. Together, these results suggest that aggressive BALB/cJ mice have disturbances in different components encompassing the circadian and hormonal cycle, emphasizing their value for future investigation of the causal relationship between SCN function, circadian clocks and aggression.","['aggression', 'circadian rhythms', 'clock', 'corticosterone', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus', 'testosterone']",The European journal of neuroscience,2022-03-02,"[{'lastname': 'Mogavero', 'firstname': 'Floriana', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Zwieten', 'firstname': 'Kitty', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Buitelaar', 'firstname': 'Jan K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Glennon', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nConway Institute of Biomedical and Biomolecular Sciences, School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Henckens', 'firstname': 'Marloes J A G', 'initials': 'MJAG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,© 2022 The Authors.

Neurocognitive performance and self-report of cognitive function were assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were obtained at baseline and 6 months.
No between-group differences in cognitive function were demonstrated. Increased visceral adiposity was not associated with decrements in visuospatial abilities. Significant increases in fat mass without increases in body mass index or waist-hip ratio provided further evidence for DEXA as the preferred central adiposity measure.

22520298",The Link Between Masculinity and Spatial Skills Is Moderated by the Estrogenic and Progestational Activity of Oral Contraceptives.,"Conversations about gender and spatial skills frequently dissolve into a hackneyed debate over nature and nurture. This is particularly true for conversations concerning three-dimensional (3D) mental rotations skill, which shows the largest gender difference of all aspects of cognition, with men-on average-outperforming women. To advance this empirical area of inquiry, biopsychosocial influences on spatial skills should be considered, and a unique opportunity do to that is provided by combined oral contraceptives (OCs). OCs with relatively low estradiol doses and with highly androgenic progestins have been positively related to spatial skills. Gender self-concepts, including masculine and feminine self-perceptions, have also been positively related to spatial skills. It is wholly unknown, however, whether the exogenous sex hormones contained in OCs moderate the link between self-perceived masculinity and 3D mental rotations. This study filled that knowledge gap by utilizing a sample of 141 naturally cycling (NC) women and 229 OC users who completed a computerized survey and cognitive tests. A series of moderation analyses examined whether the link between masculinity and 3D mental rotations depended on pill use or on the estrogenic, progestational, or androgenic activity in OCs, which were operationalized using a novel coding scheme. Results showed that the positive masculinity-3D mental rotations link was only present for NC women, presumably because it was altered by the exogenous hormones in OCs. Indeed, the link was accentuated in users of OCs with relatively low estrogenic and high progestational activity. Future research on menstrual cycle and pill phase is needed, but these findings importantly delineate ways in which biological and psychosocial factors combine to explain variation in spatial skills among women. They also suggest that focus should be placed on the under-investigated progestational activity of OCs, which is facilitated by the novel quantification of OC action used in this study. Thus, this research increases understanding of the neurocognitive and behavioral correlates of ovarian hormones and has implications for the betterment of women's health.","['androgenic activity', 'estrogenic activity', 'femininity', 'hormonal contraceptive', 'masculinity', 'mental rotation (MR)', 'ovarian hormones', 'progestational activity']",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2022-02-15,"[{'lastname': 'Beltz', 'firstname': 'Adriene M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Loviska', 'firstname': 'Amy M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.\nDepartment of Human Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelly', 'firstname': 'Dominic P', 'initials': 'DP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Nielson', 'firstname': 'Matthew G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Beltz, Loviska, Kelly and Nielson.","10.3389/fnbeh.2021.777911

122,35150156,Effect of estradiol on cognition in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: A randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"Roles for estradiol in modulating cognition in men remain uncertain. We assessed the isolated effects of estradiol on cognition in men in the absence of testosterone.
Randomized trial of transdermal estradiol 0.9 mg daily, or matched placebo, for 6 months, hypothesizing that estradiol would improve verbal learning, verbal memory, and spatial problem solving over time.
Men receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.
Cognition was assessed by a tablet-based cognitive battery (Cogstate) at baseline, Month 1, Month 3, and Month 6. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
Seventy-eight participants were randomized. Baseline mean scores were 21.0 (standard deviation [SD] 4.1) for the International Shopping List test (ISL), assessing verbal learning and memory (higher scores better), and 60.4 (SD 19.5) for the Groton Maze Learning test (GML), assessing spatial problem solving (lower scores better). There was no significant difference in performance over time for the estradiol group versus the placebo group for the ISL, mean adjusted difference (MAD) 0.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.2 to 2.5), p = .36, or the GML, MAD -3.2 (95% CI -12.0 to 5.6), p = 0.53. There was no significant difference between groups over time in performance in any other cognitive domain, or on depression or anxiety scores.
We found no major effects of estradiol on cognition in men with castrate testosterone concentrations. Although the cognitive effects of ADT are debated, this study suggests that any such effects are unlikely to be prevented by the administration of estradiol.","['androgens', 'cognition', 'estradiol', 'hypogonadism', 'men', 'prostatic neoplasms', 'testosterone']",Clinical endocrinology,2022-02-13,"[{'lastname': 'Russell', 'firstname': 'Nicholas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Allebone', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dandash', 'firstname': 'Orwa', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoermann', 'firstname': 'Rudolf', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheung', 'firstname': 'Ada S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zajac', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Handelsman', 'firstname': 'David J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Andrology, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanaan', 'firstname': 'Richard A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Grossmann', 'firstname': 'Mathis', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Austin Health, The University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Australia.'}]",,,"Seventy-eight participants were randomized.

123,35121300,Exploring the role of endocrine factors in sensitive parenting in men.,"Parental sensitivity has been studied extensively in parenting research. Recently, there has been increasing attention to endocrine factors that may be related to parental sensitivity, such as oxytocin, vasopressin, testosterone, and cortisol. Although hormones do not act in isolation, few studies integrated multiple hormones and examined their combined associations with parental sensitivity. The current study aimed to explore the hormonal correlates of paternal sensitivity by examining in 79 first-time fathers of young infants (2-4 months old) (1) the separate and combined associations of basal oxytocin, vasopressin, testosterone, and cortisol levels with sensitivity, and (2) the associations between paternal sensitivity and oxytocin, vasopressin, testosterone, and cortisol reactivity following father-infant interactions. We additionally explored whether interactions between the various basal hormone levels could predict paternal sensitivity. Saliva for the quantification of fathers' hormone levels was sampled before and after an interaction with their infant to determine basal levels and reactivity. Results revealed no significant associations between sensitivity and basal hormone levels or reactivity. However, results indicated that cortisol and testosterone interacted in their effects on paternal sensitive parenting. Namely, fathers with low basal cortisol levels showed more sensitivity with increasing T levels, but fathers with high cortisol levels were less sensitive with increasing T levels. However, it should be noted that the latter slope was not significantly different from zero. These findings suggest that variations in parental sensitivity might be better explained by interactions between hormones than by single hormone levels.","['Cortisol', 'Fathers', 'Oxytocin', 'Sensitivity', 'Testosterone', 'Vasopressin']",Hormones and behavior,2022-02-06,"[{'lastname': 'Lotz', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands; Institute of Education and Child Studies, Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Leiden University, the Netherlands.

124,35115156,Testosterone: much more for the brain than a sex hormone.,"Despite substantial advocacy for the scientific community to focus on sex-specific differences in biology, the role of sex hormones remains inadequately studied in the field of anaesthesia-induced developmental neurotoxicity. A recent study by Yang and colleagues published in this journal addresses the importance of studying sex hormones during critical stages of brain development. The authors demonstrate that exogenous testosterone administered to immature mice pups around the time of sevoflurane exposure increased brain levels of testosterone, attenuated tau phosphorylation, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3β activation and its interaction/binding with tau, reversed sevoflurane-induced decreases in neuronal activation, and attenuated cognitive impairments. Their well-designed experiments suggest an important role that testosterone plays in balancing several important pathways crucial for neuronal protection and normal function of neuronal circuits in the male mammalian brain.","['anaesthetic neurotoxicity', 'children', 'cognitive development', 'immature brain', 'tau phosphorylation']",British journal of anaesthesia,2022-02-05,"[{'lastname': 'Jevtovic-Todorovic', 'firstname': 'Vesna', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA; Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.

27717790",Identifying the outcomes important to men with hypogonadism: A qualitative evidence synthesis.,"Men with male hypogonadism (MH) experience sexual dysfunction, which improves with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). However, randomised controlled trials provide little consensus on functional and behavioural symptoms in hypogonadal men; these are often better captured by qualitative information from individual patient experience.
We systematically searched major electronic databases to identify qualitative data from men with hypogonadism, with or without TRT. Two independent authors performed the selection, extraction, and thematic analysis of data. Quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research tools.
We analysed data from five studies published in nine reports that assessed a total of 284 participants. Published data were only available within North America, with no ethnic minority or other underserved groups included. In addition to sexual dysfunction, men with MH experienced adverse changes in physical strength, perceptions of masculinity, cognitive function, and quality of life. The experience of MH appeared dependent on the source(s) of educational material.
We propose a patient-centred approach to clinician interactions rather than focusing on discreet MH symptoms. Current evidence about the experience of MH is limited to North America and predominantly white ethnicity, which may not be broadly applicable to other geographic regions. Broadening our understanding of the MH experience may improve the targeting of information to patients. In addition, a multidisciplinary approach may better address symptoms neither attributable to MH nor alleviated by TRT.","['male hypogonadism', 'qualitative systematic review', 'testosterone replacement therapy']",Andrology,2022-01-23,"[{'lastname': 'Aceves-Martins', 'firstname': 'Magaly', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Quinton', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Brazzelli', 'firstname': 'Miriam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Cruickshank', 'firstname': 'Moira', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Manson', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hudson', 'firstname': 'Jemma', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Oliver', 'firstname': 'Nick', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hernandez', 'firstname': 'Rodolfo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Health Economics Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Aucott', 'firstname': 'Lorna', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Frederick', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology & Gastroenterology, Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Dhillo', 'firstname': 'Waljit S', 'initials': 'WS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhattacharya', 'firstname': 'Siladitya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gillies', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jayasena', 'firstname': 'Channa N', 'initials': 'CN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.'}]",,,"We analysed data from five studies published in nine reports that assessed a total of 284 participants.

25984882",The Utilization of Dehydroepiandrosterone as a Sexual Hormone Precursor in Premenopausal and Postmenopausal Women: An Overview.,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and its metabolite, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ester (DHEAS), are the most abundant circulating steroid hormones, and are synthesized in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, in the gonads, and in the brain. The precise physiological role of DHEA and DHEAS is not yet fully understood, but these steroid hormones can act as androgens, estrogens, and neurosteroids, and perform many roles in the human body. Since both levels decline with age, use of DHEA supplements have gained more attention due to being advertised as an antidote to aging in postmenopausal women, who may have concerns on age-related diseases and overall well-being. However, current research has not reached an overall consensus on the effects of DHEA on postmenopausal women. This overview is a summary of the current literature, addressing the metabolic pathway for DHEA synthesis and utilization, as well as the effects of DHEA on premenopausal and postmenopausal women with disease states and other factors. As for the therapeutic effects on menopausal syndrome and other age-related diseases, several studies have found that DHEA supplementations can alleviate vasomotor symptoms, preserve the integrity of the immune system, reduce bone loss, and increase muscle mass. Intravaginal DHEA has shown significant beneficial effects in menopausal women with severe vulvovaginal symptoms. On the other hand, DHEA supplements have not shown definitive effects in cardiovascular disease, adrenal insufficiency, insulin sensitivity, and cognition. Due to inadequate sample sizes and treatment durations of current studies, it is difficult to assess the safety and efficacy of DHEA and draw reliable conclusions for the physiological role, the optimal dosage, and the effects on premenopausal and postmenopausal women; therefore, the study of DHEA warrants future investigation. Further research into the roles of these steroid hormones may bring us closer to a therapeutic option in the future.","['DHEA', 'DHEAS', 'dehydroepiandrosterone', 'menopause']","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2022-01-22,"[{'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Justine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Li-Ru', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei 104, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Kuo-Hu', 'initials': 'KH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taipei Tzu-Chi Hospital, The Buddhist Tzu-Chi Medical Foundation, Taipei 231, Taiwan.\nSchool of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ph15010046

127,35030506,"Severity of anabolic steroid dependence, executive function, and personality traits in substance use disorder patients in Norway.","Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), including testosterone and synthetic derivatives, are typically used to increase muscle mass. Many users develop a dependence on these substances, contributing to worsened physical and mental health outcomes. Aspects of personality and executive dysfunction may represent underlying vulnerabilities for developing dependence.
To identify levels of AAS dependence within substance use disorder (SUD) treatment patients and assess the relationship between dependence severity and personality traits and executive function (EF).
Data were collected from patients at 38 SUD treatment facilities in Norway. Questionnaires were completed for measures of personality and EF. Measures of symptoms of AAS dependence were used in latent class analysis to identify sub-groups of patients, which were evaluated for association with EF and personality traits, and compared with a group of non-AAS using SUD patients.
Three classes were identified; largely reflecting low, moderate, and high symptoms of dependence. Multinomial regression analyses indicated that moderate and high symptoms were associated with several measures of EF and personality traits, particularly self-monitoring, antagonism, disinhibition, and rigid perfectionism while users with low symptoms exhibited higher capacities for emotional control and shift, and lower negative affectivity, relative to non-AAS using SUD patients. Backward stepwise regressions indicated antagonism, and decreased self-monitoring as key personality and cognitive characteristics of SUD patients with severe AAS dependence.
Our findings indicate that specific executive dysfunctions and personality features, particularly those associated with poor emotional control, reduced empathy, and impulsivity are associated with more severe AAS dependence in the SUD population.","['Anabolic androgenic steroids', 'Executive function', 'Latent class analysis', 'Personality', 'Substance use disorder']",Drug and alcohol dependence,2022-01-15,"[{'lastname': 'Scarth', 'firstname': 'Morgan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, Section for Clinical Addiction Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.

24444806",Androgens and Adult Neurogenesis in the Hippocampus.,"Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is modulated by steroid hormones, including androgens, in male rodents. In this review, we summarize research showing that chronic exposure to androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, enhances the survival of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of male, but not female, rodents, via the androgen receptor. However, the neurogenesis promoting the effect of androgens in the dentate gyrus may be limited to younger adulthood as it is not evident in middle-aged male rodents. Although direct exposure to androgens in adult or middle age does not significantly influence neurogenesis in female rodents, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole enhances neurogenesis in the hippocampus of middle-aged female mice. Unlike other androgens, androgenic anabolic steroids reduce neurogenesis in the hippocampus of male rodents. Collectively, the research indicates that the ability of androgens to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rodents is dependent on dose, androgen type, sex, duration, and age. We discuss these findings and how androgens may be influencing neuroprotection, via neurogenesis in the hippocampus, in the context of health and disease.","['aging', 'cognition', 'dentate gyrus', 'dihydrotestosterone', 'sex differences', 'testosterone']",Androgens: clinical research and therapeutics,2022-01-14,"[{'lastname': 'Blankers', 'firstname': 'Samantha A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.\nDjavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Galea', 'firstname': 'Liisa A M', 'initials': 'LAM', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.\nDjavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychology, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}]",,,,"© Samantha A.

32561386",Impact of Testosterone on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease responsible for almost half of all dementia cases in the world and progressively increasing. The etiopathology includes heritability, genetic factors, aging, nutrition, but sex hormones play a relevant role. Animal models demonstrated that testosterone (T) exerted a neuroprotective effect reducing the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ), improving synaptic signaling, and counteracting neuronal death. This study aims to evaluate the impact of T deprivation and T administration in humans on the onset of dementia and AD. A search was conducted on MEDLINE and Scopus for the ""androgen deprivation therapy"" and ""testosterone therapy"" with ""dementia"" and ""Alzheimer's."" Studies lasting twenty years with low risk of bias, randomized clinical trial, and case-controlled studies were considered. Twelve articles on the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and AD and seventeen on T therapy and AD were retrieved. Men with prostate cancer under ADT showed a higher incidence of dementia and AD. The effect of T administration in hypogonadal men with AD and cognitive impairment has evidenced some positive results. The majority of studies showed the T administration improved memory and cognition in AD while others did not find any benefit. Although some biases in the studies are evident, T therapy for AD patients may represent an essential clinical therapy to reduce dementia incidence and AD progression. However, more specific case-controlled trials on the effect of androgens therapy in men and women to reducing the onset of AD are necessary.","['Alzheimer disease', 'Amyloid beta-peptides', 'Dementia', 'Estradiol', 'Neuroprotection', 'Testosterone']",The world journal of men's health,2022-01-13,"[{'lastname': 'Bianchi', 'firstname': 'Vittorio Emanuele', 'initials': 'VE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Clinical Research Center Stella Maris, Falciano, San Marino, Italy. dott.vbianchi@gmail.com.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2022 Korean Society for Sexual Medicine and Andrology.,10.5534/wjmh.210175,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbbc88b0>,,,,,,

34781285","Biomarkers to Evaluate Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer and Risk of Alzheimer's Disease and Neurodegeneration: Old Drugs, New Concerns.","Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard treatment for prostate cancer patients, routinely used in the palliative or in the curative setting in association with radiotherapy. Among the systemic long-term side effects of ADT, growing data suggest a potentially increased risk of dementia/Alzheimer's disease in prostate cancer patients treated with hormonal manipulation. While pre-clinical data suggest that androgen ablation may have neurotoxic effects due to Aβ accumulation and increased tau phosphorylation in small animal brains, clinical studies have measured the impact of ADT on long-term cognitive function, with conflicting results, and studies on biological changes after ADT are still lacking. The aim of this review is to report on the current evidence on the association between the ADT use and the risk of cognitive impairment in prostate cancer patients. We will focus on the contribution of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, namely through imaging, to investigate potential ADT-induced brain modifications. The evidence from these preliminary studies shows brain changes in gray matter volume, cortical activation and metabolism associated with ADT, however with a large variability in biomarker selection, ADT duration and cognitive outcome. Importantly, no study investigated yet biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology, namely amyloid and tau. These preliminary data emphasize the need for larger targeted investigations.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'androgen deprivation therapy', 'biomarkers', 'blood', 'dementia', 'functional brain imaging', 'prostate cancer']",Frontiers in oncology,2022-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Achard', 'firstname': 'Vérane', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ceyzériat', 'firstname': 'Kelly', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.\nDivision of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Diagnostic Department, Geneva University Hospitals, and NimtLab, Faculty of Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.\nDivision of Adult Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Tournier', 'firstname': 'Benjamin B', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Adult Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Frisoni', 'firstname': 'Giovanni B', 'initials': 'GB', 'affiliation': 'Memory Clinic, Department of Rehabilitation and Geriatrics, Geneva University and University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Garibotto', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Diagnostic Department, Geneva University Hospitals, and NimtLab, Faculty of Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Zilli', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2021 Achard, Ceyzériat, Tournier, Frisoni, Garibotto and Zilli.","10.3389/fonc.2021.734881

133,34896406,Structural covariance of amygdala subregions is associated with trait aggression and endogenous testosterone in healthy individuals.,"Many studies point toward volume reductions in the amygdala as a potential neurostructural marker for trait aggression. However, most of these findings stem from clinical samples, rendering unclear whether the findings generalize to non-clinical populations. Furthermore, the notion of neural networks suggests that interregional correlations in gray matter volume (i.e., structural covariance) can explain individual differences in aggressive behavior beyond local univariate associations. Here, we tested whether structural covariance between amygdala subregions and the rest of the brain is associated with self-reported aggression in a large sample of healthy young students (n = 263; 49% women). Salivary testosterone concentrations were measured for a subset of n = 40 male and n = 36 female subjects, allowing us to investigate the influence of endogenous testosterone on structural covariance. Aggressive individuals showed enhanced covariance between left superficial amygdala (SFA) and left dorsal anterior insula (dAI), but lower covariance between right laterobasal amygdala (LBA) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). These structural patterns overlap with functional networks involved in the genesis and regulation of aggressive behavior, respectively. With increasing endogenous testosterone, we observed stronger structural covariance between right centromedial amygdala (CMA) and right medial prefrontal cortex in men and between left CMA and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex in women. These results speak for structural covariance of amygdala subregions as a robust correlate of trait aggression in healthy individuals. Moreover, regions that showed structural covariance with the amygdala modulated by either testosterone or aggression did not overlap, suggesting a complex role of testosterone in human social behavior beyond facilitating aggressiveness.","['Aggression', 'Amygdala', 'Structural covariance', 'Testosterone']",Neuropsychologia,2021-12-14,"[{'lastname': 'Göttlich', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Center of Brain, Behavior and Metabolism (CBBM), University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Buades-Rotger', 'firstname': 'Macià', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Department of Psychology, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiechert', 'firstname': 'Juliana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Beyer', 'firstname': 'Frederike', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Psychology Department, Queen Mary University, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Krämer', 'firstname': 'Ulrike M', 'initials': 'UM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Center of Brain, Behavior and Metabolism (CBBM), University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Department of Psychology, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.

32600454",Impact of Andropause on Multiple Sclerosis.,"Andropause results from the natural decrease in testosterone levels that occurs with age. In contrast to menopause, which is a universal, well-characterized process associated with absolute gonadal failure, andropause ensues after gradual decline of both hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activity, as well as of testicular function, a process which usually develops over a period of many years. Increasing evidence on greater risk of Multiple sclerosis (MS) associated with lower testosterone levels is being reported. Likewise, epidemiological studies have shown a later age of onset of MS in men, relative to women, which could perhaps respond to the decline in protective testosterone levels. In this review, we will discuss the role of androgens in the development and function of the innate and adaptive immune response, as well as in neuroprotective mechanisms relevant to MS. Testosterone effects observed in different animal models and in epidemiological studies in humans will be discussed, as well as their correlation with physical disability and cognitive function levels. Finally, published and ongoing clinical trials exploring the role of androgens, particularly at key stages of sexual maturation, will be reviewed.","['aging', 'andropause', 'multiple sclerosis', 'sex hormones', 'testosterone']",Frontiers in neurology,2021-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Ysrraelit', 'firstname': 'Maria C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Fundación para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurológicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Correale', 'firstname': 'Jorge', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Fundación para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurológicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2021 Ysrraelit and Correale.,"10.3389/fneur.2021.766308

135,34743290,Prostate cancer treatment and the relationship of androgen deprivation therapy to cognitive function.,"Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer in men. For advanced, high risk prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the preferred treatment and can induce remission, but resistance to ADT brings biochemical recurrence and progression of cancer. ADT brings adverse effects such as erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and diminished physical strength. It is estimated that between 25 and 50% of men on ADT manifest some form of cognitive dysfunction that may be self-reported or reported by a family member. There is concern that impaired cognitive function with ADT is due to loss of testosterone support. Testosterone and its metabolites are known to possess neuroprotective properties. While a direct causal relationship between ADT and cognitive decline in prostate cancer patients has not been established, this review describes the controversy surrounding the possible connection between ADT and neurocognitive deterioration. The cellular and molecular mechanisms believed to underlie the protection of neuronal integrity by androgens are discussed. Results from animal models and human clinical studies are presented. Finally, we call attention to lifestyle modifications that may minimize cognitive issues in prostate cancer patients.","['Androgen deprivation therapy', 'Cognitive function', 'Hormonal therapies', 'Management strategies', 'Prostate cancer', 'Testosterone']",Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,2021-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Reiss', 'firstname': 'A B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Research Institute, NYU Long Island School of Medicine, 101 Mineola Boulevard, Suite 4-004, Mineola, NY, 11501, USA.

136,34709216,Aggression and criminality in androgen abusers.,"To systematically review and meta-synthesize current (2019-2021) literature on aggression and criminality in androgen abusers. Results from 13 empirical human studies are discussed.
Some androgen abusers engage in aggressive and criminal behavior. Here, results show positive effects and associations between the administration of androgens and aggression, and descriptions of various patterns and kinds of aggression and criminality in androgen abusers. Still, this positive relationship seems to be mediated by various factors, such as cognition, neurobiology, personality, polypharmacy, and study methods.
The current literature on aggression and criminality in androgen abusers shows methodical diversity and underlines the need to synthesize the current evidence in order to draw overall conclusions as well as identify relevant and important knowledge gaps. On the basis of a systematic literature search, we identified 13 studies and categorized them by methodology. Of the 13 studies, 4 were meta-analyses and systematic reviews, 1 was a randomized controlled trial, 4 were cross-sectional studies, and 4 constituted case reports. Evidence on the relationship between androgen abuse and involvement in aggressive behavior seems to be mediated by cognition, neurobiology, personality, and polypharmacy as well as methodical factors, such as study design, aggression severity, type of measurement, and temporal proximity.

21810696",Androgen abuse and the brain.,"The purpose of this review is to examine the recent evidence regarding the effects of exogenous androgens on the brain. Understanding these effects is of high importance, as the consequences of androgens on the reproductive and endocrine system are well documented, while fewer studies have focused on the neural and cerebral consequences of androgen use.
Supraphysiological doses of androgens have been shown to contribute to neurodegeneration, decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, increased inflammation and decreased neuronal density in animal studies, which may correspond to changes in mood, cognition and aggression. Findings from human studies suggest that similar behavioural and cognitive deficits may occur as a result of prolonged use of androgens. Additional evidence suggests that androgen use, particularly in high doses, may contribute to brain ageing and cerebrovascular problems.
Findings from recent human and animal studies indicate that androgen use likely contributes to brain alterations, which may cause the frequently observed deficits in cognitive and emotional functioning. Although exogenous testosterone in appropriate doses for therapeutic purposes likely have some neurobiological benefits for certain populations, supraphysiological doses may cause multiple mental and physical health problems, indicating a need for additional large-scale studies in humans.",[],"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2021-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Scarth', 'firstname': 'Morgan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, Section for Clinical Addiction Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Bjørnebekk', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

24431386",Testosterone attenuates sevoflurane-induced tau phosphorylation and cognitive impairment in neonatal male mice.,"Sevoflurane anaesthesia induces phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and cognitive impairment in neonatal, but not adult, mice. The underlying mechanisms remain largely to be determined. Sex hormones can be neuroprotective, but little is known about the influence of testosterone on age-dependent anaesthesia effects.
Six- and 60-day-old male mice received anaesthesia with sevoflurane 3% for 2 h daily for 3 days. Morris water maze, immunoassay, immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, nanobeam technology, and electrophysiology were used to assess cognition; testosterone concentrations; tau phosphorylation; glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) activation; binding or interaction between tau and GSK3β; and neuronal activation in mice, cells, and neurones.
Compared with 60-day-old male mice, 6-day-old male mice had lower testosterone concentrations (3.03 [0.29] vs 0.44 [0.12] ng ml
Lower brain testosterone concentrations in neonatal compared with adult male mice contributed to age-dependent tau phosphorylation and cognitive impairment after sevoflurane anaesthesia. Testosterone might attenuate the sevoflurane-induced tau phosphorylation and cognitive impairment by inhibiting the interaction between tau and GSK3β.","['cognitive impairment', 'neuroprotection', 'sevoflurane', 'sex differences', 'tau phosphorylation', 'testosterone']",British journal of anaesthesia,2021-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Yongyan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Anesthesia, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China; Geriatric Anesthesia Research Unit, Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Anesthesia Research Unit, Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Jie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Anesthesiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China; Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Yuanlin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Anesthesia Research Unit, Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yiying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Anesthesia Research Unit, Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Guang', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Soriano', 'firstname': 'Sulpicio G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': ""Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Hua-Jun', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Zhongcong', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Anesthesia Research Unit, Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.

140,34601267,Pubertal exposure to bisphenol-A affects social recognition and arginine vasopressin in the brain of male mice.,"Social recognition is an ability of animals to identify and distinguish conspecifics, which is essential for nearly all social species to establish social relationships. Social recognition provides the basis for a variety of social behaviors. Because of modulated by gonadal hormones, it is possible that social cognition is affected by environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs). In the present study, after being pubertal exposed to bisphenol A (BPA, 0.04, 0.4, and 4 mg/kg) for 18 days, adult male mice did not show significant dishabituation to a novel female stimulus in habituation-dishabituation task. The capacity for discriminating the odors between familiar and novel female urine or between male and female urine was suppressed in BPA-exposed male. In addition, BPA (0.4, 4 mg/kg) decreased the number of immunoreaction of AVP (AVP-ir) neurons in both the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the medial amygdala (MeA), and BPA (0.04, 0.4, 4 mg/kg) reduced the level of V1αR in the lateral septum (LS) of adult male. Further, BPA decreased the levels of testosterone (T) in the brain and androgens receptor (AR) in the LS, the amygdala, and BNST, as well the levels of estrogen receptor α and β (ERα/β) in the amygdala and BNST. These results indicate that pubertal exposure to BPA affected the actions of both androgens and estrogens in the brain and inhibited AVP system of social circuits, and these alterations may be associated with impaired social recognition of adult male mice.","['AVP', 'androgen', 'bisphenol-A', 'estrogen', 'social recognition']",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2021-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jinshan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry and Life Sciences College, Key Laboratory of Wildlife Biotechnology and Conservation and Utilization of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecology, Zhejiang Normal University, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Shizhen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry and Life Sciences College, Key Laboratory of Wildlife Biotechnology and Conservation and Utilization of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecology, Zhejiang Normal University, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Wenshuang', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry and Life Sciences College, Key Laboratory of Wildlife Biotechnology and Conservation and Utilization of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecology, Zhejiang Normal University, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Yufeng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry and Life Sciences College, Key Laboratory of Wildlife Biotechnology and Conservation and Utilization of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecology, Zhejiang Normal University, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Yani', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry and Life Sciences College, Key Laboratory of Wildlife Biotechnology and Conservation and Utilization of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecology, Zhejiang Normal University, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Xiaohong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry and Life Sciences College, Key Laboratory of Wildlife Biotechnology and Conservation and Utilization of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecology, Zhejiang Normal University, PR China.

28469002",The Role of the Hippocampus in the Neuroendocrine Response to Neurobiological Stimuli in Experiment.,"We compared the levels of functional activity of cells in each adrenal zone with blood levels of corticosterone, testosterone, and neuropeptide Y in control and hippocampectomized F1(C57BL/6×DBA/2) mice during modeling of metabolic, motivational, and cognitive tension. The morphofunctional state of the adrenal glands was studied using a new morphometric approach. It was found that hippocampectomy changed the testosterone response to neurobiological stimuli; similar changes were observed in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex producing dehydroepiandrosterone that is involved in the regulation of testosterone secretion. At the same time, hippocampectomy enhanced the response of the peptide hormone; the index of functional activity of chromaffin cells producing this hormone also increased. These findings allow us to put forward a hypothesis that the hippocampus is involved in the regulation of mutual influences of the studied hormones and that it modulates the sensitivity of testosterone and NPY to metabolic and cognitive factors.","['adrenal glands', 'corticosterone', 'hippocampectomy', 'neuropeptide Y', 'testosterone']",Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2021-09-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kondashevskaya', 'firstname': 'M V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of Human Morphology, Moscow, Russia. marivladiko@mail.ru.'}, {'lastname': 'Nikolskaya', 'firstname': 'K A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'M.

25120083","Neurodegenerative Disease: Roles for Sex, Hormones, and Oxidative Stress.","Neurodegenerative diseases cause severe impairments in cognitive and motor function. With an increasing aging population and the onset of these diseases between 50 and 70 years, the consequences are bound to be devastating. While age and longevity are the main risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, sex is also an important risk factor. The characteristic of sex is multifaceted, encompassing sex chromosome complement, sex hormones (estrogens and androgens), and sex hormone receptors. Sex hormone receptors can induce various signaling cascades, ranging from genomic transcription to intracellular signaling pathways that are dependent on the health of the cell. Oxidative stress, associated with aging, can impact the health of the cell. Sex hormones can be neuroprotective under low oxidative stress conditions but not in high oxidative stress conditions. An understudied sex hormone receptor that can induce activation of oxidative stress signaling is the membrane androgen receptor (mAR). mAR can mediate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)-generated oxidative stress that is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease. Further complicating this is that aging can alter sex hormone signaling. Prior to menopause, women experience more estrogens than androgens. During menopause, this sex hormone profile switches in women due to the dramatic ovarian loss of 17β-estradiol with maintained ovarian androgen (testosterone, androstenedione) production. Indeed, aging men have higher estrogens than aging women due to aromatization of androgens to estrogens. Therefore, higher activation of mAR-NOX signaling could occur in menopausal women compared with aged men, mediating the observed sex differences. Understanding of these signaling cascades could provide therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.","['AR45', 'angiotensin', 'estrogen', 'membrane androgen receptor', 'oxidative stress', 'testosterone']",Endocrinology,2021-09-02,"[{'lastname': 'Sumien', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Center for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cunningham', 'firstname': 'J Thomas', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology & Anatomy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Delaney L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Center for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Engelland', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fadeyibi', 'firstname': 'Oluwadarasimi', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Farmer', 'firstname': 'George E', 'initials': 'GE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology & Anatomy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mabry', 'firstname': 'Steve', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mensah-Kane', 'firstname': 'Paapa', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Center for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Trinh', 'firstname': 'Oanh T P', 'initials': 'OTP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Center for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vann', 'firstname': 'Philip H', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Center for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'E Nicole', 'initials': 'EN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cunningham', 'firstname': 'Rebecca L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.'}]",,,,"© The Author(s) 2021.

23348042",Revealing the Influences of Sex Hormones and Sex Differences in Atrial Fibrillation and Vascular Cognitive Impairment.,"The impacts of sex differences on the biology of various organ systems and the influences of sex hormones on modulating health and disease have become increasingly relevant in clinical and biomedical research. A growing body of evidence has recently suggested fundamental sex differences in cardiovascular and cognitive function, including anatomy, pathophysiology, incidence and age of disease onset, symptoms affecting disease diagnosis, disease severity, progression, and treatment responses and outcomes. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is currently recognized as the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia and might contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), including a range of cognitive deficits, from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. In this review, we describe sex-based differences and sex hormone functions in the physiology of the brain and vasculature and the pathophysiology of disorders therein, with special emphasis on AF and VCI. Deciphering how sex hormones and their receptor signaling (estrogen and androgen receptors) potentially impact on sex differences could help to reveal disease links between AF and VCI and identify therapeutic targets that may lead to potentially novel therapeutic interventions early in the disease course of AF and VCI.","['androgen receptor', 'atrial fibrillation', 'estrogen receptor', 'sex differences', 'sex hormones', 'vascular cognitive impairment']",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Ya-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yung-Lung', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'Section of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Hong-Yo', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.\nCenter for Hormone and Reproductive Medicine Research, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms22168776

144,34425226,"Effects of testosterone administration on fMRI responses to executive function, aggressive behavior, and emotion processing tasks during severe exercise- and diet-induced energy deficit.","Clinical administration of testosterone is widely used due to a variety of claimed physical and cognitive benefits. Testosterone administration is associated with enhanced brain and cognitive function, as well as mood, in energy-balanced males, although such relationships are controversial. However, the effects of testosterone administration on the brains of energy-deficient males, whose testosterone concentrations are likely to be well below normal, have not been investigated.
This study collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 50 non-obese young men before (PRE) and shortly after (POST) 28 days of severe exercise-and-diet-induced energy deficit during which testosterone (200 mg testosterone enanthate per week in sesame oil, TEST) or placebo (sesame seed oil only, PLA) were administered. Scans were also collected after a post-energy-deficit weight regain period (REC). Participants completed five fMRI tasks that assessed aspects of: 1) executive function (Attention Network Task or ANT; Multi-Source Interference Task or MSIT; AXE Continuous Processing Task or AXCPT); 2) aggressive behavior (Provoked Aggression Task or AGG); and 3) latent emotion processing (Emotional Face Processing or EMO).
Changes over time in task-related fMRI activation in a priori defined task-critical brain regions during performance of 2 out of 5 tasks were significantly different between TEST and PLA, with TEST showing greater levels of activation during ANT in the right anterior cingulate gyrus at POST and during MSIT in several brain regions at REC. Changes over time in objective task performance were not statistically significant; testosterone-treated volunteers had greater self-reported anger during AGG at POST.
Testosterone administration can alter some aspects of brain function during severe energy deficit and increase levels of anger.","['Cognition', 'Energy deficit', 'Testosterone', 'fMRI']",NeuroImage,2021-08-24,"[{'lastname': 'Carmichael', 'firstname': 'Owen T', 'initials': 'OT', 'affiliation': 'Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA.

31622374",The enhancing effects of testosterone in exposure treatment for social anxiety disorder: a randomized proof-of-concept trial.,"Individuals with a social anxiety disorder (SAD) show hypofunctioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which is linked to social fear and avoidance behavior. As testosterone administration has been shown to facilitate social-approach behavior in this population, it may enhance the effectiveness of exposure treatment. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed a randomized clinical assay in which 55 women diagnosed with SAD received two exposure therapy sessions. Session 1 was supplemented with either testosterone (0.50 mg) or placebo. Next, transfer effects of testosterone augmentation on within-session subjective fear responses and SAD symptom severity were assessed during a second, unenhanced exposure session (session 2) and at a 1-month follow-up, respectively. The participants having received testosterone showed a more reactive fear pattern, with higher peaks and steeper reductions in fear levels in session 2. Post-hoc exploration of moderating effects of endogenous testosterone levels, revealed that this pattern was specific for women with high basal testosterone, both in the augmented and in the transfer session. In contrast, the participants with low endogenous testosterone showed reduced peak fear levels throughout session 1, again with transfer to the unenhanced session. Testosterone did not significantly affect self-reported anxiety. The effects of testosterone supplementation on fear levels show transfer to non-enhanced exposure, with effects being modulated by endogenous testosterone. These first preliminary results indicate that testosterone may act on important fear mechanisms during exposure, providing the empirical groundwork for further exploration of multi-session testosterone-enhanced exposure treatment for SAD.",[],Translational psychiatry,2021-08-22,"[{'lastname': 'Hutschemaekers', 'firstname': 'Moniek H M', 'initials': 'MHM', 'affiliation': 'Overwaal Centre of Expertise for Anxiety Disorders, OCD and PTSD, Pro Persona Institute for Integrated Mental Health Care, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.hutschemaekers@bsi.ru.nl.\nBehavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.hutschemaekers@bsi.ru.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'de Kleine', 'firstname': 'Rianne A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hendriks', 'firstname': 'Gert-Jan', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Overwaal Centre of Expertise for Anxiety Disorders, OCD and PTSD, Pro Persona Institute for Integrated Mental Health Care, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nBehavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Kampman', 'firstname': 'Mirjam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Overwaal Centre of Expertise for Anxiety Disorders, OCD and PTSD, Pro Persona Institute for Integrated Mental Health Care, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nBehavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Roelofs', 'firstname': 'Karin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nDonders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Centre for Neuroimaging, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,© 2021.

29667159",A 2-year prospective analysis of insomnia as a mediator of the relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and perceived cognitive function in men with prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may affect cognitive function in men with prostate cancer (PCa). This study examined whether insomnia symptoms mediate the relationship between ADT and perceived cognitive function and whether depressive symptoms, fatigue severity, and physical activity moderate the strength of this relationship.
This was a prospective study of ADT recipients (n = 83) who were matched with control patients with PCa who were not on ADT (n = 92) and with controls with no history of cancer (n = 112) over a 2-year follow-up period. Perceived cognitive function and satisfaction were assessed with the Everyday Cognition Scale. Insomnia was assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. Multilevel mediation analyses were conducted to estimate the indirect effect of ADT on perceived cognitive function through insomnia symptoms. Exploratory moderated mediation analyses assessed whether the indirect effect of ADT on perceived cognitive function through insomnia symptoms was dependent on levels of fatigue, depression, or physical activity.
Insomnia symptoms significantly mediated the relationship between receipt of ADT and perceived cognitive function (P < .001) and satisfaction with cognition (P < .001) after controlling for comorbidities. Men with greater fatigue had a more pronounced association of ADT with insomnia severity. Men with greater depressive symptoms had a stronger association between insomnia severity and worse perceived cognitive function. Physical activity was not a significant moderator of the relationship between ADT and perceived cognitive function.
Insomnia influenced the relationship between ADT and perceived cognitive abilities. Interventions to address insomnia, fatigue, and depression may improve perceived cognitive function.","['androgen deprivation therapy', 'cognitive function', 'depression', 'fatigue', 'insomnia symptoms', 'physical activity', 'prostate cancer']",Cancer,2021-08-20,"[{'lastname': 'Garland', 'firstname': 'Sheila N', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.\nDiscipline of Oncology, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Savard', 'firstname': 'Josée', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Université Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.\nLaval University Cancer Research Center, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Eisel', 'firstname': 'Sarah L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Wassersug', 'firstname': 'Richard J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Rockwood', 'firstname': 'Nicholas J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Behavioral Health, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Thoms', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Discipline of Oncology, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Jim', 'firstname': 'Heather S L', 'initials': 'HSL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Brian D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}]",,,Insomnia symptoms significantly mediated the relationship between receipt of ADT and perceived cognitive function (P < .001) and satisfaction with cognition (P < .001) after controlling for comorbidities.

147,34407462,Association between nandrolone and behavioral alterations: A systematic review of preclinical studies.,"In recent years the expanding misuse of Nandrolone among non-athletes, particularly adolescent males is a prevalent global concern due to its adverse effects. This article provides a summary of the experimental studies to clarify the relationship between Nandrolone exposure and behavioral and cognitive performances.
The present systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase and ScienceDirect databases, from 2000 to 2020, using the following key terms: Nandrolone AND Cognition, Nandrolone AND Learning, Nandrolone AND Memory, Nandrolone AND (Synaptic plasticity or Hippocampal synaptic plasticity), Nandrolone AND (Aggression or Aggressive-like behavior), Nandrolone AND (Anxiety or Anxiety-like behavior), Nandrolone AND (Depression or Depressive-like behavior).
33 qualified papers were selected from the 2498 sources found. Of the 33 cases, 32 (96.97%) were males while only 1 (3.03%) was female and male. From 33 selected articles 8 reported studies were related to spatial memory, 2 reported studies were related to avoidance memory, 11 studies reported information on synaptic plasticity, 11 reported studies were related to aggressive behavior, 8 reported studies were related to aggressive behavior and 6 reported studies were related to depression.
Nandrolone can change spatial ability, avoidance memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Also, Nandrolone exposure produces variable effects on behavioral function such as aggression, depression and anxiety. This despite the fact that the results are contradictory. These discrepancies might be due to the differences in sex, age, dosage and treatment duration, and administration route. However, the negative results are more common than the published positive ones.","['Aggression', 'Anxiety', 'Avoidance memory', 'Depression', 'Nandrolone', 'Spatial memory', 'Synaptic plasticity']",Steroids,2021-08-19,"[{'lastname': 'Niromand', 'firstname': 'Elham', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Health Technology Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Javanmardy', 'firstname': 'Setareh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Health Technology Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Salimi', 'firstname': 'Zahra', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Health Technology Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; Department of Physiology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Zarei', 'firstname': 'Fatemeh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Health Technology Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; Department of Physiology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.

31063740","Structural Neuroimaging Findings Related to Adult Non-CNS Cancer and Treatment: Review, Integration, and Implications for Treatment of Cognitive Dysfunction.","Cancer- and treatment-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) is a common challenge faced by patients diagnosed with non-central nervous system (CNS) cancer. It has become increasingly recognized that multiple factors likely play a role in these symptoms, including the cancer disease process, systemic treatments (e.g., chemotherapy and endocrine therapies), and risk factors that may predispose an individual to both cancer and cognitive dysfunction. As the field has evolved, advanced neuroimaging techniques have been applied to better understand the neural correlates of CRCD. This review focuses on structural neuroimaging findings related to CRCD in adult non-CNS cancer populations, including examination of gray matter volume/density and white matter integrity differences between cancer patients and comparison groups, as well as emerging findings regarding structural network abnormalities. Overall, this literature has demonstrated consistent findings of reduced gray matter volume/density and white matter integrity in cancer patients relative to comparison groups. These are most prominent in individuals treated with chemotherapy, though alterations have also been noted in those treated with anti-estrogen and androgen-deprivation therapies. Alterations in gray and white matter structural network connectivity have also been identified. These structural abnormalities have been observed most prominently in frontal and temporal brain regions, and have been shown to correlate with subjective and objective cognitive function, as well as with physiological and clinical variables, helping to inform understanding of CRCD mechanisms. To date, however, structural neuroimaging techniques have not been utilized in systematic studies of potential CRCD treatments, suggesting a potentially fruitful avenue for future research.","['Brain structure', 'Chemotherapy', 'Cognition', 'Neuroimaging', 'Non-CNS cancer']",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2021-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'McDonald', 'firstname': 'Brenna C', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center, 355 W. 16th St., GH Suite 4100, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA. mcdonalb@iupui.edu.'}]",,,,"© 2021.

30291251","Cognitive changes and brain connectomes, endocrine status, and risk genotypes in testicular cancer patients-A prospective controlled study.","Previous research has indicated cognitive decline (CD) among testicular cancer patients (TCPs), even in the absence of chemotherapy, but little is known about the underlying pathophysiology. The present study assessed changes in cognitive functions and structural brain connectomes in TCPs and explored the associations between cognitive changes and endocrine status and hypothesized risk genotypes.
Thirty-eight newly orchiectomized TCPs and 21 healthy controls (HCs) comparable to TCPs in terms of age and years of education underwent neuropsychological testing, structural MRI, and a biological assessment at baseline and 6 months later. Cognitive change was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery and determined using a standardized regression-based approach, with substantial change defined as z-scores ≤-1.64 or ≥1.64. MRI scans and graph theory were used to evaluate changes in structural brain connectomes. The associations of cognitive changes with testosterone levels, androgen receptor gene (AR) CAG repeat length, and genotypes (APOE, COMT, and BDNF) were explored.
Compared with HCs, TCPs showed higher rates of substantial decline on processing speed and visuospatial ability and higher rates of substantial improvement on verbal recall and visuospatial learning (p < 0.05; OR = 8.15-15.84). Brain network analysis indicated bilateral thalamic changes in node degree in HCs, but not in TCPs (p < 0.01). In TCPs, higher baseline testosterone levels predicted decline in verbal memory (p < 0.05). No effects were found for AR CAG repeat length, APOE, COMT, or BDNF.
The present study confirms previous findings of domain-specific CD in TCPs following orchiectomy, but also points to domain-specific improvements. The results do not indicate changes in brain connectomes or endocrine status to be the main drivers of CD. Further studies evaluating the mechanisms underlying CD in TCPs, including the possible role of the dynamics of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, are warranted.","['clinical cancer research', 'genetic variants', 'survival', 'urological oncology']",Cancer medicine,2021-08-15,"[{'lastname': 'Buskbjerg', 'firstname': 'Cecilie R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Unit for Psychooncology and Health Psychology, Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Amidi', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Unit for Psychooncology and Health Psychology, Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Agerbaek', 'firstname': 'Mads', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Gravholt', 'firstname': 'Claus H', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.\nDepartment of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Hosseini', 'firstname': 'Sm Hadi', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zachariae', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Unit for Psychooncology and Health Psychology, Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.\nDepartment of Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.'}]",,,"Compared with HCs, TCPs showed higher rates of substantial decline on processing speed and visuospatial ability and higher rates of substantial improvement on verbal recall and visuospatial learning (p < 0.05; OR = 8.15-15.84).

33150931",Cognitive response to testosterone replacement added to intensive lifestyle intervention in older men with obesity and hypogonadism: prespecified secondary analyses of a randomized clinical trial.,"Both obesity and hypogonadism are common in older men which could additively exacerbate age-related declines in cognitive function. However, little is known about the effects of lifestyle intervention plus testosterone replacement therapy in this population.
In this secondary analysis of the LITROS (Lifestyle Intervention and Testosterone Replacement in Obese Seniors) trial, we examined whether testosterone replacement therapy would improve cognitive function when added to intensive lifestyle intervention in older men with obesity and hypogonadism.
Eighty-three older, obese hypogonadal men with frailty were randomly assigned to lifestyle therapy (weight management and exercise training) plus testosterone (LT + Test) or lifestyle therapy plus placebo (LT + Pbo) for 6 mo. For this report, the primary outcome was change in the global cognition composite z score. Secondary outcomes included changes in z score subcomponents: attention/information processing, memory, executive function, and language. Changes between groups were analyzed using mixed-model repeated-measures ANCOVAs following the intention-to-treat principle.
Global cognition z score increased more in the LT + Test than in the LT + Pbo group (mean change: 0.49 compared with 0.21; between-group difference: -0.28; 95% CI: -0.45, -0.11; Cohen's d = 0.74). Moreover, attention/information z score and memory z score increased more in the LT + Test than in the LT + Pbo group (mean change: 0.55 compared with 0.23; between-group difference: -0.32; 95% CI: -0.55, -0.09; Cohen's d = 0.49 and mean change: 0.90 compared with 0.37; between-group difference: -0.53; 95% CI: -0.93, -0.13; Cohen's d = 1.43, respectively). Multiple regression analyses showed that changes in peak oxygen consumption, strength, total testosterone, and luteinizing hormone were independent predictors of the improvement in global cognition (R2 = 0.38; P < 0.001).
These findings suggest that in the high-risk population of older men with obesity and hypogonadism, testosterone replacement may improve cognitive function with lifestyle behaviors controlled via lifestyle intervention therapy.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02367105.","['adiposity', 'aging', 'androgens', 'cognition', 'diet', 'exercise', 'frailty', 'obesity']",The American journal of clinical nutrition,2021-08-11,"[{'lastname': 'Gregori', 'firstname': 'Giulia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research on Inflammatory Diseases, Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Celli', 'firstname': 'Alessandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research on Inflammatory Diseases, Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnouin', 'firstname': 'Yoann', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research on Inflammatory Diseases, Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Paudyal', 'firstname': 'Arjun', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research on Inflammatory Diseases, Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Armamento-Villareal', 'firstname': 'Reina', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research on Inflammatory Diseases, Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Napoli', 'firstname': 'Nicola', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Qualls', 'firstname': 'Clifford', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Villareal', 'firstname': 'Dennis T', 'initials': 'DT', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational Research on Inflammatory Diseases, Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}]",,,"Global cognition z score increased more in the LT + Test than in the LT + Pbo group (mean change: 0.49 compared with 0.21; between-group difference: -0.28; 95% CI: -0.45, -0.11; Cohen's d = 0.74).

151,34370516,How Would You Manage This Male Patient With Hypogonadism? : Grand Rounds Discussion From Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.,"Male hypogonadism is defined as an abnormally low serum testosterone concentration or sperm count. As men age, often in the context of obesity and other comorbid conditions, serum testosterone levels may decrease. Normalizing serum testosterone levels in male adults with hypogonadism may improve symptoms related to androgen deficiency, but controversies exist regarding the long-term benefits and risks of hormone supplementation in this setting. In 2020, the American College of Physicians published a clinical guideline for the use of testosterone supplementation in adult men based on a systematic review of available evidence. Among their recommendations were that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function and not initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition. Here, two clinicians with expertise in this area, one a generalist and the other an endocrinologist, debate the management of a patient with sexual symptoms and a low serum testosterone level. They discuss the diagnosis of male hypogonadism, the indications for testosterone therapy, its potential benefits and risks, how it should be monitored, and how long it should be continued.",[],Annals of internal medicine,2021-08-10,"[{'lastname': 'Libman', 'firstname': 'Howard', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (H.L., M.L.C., M.S.I., G.W.S.).'}, {'lastname': 'Cohen', 'firstname': 'Marc L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (H.L., M.L.C., M.S.I., G.W.S.).'}, {'lastname': 'Irwig', 'firstname': 'Michael S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (H.L., M.L.C., M.S.I., G.W.S.).'}, {'lastname': 'Smetana', 'firstname': 'Gerald W', 'initials': 'GW', 'affiliation': 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (H.L., M.L.C., M.S.I., G.W.S.).'}]",,,,,10.7326/M21-2524,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe0c1d0>,,,,,,
152,34333317,Pregnancy-related hormones and COMT genotype: Associations with maternal working memory.,"Women experience different degrees of subjective cognitive changes during pregnancy. The exact mechanism underlying these changes is unknown, although endocrine alterations and genetics may be contributing factors. We investigated whether multiple pregnancy-related hormones were associated with working memory function assessed with the Digit Span Test (DST) in late pregnancy. Moreover, we examined whether the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype, previously related to working memory, was an effect modifier in this association. In this population-based panel study, we recorded psychiatric history, medication use, socio-demographic characteristics, and psychological well-being, gathered blood and saliva samples, and administered the DST at gestational weeks 35-39 (N = 216). We conducted multivariate linear regressions with DST as outcome, with different hormones and COMT genotype, adjusting for covariates including maternal age, BMI, education, depressive symptoms, and parity. We repeated these analyses excluding women with elevated depressive symptoms. Higher DST total scores were associated with increased free estradiol concentrations (B = 0.01, p = 0.03; B = 0.01, p = 0.02) in all participants and in participants without depressive symptoms, respectively, whereas DST forward was positively associated with free estradiol only in women without depressive symptoms (B = 0.01, p = 0.04). Lower total testosterone concentrations (B = -0.03, p = 0.01) enhanced DST backward performance in non-depressed women. Maternal higher education was significantly associated with the DST subscales in all participants. No significant differences emerged when considering the COMT genotype. Our results suggest differential associations of free estradiol and total testosterone levels with working memory function in late pregnancy.","['COMT genotype', 'Cortisol', 'Digit Span Test', 'Estradiol', 'Pregnancy', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-08-02,"[{'lastname': 'Amiel Castro', 'firstname': 'Rita', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich, Institute of Psychology, Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Binzmühlestrasse 14/26, 8050 Zurich, Switzerland.

154,34321135,Developmental variation in testosterone:cortisol ratio alters cortical- and amygdala-based cognitive processes.,"Testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) are the end products of neuroendocrine axes that interact with the process of shaping brain structure and function. Relative levels of T:C (TC ratio) may alter prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity in adulthood. What remains unclear is whether TC-related effects are rooted to childhood and adolescence. We used a healthy cohort of 4-22-year-olds to test for associations between TC ratios, brain structure (amygdala volume, cortical thickness (CTh), and their coordinated growth), as well as cognitive and behavioral development. We found greater TC ratios to be associated with the growth of specific brain structures: 1) parietal CTh; 2) covariance of the amygdala with CTh in visual and somatosensory areas. These brain parameters were in turn associated with lower verbal/executive function and higher spatial working memory. In sum, individual TC profiles may confer a particular brain phenotype and set of cognitive strengths and vulnerabilities, prior to adulthood.","['Androgens', 'TC ratio', 'adolescence', 'brain development', 'cognition']",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2021-07-30,"[{'lastname': 'Lew', 'firstname': 'Jimin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Integrated Program in Neuroscience, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A2B4.\nResearch Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A3J1.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Sherri Lee', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A3J1.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A1A1.'}, {'lastname': 'Caccese', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A3J1.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A1A1.'}, {'lastname': 'Orfi', 'firstname': 'Isobel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A3J1.'}, {'lastname': 'Little', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A3J1.'}, {'lastname': 'Botteron', 'firstname': 'Kelly N', 'initials': 'KN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO63110, USA.\nBrain Development Cooperative Group, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McCracken', 'firstname': 'James T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Brain Development Cooperative Group, USA.\nDepartment of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of California in Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA90024, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Tuong-Vi', 'initials': 'TV', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A3J1.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A1A1.\nDepartment of Obstetrics-Gynecology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A3J1.'}]",,,,,10.1017/S2040174421000362,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dbe05db0>,,,,,,

Despite an extensive body of research on the underlying psychological and cultural factors regulating competitive behavior, the role of biological factors remains poorly understood. Extant research has focused primarily on sex hormones, with equivocal findings. Here, we examined if intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) - a key regulator of human social behavior and cognition - interacts with changes in endogenous testosterone (T) levels in regulating the willingness to engage in competition. In a double-blind placebo-control design, 204 subjects (102 females) self-administrated OT or placebo and were assessed for their willingness to compete via an extensively-validated economic laboratory competition paradigm, in which, before completing a set of incentivized arithmetic tasks, subjects are asked to decide what percentage of their payoffs will be based on tournament paying-scheme. Salivary T concentrations (n = 197) were measured throughout the task to assess endogenous reactivity. Under both OT and placebo, T-reactivity during competition was not associated with competitiveness in females. However, in males, the association between T-reactivity and competitiveness was OT-dependent. That is, males under placebo demonstrated a positive correlation between T-reactivity and the willingness to engage in competition, while no association was observed in males receiving OT. The interaction between OT, T-reactivity, and sex on competitive preferences remained significant even after controlling for potential mediators such as performance, self-confidence, and risk-aversion, suggesting that this three-way interaction effect was specific to competitive motivation rather than to other generalized processes. These findings deepen our understanding of the biological processes underlying human preferences for competition and extend the evidence base for the interplay between hormones in affecting human social behavior.","['Competitiveness', 'Neurohormones', 'Oxytocin', 'Sex differences', 'Testosterone reactivity']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Cherki', 'firstname': 'Boaz R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': 'Psychology Department, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus Campus, Mt.

9881538",Free testosterone is related to aspects of cognitive function in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Evidence suggests impairment in aspects of cognitive function in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Direct effects of raised testosterone levels associated with PCOS are a potential mechanism. We aimed to explore the relationship between testosterone levels and cognitive functioning in women. Women with a range of testosterone levels, including women with PCOS, were recruited. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by self-report. Participants underwent a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests assessing psychomotor speed, visuospatial learning and memory, verbal learning and memory, and executive function. Free testosterone serum levels were assessed. All measures were completed at the same time point. Correlation analysis (Spearman's Rho) was used to explore associations between free testosterone and cognitive test variables. Eighty-one women were recruited, with 40 meeting diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Free testosterone was normally distributed, with significant overlap between women with PCOS and controls. Mean depressive and anxiety symptoms were in the mild range. Higher free testosterone levels were significantly correlated with poorer performance on measures assessing psychomotor speed and visuospatial learning. These significant correlations remained after adjusting for confounders (premorbid verbal IQ, depressive, and anxiety symptoms). Higher free testosterone levels in women were associated with poorer cognitive function, specifically psychomotor speed and visuospatial learning. Women with PCOS and raised free testosterone levels may experience impairment in these aspects of cognitive function which are not accounted for by mood or anxiety symptoms.","['Cognitive function', 'Free testosterone', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome', 'Psychomotor speed', 'Visuospatial learning']",Archives of women's mental health,2021-06-28,"[{'lastname': 'Sukhapure', 'firstname': 'Mayouri', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Eggleston', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand. kate.eggleston@otago.ac.nz.\nSpecialist Mental Health Services, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand. kate.eggleston@otago.ac.nz.'}, {'lastname': 'Douglas', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Fenton', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Endocrinology, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.\nOxford Women's Health, Christchurch, New Zealand.""}, {'lastname': 'Frampton', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Porter', 'firstname': 'Richard J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand.\nSpecialist Mental Health Services, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.'}]",,,,"© 2021.

157,34140090,Testosterone Disorders and Male Hypogonadism in Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes substantial alterations in the male endocrine system, which affect puberty, libido, and sexual function. A major effect of CKD is a reduction in testosterone levels because of both primary and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. In addition to impairment of pubertal growth and sexual maturation in children with CKD, clinical evidence suggests that uremic hypogonadism strongly contributes to several CKD complications, including erectile dysfunction, muscle wasting and frailty, anemia, decreased bone mineralization, depression, and cognitive impairment. This review focuses on a reappraisal of the physiologic role of testosterone, with an emphasis on the hypogonadal condition linked to CKD and its complications.","['Androgen', 'CKD', 'cardiovascular disease', 'frailty', 'protein-energy wasting']",Seminars in nephrology,2021-06-19,"[{'lastname': 'Garibotto', 'firstname': 'Giacomo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation, University of Genova, Genova, Italy Department of Internal Medicine, Istituto di Ricerca a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova Italy.

33049345",Testosterone ameliorates age-related brain mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Brain mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced testosterone levels are common features of aging in men. Although evidence suggests that the two phenomena are interrelated, it is unclear whether testosterone supplementation ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction in the aging male brain. Here, we show that testosterone supplementation significantly alleviates exploratory behavioral deficits and oxidative damage in the substantia nigra and hippocampus of aging male rats. These effects were consistent with improved mitochondrial function, reflected by testosterone-induced increases in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), antioxidant enzyme (GSH-PX, catalase, and Mn-SOD) expression/activity, and mitochondrial respiratory complex activities in both brain regions. Furthermore, elevated PGC-1α, NRF-1, and TFAM expression (suggestive of enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis), increased citrate synthase activity, mtDNA copy number, and ND1, COX1, and ATP6 expression (indicative of increased mitochondrial content), as well as increased PINK1/Parkin and decreased P62 expression (suggesting mitophagy activation), were detected in the substantial nigra and hippocampus of aged male rats after testosterone supplementation. These findings suggest that testosterone supplementation may be a viable approach to ameliorating brain mitochondrial dysfunction and thus prevent or treat cognitive-behavioral deficits and neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging.","['aged male rats', 'antioxidative capacity', 'mitochondrial biogenesis', 'mitochondrial function', 'testosterone']",Aging,2021-06-18,"[{'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'Wensheng', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Tianyun', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Yunxiao', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Guoliang', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ji', 'firstname': 'Xiaoming', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Xu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Hebei Laboratory Animal Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Geming', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.\nNeuroscience Research Center, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.\nHebei Key Laboratory of Forensic Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.'}]",,,,,"10.18632/aging.203153

32605859",Effect of androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive functioning in men with prostate cancer: A systematic review.,"The objective of this study was to review publications assessing cognitive functioning in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy. We conducted a systematic review of the literature published in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO up to February 2020. A total of 31 studies were included. Half of the studies (n = 16) demonstrated that androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate carcinoma did not result in a negative effect on cognitive functioning, however, still a substantial proportion of the studies (n = 11) reported a negative effect on cognitive functioning. In four studies the results were inconclusive. In the three studies using additional functional magnetic resonance imaging, no significant effect on neuropsychological tests was found, but grey matter volume, brain activity, and brain connectivity were affected. Given the substantial number of studies showing a significant negative effect of androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive functioning, clinicians should be aware of this side effect. Furthermore, future research should focus on the further examination of brain characteristics using functional magnetic resonance imaging, since these techniques might be more sensitive in detecting brain abnormalities as a result of androgen deprivation therapy.","['androgen deprivation therapy', 'cognitive functioning']",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,2021-06-16,"[{'lastname': 'Andela', 'firstname': 'Cornelie D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Matte', 'firstname': 'Rafil', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Jazet', 'firstname': 'Ingrid M', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Zonneveld', 'firstname': 'Willemijn Cg', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Schoones', 'firstname': 'Jan W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Walaeus Library, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Meinders', 'firstname': 'A Edo', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,"© 2021 The Authors.

160,34089835,Metabolism of oral turinabol by the human brain cholesterol 24-hydroxylase CYP46A1.,"The human microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP46A1 plays a crucial role in cholesterol elimination from the brain. It performs a 24-hydroxylation of cholesterol and is of outstanding significance for memory and cognition. This study demonstrates the catalytic activity of human CYP46A1 towards an anabolic androgenic steroid, oral turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone, 4-chloro-17β-dihydroxy,17α-methylandrosta-1,4-dien-3-one), which is a doping substance. CYP46A1 is the first human microsomal steroid-converting P450 showing activity towards this xenobiotic compound. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of oral turinabol on the cholesterol conversion has been investigated in vitro demonstrating competition of the two substrates on the active site of CYP46A1 which might be of importance for potential pathogenic effects of oral turinabol. The conversion of oral turinabol was found to be selective resulting in the formation of only one product, as shown by HPLC analysis. To produce sufficient amounts of this product for NMR analysis, a system expressing human full-length CYP46A1 and CPR on a bicistronic vector was successfully developed realizing the selective cholesterol 24-hydroxylation in E. coli in mg amounts. Using this novel whole-cell system, the conversion of oral turinabol was performed and the product of this conversion by CYP46A1 was isolated and identified as 16β-hydroxy oral turinabol by NMR.","['16-Hydroxy oral turinabol', 'Brain', 'CYP46A1', 'Cholesterol metabolism', 'Dehydrochloromethyltestosterone', 'Hydroxylase']",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2021-06-06,"[{'lastname': 'Putkaradze', 'firstname': 'Natalia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biochemistry, Saarland University, D-66123, Saarbruecken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hartz', 'firstname': 'Philip', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biochemistry, Saarland University, D-66123, Saarbruecken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hutter', 'firstname': 'Michael C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Center for Bioinformatics, Saarland University, D-66123, Saarbruecken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zapp', 'firstname': 'Josef', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, D-66123, Saarbruecken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Thevis', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biochemistry, German Sport University Cologne, D-50933, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bernhardt', 'firstname': 'Rita', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biochemistry, Saarland University, D-66123, Saarbruecken, Germany.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common sex chromosomal disorder and a frequent cause of male hypogonadism. Psychological and cognitive aspects are quite typical in KS and have been linked to ED, while the role of testosterone (T) levels in sexual function of KS subjects has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the role of hormonal disturbances in erectile function of subjects with KS. We conducted a retrospective study involving 52 Klinefelter patients newly diagnosed who never received androgen replacing therapy. All the subjects underwent medical history, accurate physical examination, and blood tests.

11238542",Altered Spontaneous Brain Activity in Women During Menopause Transition and Its Association With Cognitive Function and Serum Estradiol Level.,"Serum hormone deficiencies during menopause transition may affect spontaneous brain activity and global cognition. The purpose of this study was to explore the differences in spontaneous brain activity between premenopausal and perimenopausal women, and to investigate the associations between spontaneous brain activity, serum hormone levels and global cognition.
Thirty-two premenopausal women (47.75 ± 1.55 years) and twenty-five perimenopausal women (51.60 ± 1.63 years) underwent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scan. Clinical information including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), levels of estradiol (E2), free testosterone, progesterone, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were measured. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to evaluate spontaneous brain activity alterations between perimenopausal and premenopausal women. Correlation analysis was used to investigate the associations between brain functional alterations and clinical measures in perimenopausal group.
The results demonstrated increased ReHo value in the right lingual gyrus (LG) and decreased ReHo value in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in perimenopausal women compared with premenopausal women. In perimenopausal group, ReHo of the right LG showed a negative correlation with level of E2 (r = -0.586, p = 0.002), ReHo of the right SFG showed a positive correlation with level of E2 (r = 0.470, p = 0.018) and MMSE (r = 0.614, p = 0.001).
The results demonstrated that women approaching menopause suffered from altered functions in brain regions related to cognitive function, working memory, the results also revealed a direct association between levels of E2 and brain functions in perimenopausal women.","['ReHo', 'estradiol', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'menopause', 'spontaneous brain activity']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-05-29,"[{'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Lemin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Precision Instruments and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Radiology, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Taian, China.\nAcademy of Medical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Taian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qiu', 'firstname': 'Jianfeng', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Taian, China.\nScience and Technology Innovation Center, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'An', 'firstname': 'Xingwei', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Academy of Medical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Weizhao', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Taian, China.\nScience and Technology Innovation Center, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.'}]",,,"The results demonstrated increased ReHo value in the right lingual gyrus (LG) and decreased ReHo value in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in perimenopausal women compared with premenopausal women.

24856205",Oral contraceptive use is not related to gender self-concept.,"Oral contraceptive (OC) use is a valuable and underutilized natural experiment for examining exogenous hormone effects on aspects of cognition and behavior, especially aspects that show sex or gender differences. OC use, however, is not randomly assigned; women who use OCs may systematically differ from non-users for gender-linked reasons that potentially confound investigations of the pharmacokinetic effects of OCs. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to investigate whether OC users and non-users differ in gender self-concepts, as sociocultural factors might influence who uses OCs and why. A secondary aim was to examine whether OC users of different pill formulations differ in gender self-concept. Multivariate analyses of covariance (controlling for age) on a large sample of 395 young adult women revealed no significant differences between OC users (n = 247) and non-users (n = 148) in four aspects of gender self-concept (expressivity, instrumentality, femininity, and masculinity), with univariate effect sizes averaging d = 0.07. Moreover, inferences about group differences did not change when considering sociocultural factors (i.e., reason for OC use) or pharmacokinetic properties of the pills (i.e., androgenicity). Thus, findings indicate that differences in gender self-concept do not underlie OC use and non-use, and that the androgenicity of different OC formulations does not impact gender self-concept. Taken together, findings also highlight the specificity of exogenous ovarian hormone influences, as there are documented effects on cognition but not on personal characteristics, such as gender self-concept.","['Androgens', 'Expressivity', 'Femininity', 'Hormonal contraceptives', 'Instrumentality', 'Masculinity', 'Ovarian hormones']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-05-25,"[{'lastname': 'Nielson', 'firstname': 'Matthew G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Psychology Department, University of Michigan, 2227 East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Beltz', 'firstname': 'Adriene M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Psychology Department, University of Michigan, 2227 East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.

2479726",Testosterone Treatment Mimics Seasonal Downregulation of Dopamine Innervation in the Auditory System of Female Midshipman Fish.,"In seasonally breeding vertebrates, hormones coordinate changes in nervous system structure and function to facilitate reproductive readiness and success. Steroid hormones often exert their effects indirectly via regulation of neuromodulators, which in turn can coordinate the modulation of sensory input with appropriate motor output. Female plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) undergo increased peripheral auditory sensitivity in time for the summer breeding season, improving their ability to detect mates, which is regulated by steroid hormones. Reproductive females also show differences in catecholaminergic innervation of auditory circuitry compared with winter, non-reproductive females as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholaminergic synthesis. Importantly, catecholaminergic input to the inner ear from a dopaminergic-specific forebrain nucleus is decreased in the summer and dopamine inhibits the sensitivity of the inner ear, suggesting that gonadal steroids may alter auditory sensitivity by regulating dopamine innervation. In this study, we gonadectomized non-reproductive females, implanted them with estradiol (E2) or testosterone (T), and measured TH immunoreactive (TH-ir) fibers in auditory nuclei where catecholaminergic innervation was previously shown to be seasonally plastic. We found that treatment with T, but not E2, reduced TH-ir innervation in the auditory hindbrain. T-treatment also reduced TH-ir fibers in the forebrain dopaminergic cell group that projects to the inner ear, and likely to the auditory hindbrain. Higher T plasma in the treatment group was correlated with reduced-ir TH terminals in the inner ear. These T-treatment induced changes in TH-ir fibers mimic the seasonal downregulation of dopamine in the midshipman inner ear and provide evidence that steroid hormone regulation of peripheral auditory sensitivity is mediated, in part, by dopamine.",[],Integrative and comparative biology,2021-05-12,"[{'lastname': 'Perelmuter', 'firstname': 'Jonathan T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.\nDepartment of Biology, Brooklyn College, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.\nPsychology Subprogram in Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hom', 'firstname': 'Kelsey N', 'initials': 'KN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Brooklyn College, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.\nDoctoral Program in Biology, The Graduate Center, The City University of New York, New York, NY, USA.\nBiology Subprogram in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behavior, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohr', 'firstname': 'Robert A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Demis', 'firstname': 'Lina', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Brooklyn College, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Spencer', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Brooklyn College, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chernenko', 'firstname': 'Alena', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Brooklyn College, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Timothy', 'firstname': 'Miky', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Brooklyn College, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Middleton', 'firstname': 'Mollie A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sisneros', 'firstname': 'Joseph A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.\nDepartment of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.\nVirginia Merrill Bloedel Hearing Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Forlano', 'firstname': 'Paul M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Brooklyn College, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.\nPsychology Subprogram in Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA.\nBiology Subprogram in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behavior, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA.\nBiology Subprogram in Neuroscience, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA.\nAquatic Research and Environmental Assessment Center, Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, NY, USA.'}]",,,,© The Author(s) 2021.

25970010","Variants in GCNA, X-linked germ-cell genome integrity gene, identified in men with primary spermatogenic failure.","Male infertility impacts millions of couples yet, the etiology of primary infertility remains largely unknown. A critical element of successful spermatogenesis is maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we present a genomic study of spermatogenic failure (SPGF). Our initial analysis (n = 176) did not reveal known gene-candidates but identified a potentially significant single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in X-linked germ-cell nuclear antigen (GCNA). Together with a larger follow-up study (n = 2049), 7 likely clinically relevant GCNA variants were identified. GCNA is critical for genome integrity in male meiosis and knockout models exhibit impaired spermatogenesis and infertility. Single-cell RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry confirm human GCNA expression from spermatogonia to elongated spermatids. Five identified SNVs were located in key functional regions, including N-terminal SUMO-interacting motif and C-terminal Spartan-like protease domain. Notably, variant p.Ala115ProfsTer7 results in an early frameshift, while Spartan-like domain missense variants p.Ser659Trp and p.Arg664Cys change conserved residues, likely affecting 3D structure. For variants within GCNA's intrinsically disordered region, we performed computational modeling for consensus motifs. Two SNVs were predicted to impact the structure of these consensus motifs. All identified variants have an extremely low minor allele frequency in the general population and 6 of 7 were not detected in > 5000 biological fathers. Considering evidence from animal models, germ-cell-specific expression, 3D modeling, and computational predictions for SNVs, we propose that identified GCNA variants disrupt structure and function of the respective protein domains, ultimately arresting germ-cell division. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating GCNA, a key genome integrity factor, in human male infertility.",[],Human genetics,2021-05-09,"[{'lastname': 'Hardy', 'firstname': 'Jimmaline J',

166,33951564,"Androgen receptor polymorphism, mental rotation, and spatial visualization in men.","Circulating levels of testosterone (T) have been hypothesized to influence spatial cognition in adult men, but empirical support for this idea is mixed. Many of testosterone's effects are mediated by the classic nuclear androgen receptor (AR), which contains a polymorphic glutamine repeat (CAG repeat sequence) that varies significantly across individual men and confers differences in receptor function and therefore individual responsivity to T. We genotyped the AR CAG repeat length in 146 healthy adult men who also performed cognitive tests of mental rotation and spatial visualization. Circulating T concentrations were measured in saliva. CAG repeat length was found to be a significant predictor of spatial scores on tests of visualization but not mental rotation. A weaker AR was associated with lower visualization scores. In contrast, T itself, but not CAG repeat length predicted scores on two mental rotation tests. These results support the view that T action in the brain modestly influences spatial cognition in healthy men, but suggest that T's effects on mental rotation might not be AR-dependent and instead occur through an alternative mechanism.","['AR', 'Androgen receptor', 'CAG repeat', 'Mental rotation', 'Spatial visualization', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-05-06,"[{'lastname': 'Sankar', 'firstname': 'Janani S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5C2 Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hampson', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5C2 Canada.

167,33893042,Risk of Cognitive Effects in Comorbid Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen Receptor Inhibitors.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is primarily a disease of older men. As the risk of neurocognitive decline increases as people age, cognitive dysfunction is a potential complication in men with PC, imposing detrimental effects on functional independence and quality of life. Importantly, risk of cognitive decline may increase with exposure to androgen deprivation therapy and other hormonal therapies. Particular consideration should be given to patients with castration-resistant PC (CRPC), many of whom require continuous, long-term androgen deprivation therapy combined with a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor. Non-comparative evidence from interventional trials of androgen receptor inhibitors in men with non-metastatic CRPC suggests differential effects on cognitive function and central nervous system-related adverse events within this drug class. Drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications for chronic, non-malignant comorbidities differ among ARIs and thus may contribute further to cognitive impairment. Hence, establishing baseline cognitive function is a prerequisite to identifying subsequent clinical decline associated with androgen receptor-targeted therapies. Although brief, sensitive screening tools for cancer-related cognitive dysfunction are lacking, mental status can be ascertained from the initial medical history and neurocognitive examination, progressing to more in-depth evaluation when impairment is suspected. On-treatment neurocognitive monitoring should be integrated into regular clinical follow-up to preserve cognitive function and quality of life throughout disease management. This review summarizes the multiple factors that may contribute to cognitive decline in men with CRPC, awareness of which will assist clinicians to optimize individual treatment. Practical, clinic-based strategies for managing the risks for and symptoms of cognitive dysfunction are also discussed.","['Central nervous system effects', 'Drug–drug interactions', 'Hormonal therapies', 'Management strategies', 'Neurocognition']",Clinical genitourinary cancer,2021-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Morgans', 'firstname': 'Alicia K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Hematology and Oncology), Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL.

168,33836382,Not giving up: Testosterone promotes persistence against a stronger opponent.,"Recent research suggests that when we lack a sense of control, we are prone to motivational failures and early quitting in competitions. Testosterone, on the other hand, is thought to boost competitiveness. Here we investigate the interaction between these factors, testing the testosterone's potential to enhance persistence in a competition against a stronger opponent, depending on experimentally manipulated perceived control. Healthy participants were administered a single dose of testosterone or placebo. They first underwent a task designed to either induce low or high perceived control and then entered a costly competition against a progressively stronger opponent that they could quit at any time. In the placebo group, men with low perceived control quitted twice as early as those with high perceived control. Testosterone countered this effect, making individuals with low control persist in the competition for as long as those with high perceived control, and did so also despite raising participants' explicit awareness of the opponents' advantage. This psychoendocrinological effect was not modulated by basal cortisol levels, CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene, or trait dominance. Our results provide the first causal evidence that testosterone promotes competitive persistence in humans and demonstrate that this effect depends on the psychological state elicited prior to the competition, broadening our understanding of the complex relationships between testosterone and social behaviors.","['Competence', 'Illusory control', 'Motivation', 'Persistence', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-04-10,"[{'lastname': 'Kutlikova', 'firstname': 'Hana H', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychopharmacology and Biopsychology Unit, Department of Cognition, Emotion, and Methods in Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna, Liebiggasse 5, 1010 Vienna, Austria; Department of Behavioural Neuroscience, Institute of Normal and Pathological Physiology, Centre of Experimental Medicine, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Sienkiewiczova 1, 813 71 Bratislava, Slovakia.

170,33799172,"The role of psychopathic traits, social anxiety and cortisol in social approach avoidance tendencies.","Social anxiety and psychopathy have conceptually been linked to nearly opposite emotional, behavioral and endocrinological endophenotypes, representing social fearfulness and fearlessness, respectively. Although such a dimensional view has theoretical and practical implications, no study has directly compared social anxiety and psychopathy in terms of emotional experiences, relevant hormones (i.e. cortisol, testosterone) and behavioral tendencies (i.e. social approach-avoidance). Therefore, the present study examined 1) whether self-reported social anxiety and psychopathic traits are indeed anticorrelated, and 2) whether social anxiety, psychopathic traits, cortisol, testosterone and their interplay are differentially linked to social approach-avoidance tendencies. In a well-powered study, a sample of 196 healthy female participants, we assessed self-reported emotional and behavioral tendencies of social fear (i.e. social anxiety and social avoidance) and psychopathic traits (i.e. Factor I [interpersonal-affective deficit] and Factor II [impulsive behavior]). Furthermore, hormone levels were assessed, and approach-avoidance tendencies towards emotional (angry, happy) facial expressions were measured by means of a joystick reaction time task. Results confirmed that self-reported emotional tendencies of social anxiety and psychopathy Factor I (interpersonal-affective deficit) correlated negatively, but self-reported behavioral tendencies (social avoidance and psychopathy Factor II [impulsive behavior]) correlated positively. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modelling demonstrated that participants with higher social anxiety and higher cortisol levels showed an avoidance tendency towards happy faces, while participants with higher psychopathic traits showed an approach tendency towards angry faces. In sum, the notion that social anxiety and psychopathic traits are opposing ends of one dimension was supported only in terms of self-reported emotional experiences, but a comparable relationship with regard to behavioral and endocrinological aspects is debatable. The current findings stress the necessity to study emotional, endocrinological and behavioral factors in unison in order to better understand the shared and distinctive mechanisms of social anxiety and psychopathic traits.","['Approach-avoidance behavior', 'Cortisol', 'Psychopathic traits', 'Social anxiety', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-04-03,"[{'lastname': 'Dapprich', 'firstname': 'Anna L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

171,33793258,Psychopathic traits influence threat avoidance in a community sample independent of testosterone.,"Psychopathy is a personality construct that encompasses a constellation of traits reflecting emotional dysfunction and antisocial behavior. Individuals with elevated levels of psychopathic traits have shown abnormal affective processing. Studies with psychopathic offenders suggested that this is a result of altered automatic social approach-avoidance tendencies. The goal of the current study was to increase the insight into the underlying mechanism of affective processes in community-dwelling individuals with a high level of psychopathic traits by studying approach and avoidance behavior in an experimental setting. Furthermore, given its link with aggression and threat approach, testosterone was measured to investigate a possible mediatory role. Eighty-seven healthy individuals performed a computerized affective approach-avoidance task in which they pushed or pulled emotional faces using a joystick. The results showed that high levels of psychopathic traits corresponded with diminished threat avoidance to angry faces, as was found previously in psychopathic offenders. Although endogenous testosterone was positively associated with the level of psychopathic traits, it did not mediate the effect of psychopathic traits on threat avoidance. We propose that an increased understanding of the interplay between different neuroendocrine mechanisms could lead to a better insight into the underlying mechanism of abnormal threat avoidance in individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits.

172,33787479,Role of testosterone: cortisol ratio in age- and sex-specific cortico-hippocampal development and cognitive performance.,"Testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) are steroid hormones that have been argued to play opposing roles in shaping physical and behavioral development in humans. While there is evidence linking T and C to different memory processes during adulthood, it remains unclear how the relative levels of T and C (TC ratio) may influence brain and behavioral development, whether they are influenced by sex of the child, and whether or not they occur as a result of stable changes in brain structure (organizational changes), as opposed to transient changes in brain function (activational changes). As such, we tested for associations among TC ratio, cortico-hippocampal structure, and standardized tests of executive, verbal, and visuo-spatial function in a longitudinal sample of typically developing 4-22-year-old children and adolescents. We found greater TC ratios to be associated with greater coordinated growth (i.e. covariance) between the hippocampus and cortical thickness in several areas primarily devoted to visual function. In addition, there was an age-related association between TC ratio and parieto-hippocampal covariance, as well as a sex-specific association between TC ratio and prefrontal-hippocampal covariance. Differences in brain structure related to TC ratio were in turn associated with lower verbal/executive function, as well as greater attention in tests of visuo-spatial abilities. These results support the notion that TC ratio may shift the balance between top-down (cortex to hippocampus) and bottom-up (hippocampus to cortex) processes, impairing more complex, cortical-based tasks and optimizing visuospatial tasks relying primarily on the hippocampus.","['Testosterone', 'cognitive development', 'cortical thickness', 'cortisol', 'hippocampus']",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2021-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Caccese', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Sherri Lee', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Mrinalini', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Ally', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Brossard-Racine', 'firstname': 'Marie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nSchool of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Tuong-Vi', 'initials': 'TV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nDepartment of Obstetrics-Gynecology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}]",,,,,10.1017/S204017442100012X,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df80c7c0>,,,,,,

25749595",Effects of web-based cognitive behavioral stress management and health promotion interventions on neuroendocrine and inflammatory markers in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized controlled trial.,"Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) improves quality of life and mitigates stress biology in patients with early-stage cancer, including men with localized prostate cancer. However, treatments for advanced prostate cancer like androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can lead to significant symptom burden that may be further exacerbated by stress-induced inflammation and cortisol dysregulation. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of CBSM (versus an active health promotion control) on circulating inflammatory markers and cortisol in men with advanced prostate cancer.
Men with stage III or IV prostate cancer (N = 192) who had undergone ADT within the last year were randomized to CBSM or health promotion. Both interventions were 10 weeks, group-based, and delivered online. Venous blood was drawn at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to measure circulating levels of CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α. Saliva samples were collected at awakening, 30 min after awakening, evening, and night for two consecutive days at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months to measure diurnal cortisol slopes.
Mixed modeling analyses demonstrated that changes in inflammatory markers and cortisol did not differ by intervention. Men in both CBSM and health promotion showed decreases in IL-10, IL-8, and TNF-α from baseline to 6 months (β = -3.85--5.04, p's = 0.004-<0.001). However, these markers generally demonstrated a rebound increase from 6 to 12 months (β = 1.91-4.06, p's = 0.06-<0.001). Men in health promotion also demonstrated a flatter diurnal cortisol slope versus men in CBSM at 6 months (β = -2.27, p = .023), but not at 12 months. There were no intervention effects on CRP, IL-6, or overall cortisol output.
Contrary to hypotheses, CBSM did not lead to changes in the circulating inflammatory markers and cortisol relative to health promotion. CBSM may be associated with healthy diurnal cortisol rhythm because of its focus on cognitive behavioral approaches to stress management. More research is needed to understand the impact of CBSM and health promotion on biomarkers among men with advanced prostate cancer.","['Advanced cancer', 'Cognitive behavioral stress management', 'Cortisol', 'Inflammation', 'Metastatic', 'Prostate cancer']","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021-03-20,"[{'lastname': 'Penedo', 'firstname': 'Frank J', 'initials': 'FJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Miami, United States; Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, United States.

175,33722565,The relationship between testosterone and social cognition in younger and older adults.,"Testosterone (T) has been linked to poorer social cognition in younger adults. Because social cognition and T both decline with normal aging, a different type of relationship may exist between T and social cognition in late adulthood. To test this possibility, younger and older adults provided a salivary T sample and completed two social cognition tasks. The results showed that age-group was a significant moderator in the relationship between T and theory of mind (ToM) performance for males, such that T was a negative predictor of ToM in younger males and a positive predictor of ToM in older age. No relationships were identified for females. These findings show for the first time that T is differentially related to ToM in the early and later stages of the male adult lifespan, and are discussed in relation to prior work that suggests T may have neuroprotective effects in older age.","['Age differences', 'Emotion perception', 'Social cognition', 'Testosterone', 'Theory of mind']",Biological psychology,2021-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Grainger', 'firstname': 'Sarah A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of Queensland, Australia.

Focusing on its high sociality, we cloned and characterized some sociality-related genes of degus, in order to establish degus as a highly socialized animal model in molecular biology. We cloned degus Neurexin and Neuroligin as sociality-related genes, which are genetically related to autism spectrum disorder in human. According to our results, amino acid sequences of Neurexin and Neuroligin expressed in degus brain, are highly conserved to that of human sequences. Most notably, degus Neuroligin4 is highly similar to human Neuroligin4X, which is one of the most important autism-related genes, whereas mouse Neuroligin4 is known to be poorly similar to human Neuroligin4X. Furthermore, our work also indicated that testosterone directly binds to degus Neurexin and intercepts intercellular Neurexin-Neuroligin binding. Moreover, it is of high interest that testosterone is another key molecule of the higher incidence of autism in male. These results indicated that degus has the potential for animal model of sociality, and furthermore may promote understanding toward the pathogenic mechanism of autism.","['Autism spectrum disorder', 'Neurexin', 'Neuroligin', 'Octodon degus', 'Testosterone']",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2021-03-16,"[{'lastname': 'Yagishita-Kyo', 'firstname': 'Nan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Saitama Medical University, 38 Moro-hongo, Moroyama-machi, Iruma-gun, Saitama, 350-0495, Japan.

However, observational studies and clinical trials have reported inconsistent results on the effects of testosterone on individual cognitive domains. Null findings may be attributed to factors that studies have yet to consider. In particular, individual variations in polyglutamine (CAG) length in the androgen receptor (AR) gene could alter androgenic activity in brain regions associated with cognitive processes including memory and executive functions. However, the role of AR CAG repeat length as a moderator of the relationship between testosterone levels and cognition has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to examine the relationship between baseline calculated free testosterone (cFT) levels, change in cFT levels over 18 months and CAG repeat length on cognitive performance in memory, executive function, language, attention and processing speed domains. These relationships were examined in 304 cognitively normal older male participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing. In the attention and processing speed domain, a short CAG repeat length appears to exacerbate the effects of low baseline cFT levels that are also lower than expected at follow-up. These results highlight that individual variations in AR CAG repeat length should be considered in future studies and clinical trials that examine the complex relationship between testosterone and cognition.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Androgen receptor', 'Attention', 'Cognition', 'Executive function', 'Language', 'Memory', 'Processing speed', 'Testosterone']",Hormones and behavior,2021-03-15,"[{'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Sherilyn', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Australian Alzheimer's Research Foundation, Ralph and Patricia Sarich Neuroscience Research Institute, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia;

6225566",Correspondence Between Perceived Pubertal Development and Hormone Levels in 9-10 Year-Olds From the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study.,"To examine individual variability between perceived physical features and hormones of pubertal maturation in 9-10-year-old children as a function of sociodemographic characteristics.
Cross-sectional metrics of puberty were utilized from the baseline assessment of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study-a multi-site sample of 9-10 year-olds (n = 11,875)-and included perceived physical features 
PDS summary scores indicated more males (70%) than females (31%) were prepubertal. Perceived physical features and hormone levels were significantly associated with child's weight status and income, such that more mature scores were observed among children that were overweight/obese or from households with low-income. Results from the GFA identified two latent factors that described individual differences in pubertal maturation among both females and males, with factor 1 driven by higher hormone levels, and factor 2 driven by perceived physical maturation. The correspondence between latent factor 1 scores (hormones) and latent factor 2 scores (perceived physical maturation) revealed synchronous and asynchronous relationships between hormones and concomitant physical features in this large young adolescent sample.
Sociodemographic measures were associated with both objective hormone and self-report physical measures of pubertal maturation in a large, diverse sample of 9-10 year-olds. The latent variables of pubertal maturation described a complex interplay between perceived physical changes and hormone levels that hallmark sexual maturation, which future studies can examine in relation to trajectories of brain maturation, risk/resilience to substance use, and other mental health outcomes.","['adolescent brain cognitive development', 'dehydroepiandrosterone', 'estradiol',

179,33677017,Structurally different anabolic androgenic steroids reduce neurite outgrowth and neuronal viability in primary rat cortical cell cultures.,"The illicit use of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) among adolescents and young adults is a major concern due to the unknown and unpredictable impact of AAS on the developing brain and the consequences of this on mental health, cognitive function and behaviour. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of supra-physiological doses of four structurally different AAS (testosterone, nandrolone, stanozolol and trenbolone) on neurite development and cell viability using an in vitro model of immature primary rat cortical cell cultures. A high-throughput screening image-based approach, measuring the neurite length and number of neurons, was used for the analysis of neurite outgrowth. In addition, cell viability and expression of the Tubb3 gene (encoding the protein beta-III tubulin) were investigated. Testosterone, nandrolone, and trenbolone elicited adverse effects on neurite outgrowth as deduced from an observed reduced neurite length per neuron. Trenbolone was the only AAS that reduced the cell viability as indicated by a decreased number of neurons and declined mitochondrial function. Moreover, trenbolone downregulated the Tubb3 mRNA expression. The adverse impact on neurite development was neither inhibited nor supressed by the selective androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, flutamide, suggesting that the observed effects result from another mechanism or mechanisms of action that are operating apart from AR activation. The results demonstrate a possible AAS-induced detrimental effect on neuronal development and regenerative functions. An impact on these events, that are essential mechanisms for maintaining normal brain function, could possibly contribute to behavioural alterations seen in AAS users.","['Anabolic androgenic steroids', 'Neurite outgrowth', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Primary cortical cell culture', 'Rat']",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2021-03-08,"[{'lastname': 'Zelleroth', 'firstname': 'Sofia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Beijer Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Division of Biological Research on Drug Dependence, SE-751 24, Uppsala University, Sweden.

180,33619782,"Effects of androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive functions in patients with metastatic prostate cancer: A multicentric, prospective study of the Society of Urological Surgery Andrology group.","The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of testosterone deficiency on cognitive functions in metastatic prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).
In this multicentric prospective study, 65 metastatic prostate cancer patients were evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the California Verbal Learning Test Second Edition, the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised, and the Trail Making Test. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. Cognitive functions and depressive symptoms were recorded before the androgen deprivation therapy and at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups.
At the basal cognitive assessment, the mean Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the California Verbal Learning Test Second Edition, the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised scores were 25.84 ± 17.54, 32.68 ± 10.60, and 17.63 ± 11.23, respectively, and the mean time for the Trail Making Test was 221.56 ± 92.44 seconds, and were similar at the 3-month, and 6-month controls (P > .05). The mean pretreatment, third and sixth month testosterone levels were 381.40 ± 157.53 ng/dL, 21.61 ± 9.09 ng/dL and 12.25 ± 6.45 ng/dL (P < .05), and the total PSA levels were 46.46 ± 37.83 ng/mL, 1.41 ± 3.31 ng/mL and 0.08 ± 0.14 ng/mL (P < .05), respectively.

182,33559323,Fish as a model in social neuroscience: conservation and diversity in the social brain network.,"Mechanisms for fish social behaviours involve a social brain network (SBN) which is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates. However, considerable diversity is observed in the actual behaviour patterns amongst nearly 30000 fish species. The huge variation found in socio-sexual behaviours and strategies is likely generated by a morphologically and genetically well-conserved small forebrain system. Hence, teleost fish provide a useful model to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying social brain functions. Herein we review the foundations underlying fish social behaviours including sensory, hormonal, molecular and neuroanatomical features. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons clearly play important roles, but the participation of vasotocin and isotocin is also highlighted. Genetic investigations of developing fish brain have revealed the molecular complexity of neural development of the SBN. In addition to straightforward social behaviours such as sex and aggression, new experiments have revealed higher order and unique phenomena such as social eavesdropping and social buffering in fish. Finally, observations interpreted as 'collective cognition' in fish can likely be explained by careful observation of sensory determinants and analyses using the dynamics of quantitative scaling. Understanding of the functions of the SBN in fish provide clues for understanding the origin and evolution of higher social functions in vertebrates.","['aggression', 'amygdala', 'androgen', 'criticality', 'habenula', 'hypothalamus', 'oestrogen', 'reproduction', 'sex change', 'transcriptome']",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,2021-02-10,"[{'lastname': 'Ogawa', 'firstname': 'Satoshi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Brain Research Institute, Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Selangor, 47500, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pfaff', 'firstname': 'Donald W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neurobiology and Behavior, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, 10065, U.S.A.'}, {'lastname': 'Parhar', 'firstname': 'Ishwar S', 'initials': 'IS', 'affiliation': 'Brain Research Institute, Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Selangor, 47500, Malaysia.'}]",,,,© 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.,10.1111/brv.12689,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df506220>,,,,,,

18608856",Testosterone and the brain: from cognition to autism.,"Sex and gender matter in all aspects of life. Humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in anatomy, physiology, but also pathology. Many of the differences are due to sex chromosomes and, thus, genetics, other due to endocrine factors such as sex hormones, some are of social origin. Over the past decades, huge number of scientific studies have revealed striking sex differences of the human brain with remarkable behavioral and cognitive consequences. Prenatal and postnatal testosterone influence brain structures and functions, respectively. Cognitive sex differences include especially certain spatial and language tasks, but they also affect many other aspects of the neurotypical brain. Sex differences of the brain are also relevant for the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, which are much more prevalent in the male population. Structural dimorphism in the human brain was well-described, but recent controversies now question its importance. On the other hand, solid evidence exists regarding gender differences in several brain functions. This review tries to summarize the current understanding of the complexity of the effects of testosterone on brain with special focus on their role in the known sex differences in healthy individuals and people in the autism spectrum.",[],Physiological research,2021-01-20,"[{'lastname': 'Ostatníková', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. daniela.ostatnikova@fmed.uniba.sk.'}, {'lastname': 'Lakatošová', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Babková', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hodosy', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Celec', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.33549/physiolres.934592

30234186","Association of acne, hirsutism, androgen, anxiety, and depression on cognitive performance in polycystic ovary syndrome: A cross-sectional study.","While polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often associated with psychological distress, its most frequent clinical characteristics include acne, hirsutism and increased level of androgen hormones.
To evaluate the level of depression and anxiety, hirsutism, acne, and level of androgen hormones in PCOS and control group and its association with cognitive function.
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 53 women with PCOS and 50 healthy women as a control group. Data were collected using a questionnaire including the samples' demographic information, clinical features, clinical findings of hyperandrogenism, and the Beck Depression and Anxiety questionnaire. In addition, the acne and hirsutism levels of the subjects were evaluated using the global acne grading system and the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system, respectively. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening test for cognitive impairment that covers major cognitive domains.
A significant difference was found between the two groups in the mean levels of acne, hirsutism, total testosterone, free androgen index, depression, and anxiety. However, some mean values of the MoCA were lower in the women of case group compared to the control group. Additionally, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in the domains of visual-spatial ability (p = 0.009), executive function (p = 0.05), attention (p = 0.03), and total MoCA scores (p = 0.002).
The PCOS women demonstrated significantly lower performance on the tests of executive function, attention, and visual-spatial function than the healthy control women.","[' Androgen', ' Cognitive function', ' Depression and anxiety.', 'PCOS']",International journal of reproductive biomedicine,2021-01-12,"[{'lastname': 'Mehrabadi', 'firstname': 'Saeideh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Reproductive Health and Midwifery, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Sadatmahalleh', 'firstname': 'Shahideh Jahanian', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Reproductive Health and Midwifery, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Kazemnejad', 'firstname': 'Anoshirvan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Moini', 'firstname': 'Ashraf', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Breast Disease Research Center (BDRC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Arash Women's Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Female Infertility, Reproductive Biomedicine Research Center, Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.""}]",,"The PCOS women demonstrated significantly lower performance on the tests of executive function, attention, and visual-spatial function than the healthy control women.","A significant difference was found between the two groups in the mean levels of acne, hirsutism, total testosterone, free androgen index, depression, and anxiety.

17052857",Progesterone modulates theta oscillations in the frontal-parietal network.,"The neuroactive metabolites of the steroid hormones progesterone (P4) and testosterone (T) are GABAergic modulators that influence cognition, yet, the specific effect of P4 and T on brain network activity remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated if a fundamental oscillatory network activity pattern, often related to cognitive control, frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations, are modulated by steroids hormones, P4 and T. We measured the concentration of P4 and T using salivary enzyme immunoassay and FMT oscillations using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during eyes-open resting-state in 55 healthy women and men. Electrical brain activity was analyzed using Fourier analysis, aperiodic signal fitting, and beamformer source localization. Steroid hormone concentrations and biological sex were used as predictors for scalp and source-estimated amplitude of theta oscillations. Elevated concentrations of P4 predicted increased amplitude of FMT oscillations across both sexes, and no relationship was found with T. The positive correlation with P4 was specific to the frontal midline electrodes and survived correction for the background aperiodic signal of the brain. Using source localization, FMT oscillations were localized to the frontal-parietal network (FPN). Additionally, theta amplitude within the FPN, but not the default mode network, positively correlated with P4 concentration. Our results suggest that P4 concentration modulates brain activity via upregulation of theta oscillations in the FPN.","['EEG', 'aperiodic signal correction', 'frontal midline theta', 'frontal‐parietal network', 'progesterone', 'source localization', 'steroid hormones', 'theta oscillations']",Psychophysiology,2021-01-06,"[{'lastname': 'Riddle', 'firstname': 'Justin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCarolina Center for Neurostimulation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCenter for Women's Mood Disorders, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Ahn', 'firstname': 'Sangtae', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCarolina Center for Neurostimulation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nSchool of Electronic Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'McPherson', 'firstname': 'Trevor', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCarolina Center for Neurostimulation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Girdler', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCenter for Women's Mood Disorders, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Frohlich', 'firstname': 'Flavio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCarolina Center for Neurostimulation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nDepartment of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nNeuroscience Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}]",,,,© 2020 Society for Psychophysiological Research.,"10.1111/psyp.13632

19016938",Systemic inflammation and symptomatology in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy: Preliminary findings.,"Increases in fatigue, depressive symptomatology, and cognitive impairment are common after the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. To date, no studies have examined the potential role of inflammation in the development of these symptoms in ADT recipients. The goal of the current study was to examine circulating markers of inflammation as potential mediators of change in fatigue, depressive symptomatology, and cognitive impairment related to the receipt of ADT.
Patients treated with ADT for prostate cancer (ADT+; n = 47) were assessed around the time of the initiation of ADT and 6 and 12 months later. An age- and education-matched group of men without a history of cancer (CA-; n = 82) was assessed at comparable time points. Fatigue, depressive symptomatology, and cognitive impairment were assessed with the Fatigue Symptom Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and a battery of neuropsychological tests, respectively. Circulating markers of inflammation included interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II (sTNF-RII), and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Fatigue, depressive symptomatology, and serum IL-6 increased significantly over time in the ADT+ group versus the CA- group; rates of cognitive impairment also changed significantly between the groups. No significant changes in IL-1RA, sTNF-RII, or CRP over time were detected. Treatment-related increases in IL-6 were associated with worsening fatigue but not depressive symptomatology or cognitive impairment.
Results of this preliminary study suggest that increases in circulating IL-6, perhaps due to testosterone inhibition, may play a role in fatigue secondary to receipt of ADT. Additional research is needed to determine whether interventions to reduce circulating inflammation improve fatigue in this population.","['antineoplastic agents', 'cognition', 'depression', 'fatigue', 'inflammation', 'prostatic neoplasms']",Cancer,2020-12-31,"[{'lastname': 'Hoogland', 'firstname': 'Aasha I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Jim', 'firstname': 'Heather S L', 'initials': 'HSL', 'affiliation': 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Brian D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Small', 'firstname': 'Brent J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilvary', 'firstname': 'Danielle', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Breen', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': 'University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Bower', 'firstname': 'Julienne E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Fishman', 'firstname': 'Mayer', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Zachariah', 'firstname': 'Babu', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': ""James A.

31296441",An Updated Review: Androgens and Cognitive Impairment in Older Men.,"Androgens are some of the most important sex hormones in men, and they maintain important physiological activities in the human body. Cognitive impairment is one of the most common manifestations of aging in the elderly population and an important factor affecting the quality of life of elderly individuals. The levels of sex hormones in elderly people decrease with age, and low levels of androgens in older male individuals have been closely linked to the development of cognitive impairment. Basic studies have shown that androgens have neuroprotective effects and that androgen deficiency impairs cognitive function by increasing oxidative stress and decreasing synaptic plasticity, among other effects. Additionally, clinical studies have also shown that androgen deficiency is closely related to cognitive impairment. This article reviews the relationship between low androgen levels and cognitive impairment, their potential mechanisms, and the effects of testosterone supplementation in improving cognition.","['aging', 'androgen', 'cognitive impairment', 'molecular mechanism', 'older men']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020-12-08,"[{'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Zhonglin', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Hongjun', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2020 Cai and Li.,"10.3389/fendo.2020.586909

23462686","Linking human male vocal parameters to perceptions, body morphology, strength and hormonal profiles in contexts of sexual selection.","Sexual selection appears to have shaped the acoustic signals of diverse species, including humans. Deep, resonant vocalizations in particular may function in attracting mates and/or intimidating same-sex competitors. Evidence for these adaptive functions in human males derives predominantly from perception studies in which vocal acoustic parameters were manipulated using specialist software. This approach affords tight experimental control but provides little ecological validity, especially when the target acoustic parameters vary naturally with other parameters. Furthermore, such experimental studies provide no information about what acoustic variables indicate about the speaker-that is, why attention to vocal cues may be favored in intrasexual and intersexual contexts. Using voice recordings with high ecological validity from 160 male speakers and biomarkers of condition, including baseline cortisol and testosterone levels, body morphology and strength, we tested a series of pre-registered hypotheses relating to both perceptions and underlying condition of the speaker. We found negative curvilinear and negative linear relationships between male fundamental frequency (f",[],Scientific reports,2020-12-06,"[{'lastname': 'Schild', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Copenhagen, Øster Farimagsgade 2A, 1353, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Aung', 'firstname': 'Toe', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology and Center for Brain, Behavior and Cognition, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kordsmeyer', 'firstname': 'Tobias L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Leibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition, University of Goettingen, Gosslerstrasse 14, 37073, Göttingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Cardenas', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Puts', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology and Center for Brain, Behavior and Cognition, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. dap27@psu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Penke', 'firstname': 'Lars', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Leibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition, University of Goettingen, Gosslerstrasse 14, 37073, Göttingen, Germany. lpenke@uni-goettingen.de.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-020-77940-z

9101730",Astrocyte-Derived Estrogen Regulates Reactive Astrogliosis and is Neuroprotective following Ischemic Brain Injury.,"Expression of the 17β-estradiol (E2) synthesis enzyme aromatase is highly upregulated in astrocytes following brain injury. However, the precise role of astrocyte-derived E2 in the injured brain remains unclear. In the current study, we generated a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter-driven aromatase knock-out (GFAP-ARO-KO) mouse model to deplete astrocyte-derived E2 in the brain and determine its roles after global cerebral ischemia (GCI) in male and female mice. GFAP-ARO-KO mice were viable and fertile, with normal gross brain structure, normal morphology, intensity and distribution of astrocytes, normal aromatase expression in neurons, and normal cognitive function basally. In contrast, after GCI, GFAP-ARO-KO mice: (1) lacked the normal elevation of astrocyte aromatase and hippocampal E2 levels; (2) had significantly attenuated reactive astrogliosis; and (3) displayed enhanced neuronal damage, microglia activation, and cognitive deficits. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that the ischemic GFAP-ARO-KO mouse hippocampus failed to upregulate the ""A2"" panel of reactive astrocyte genes. In addition, the JAK-STAT3 pathway, which is critical for the induction of reactive astrogliosis, was significantly downregulated in the GFAP-ARO-KO hippocampus following GCI. Finally, exogenous E2 administration fully rescued the compromised JAK-STAT3 pathway and reactive astrogliosis, and reversed the enhanced neuronal damage and microglial activation in the GFAP-ARO-KO mice after GCI, suggesting that the defects in the KO mice are because of a loss of E2 rather than an increase in precursor androgens. In conclusion, the current study provides novel genetic evidence for a beneficial role of astrocyte-derived E2 in reactive astrogliosis, microglial activation, and neuroprotection following an ischemic injury to the brain.","['17β-estradiol', 'aromatase', 'astrocyte activation', 'estrogen', 'global cerebral ischemia', 'hippocampus']",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2020-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912.'}, {'lastname': 'Sareddy', 'firstname': 'Gangadhara R', 'initials': 'GR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Health, San Antonio, Texas 78229.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yujiao', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912.'}, {'lastname': 'Pratap', 'firstname': 'Uday P', 'initials': 'UP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Health, San Antonio, Texas 78229.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Fulei', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912.'}, {'lastname': 'Greene', 'firstname': 'Karah M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912.'}, {'lastname': 'Meyre', 'firstname': 'Pornjittra L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912.'}, {'lastname': 'Tekmal', 'firstname': 'Rajeshwar R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Health, San Antonio, Texas 78229.'}, {'lastname': 'Vadlamudi', 'firstname': 'Ratna K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Health, San Antonio, Texas 78229 dbrann@augusta.edu vadlamudi@uthscsa.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Brann', 'firstname': 'Darrell W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912 dbrann@augusta.edu vadlamudi@uthscsa.edu.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2020 the authors.,"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0888-20.2020

17482188",Exploring the hormonal and neural correlates of paternal protective behavior to their infants.,"Infant protection is an important but largely neglected aspect of parental care. Available theory and research suggest that endocrine levels and neural responses might be biological correlates of protective behavior. However, no research to date examined associations between these neurobiological and behavioral aspects. This study, preregistered on https://osf.io/2acxd, explored the psychobiology of paternal protection in 77 new fathers by combining neural responses to infant-threatening situations, self-reported protective behavior, behavioral observations in a newly developed experimental set-up (Auditory Startling Task), and measurements of testosterone and vasopressin. fMRI analyses validated the role of several brain networks in the processing of infant-threatening situations and indicated replicable findings with the infant-threat paradigm. We found little overlap between observed and reported protective behavior. Robust associations between endocrine levels, neural responses, and paternal protective behavior were absent.","['brain imaging', 'fathers', 'hormones', 'parental care', 'protection']",Developmental psychobiology,2020-11-05,"[{'lastname': 'Lotz', 'firstname': 'Anna M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nLeiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Verhees', 'firstname': 'Martine W F T', 'initials': 'MWFT', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Horstman', 'firstname': 'Lisa I', 'initials': 'LI', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nLeiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Riem', 'firstname': 'Madelon M E', 'initials': 'MME', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nBehavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van IJzendoorn', 'firstname': 'Marinus H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Education and Child Studies, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakermans-Kranenburg', 'firstname': 'Marian J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nLeiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Buisman', 'firstname': 'Renate S M', 'initials': 'RSM', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}]",,,,© 2020 The Authors.

194,33064410,"Is There a Link between Stress and Cognition, and Capacity to Execute Motor Skill?","This study aimed to examine the link between stress (measured via salivary cortisol and testosterone), cognition (measured via pupillometry, with greater pupil constriction and reduced pupil constriction latency associated with increased attention and improved information processing), and motor skill capacity (measured via somatosensory processing).
Twenty-five professional rugby players participated in this study. Saliva samples were collected upon waking, before pupillometry and somatosensory processing testing, and after testing. Testing times varied for participants; however, it was always in the morning, and the order of testing was randomized.
Very small differences in hormone concentrations were seen across the morning (effect size = 0.01). Moderate to large differences in left eye pupil constriction for direct (left eye) versus consensual (right eye) stimulus were also seen (P < 0.01; effect size = 0.51 to 1.04). No differences for pupil constriction latency were seen for direct versus consensual stimulus. Some positive weak to moderate relationships were seen for testosterone and pupil constriction latency (r = 0.37 to 0.39, P < 0.05). Moderate to strong inverse relationships were seen for hormones with left eye pupil constriction difference between direct and consensual stimulus, and for pre- to posttest testosterone-to-cortisol ratio decline with left eye pupil constriction for direct and consensual stimulus (r = 0.41 to 0.52, P < 0.05). Weak to moderate inverse relationships for testosterone-to-cortisol ratio decline and somatosensory processing were seen (r = 0.36 to 0.47, P < 0.05).

195,33008530,"Sex difference in Alzheimer's disease: An updated, balanced and emerging perspective on differing vulnerabilities.","Sex biology influences Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sex differences exist in the epidemiologic, imaging, biomarker, and pathology studies of this uniquely human condition. The mandate to understand sex differences in major diseases like AD is important for many reasons. First, AD is the most common neurodegenerative condition and a devastating disease-experienced as an insidious and progressive erosion of memory, cognition, and other brain functions. Second, since true sex differences in AD exist, their precise understanding could reveal what protects one sex or makes the other vulnerable-and this knowledge could inform development of new therapeutic approaches to benefit both sexes. Third, AD develops in the aging brain in a milieu of decreased circulating gonadal hormones. Thus, how sex-specific depletion affects the brain along with how replacement of androgens in men and estrogens and progestins in women alters vulnerability to AD are relevant questions, with clinical implications in a future of personalized medicine. This review will highlight advances in sex differences in AD in human populations with a focused perspective on epidemiology, biomarkers, and clinical trials. A thorough and concise overview of sex differences reviewed here indicates varying vulnerabilities in men and women. This review examines several lines of recent and strong evidence that collectively indicate the following: (1) men die faster with AD, (2) more women live with AD, (3) both sexes show similar risk of developing AD until advanced ages when women show increased risk, (4) both sexes show largely similar AD biomarker burden with notable exceptions for higher tau levels in subgroups of women with high amyloid, (5) women show brain reserve and resilience to tau pathology, (6) both sexes are vulnerable to the genetic risk of carrying APOE4, with women showing higher risk, and (7) neither sex has shown clear benefit of hormone replacement for AD or dementia risk in randomized clinical trials to date.","['Aging', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Androgen', 'Biomarkers', 'Dementia', 'Estrogen', 'Gender', 'Sex', 'Sex difference', 'Testosterone']",Handbook of clinical neurology,2020-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Dubal', 'firstname': 'Dena B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Endowed Chair in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.

196,32986665,Association of Androgens and Gonadotropins with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Probable Alzheimer's Disease in Chinese Elderly Men.,"Age-related hormone changes play important roles in cognitive decline in older men, and apolipoprotein E ɛ4 (APOEɛ4) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
This study aimed to investigate the interactive role of androgen decline and APOEɛ4 genotype in the pathogenesis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD.
In total, 576 elderly men over 65 years old from communities in Shijiazhuang were enrolled in this study, including 243 with normal cognition (NC), 271 with aMCI, and 62 with probable AD. Cognitive function was evaluated with a battery of neuropsychological tests. The serum levels of androgen and gonadotropin were detected by ELISA and chemiluminescence immunoassay.
The levels of free testosterone (FT) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were lower in the aMCI group (p < 0.05), and even lower in the AD group (p < 0.001), but the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)were higher in AD group (p < 0.01), comparing with that in NC or aMCI group. The interaction of lower FT or DHT levels with APOEɛ4 had a risk role in global cognitive impairment (p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve for predicting aMCI by serum FT levels was 0.745.
These results indicated that the interaction of androgen decline and APOEɛ4 genotype play a role in aMCI and AD. Serum FT levels have a predictive value for aMCI and might be a potential biomarker for prodromal AD.","['APOE', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'androgen', 'gonadotropin', 'testosterone']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-09-29,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Anatomy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, P.

197,32979743,Endogenous testosterone is associated with increased striatal response to audience effects during prosocial choices.,"The role of testosterone on cognitive functions in humans remains controversial. One recent hypothesis suggests that this steroid hormone advances social status. As being observed by others is known to modulate a range of behaviors because of image concerns, we hypothesized that such an audience effect might be an important component of status seeking that is under the control of testosterone. Thus, we investigated to which extent testosterone levels are associated with the effect of being observed during prosocial choices and the neural mechanisms underlying this effect. We enrolled twenty-four male participants, aged 22.47 ± 2.62 years, in an fMRI experiment to examine the relationship between testosterone levels and brain activity engaged in deciding whether to accept or reject monetary transfers to two types of organizations (a positively evaluated organization and a negatively evaluated organization) in presence or absence of an audience. When comparing the public to the private condition, the rate of acceptance increased for the positively evaluated organization, while the rate of rejection increased for the negatively evaluated one. Higher testosterone levels were linked to greater activation in the striatum in the public compared to the private condition, regardless of the organization type. These results indicate a relationship between testosterone levels and striatal activity induced by the audience effect. These findings provide new insights on the role of testosterone in human social behavior.","['Audience effect', 'Charitable giving', 'Social image', 'Striatum', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-09-27,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yansong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Reward, Competition and Social Neuroscience Lab, Department of Psychology, School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Institute for Brain Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.

30763142",Evaluation of Cognitive Function in Trials Testing New-Generation Hormonal Therapy in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"In patients with prostate cancer, earlier use and longer duration of new-generation hormonal therapy (NGHT), added to androgen deprivation therapy, requires careful evaluation of cognitive function. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the evidence about cognitive function in all the randomized trials (RCTs) testing NGHT (abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide). We assessed the availability of both investigator-assessed cognitive impairment and disorders and patient-reported evaluation of cognitive function. Nineteen RCTs (17,617 patients) were included. The investigator-based evaluation of cognitive impairment was available in seven RCTs (36.8%). In total, 19/19 RCTs (100%) included patient-reported outcomes (PROs) collection, but PRO tools adopted allowed evaluation of cognitive function in two RCTs (10.5%). Among them, PRO-based cognitive function results were presented only in one RCT (5.3%): in ENZAMET, mean changes from baseline were worse with enzalutamide than with placebo, but deterioration-free survival favored enzalutamide. Despite cognitive deterioration could be relevant, clinical development of NGHT has not included a systematic evaluation of cognitive function. Assessment by investigators is at risk of underreporting, and commonly used PROs do not allow proper cognitive function analysis. Furthermore, the methodology of analysis can jeopardize the interpretation of results. Although direct comparisons are scanty, there could be differences between different NGHTs.","['abiraterone', 'apalutamide', 'cognitive function', 'darolutamide', 'enzalutamide', 'prostate cancer']",Cancers,2020-09-13,"[{'lastname': 'Marandino', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10043 Torino, Italy.\nMedical Oncology, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Fondazione IRCCS, 20133 Milano, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Vignani', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Medical Oncology, Ordine Mauriziano Hospital, 10128 Torino, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Buttigliero', 'firstname': 'Consuelo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10043 Torino, Italy.\nMedical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, 10043 Orbassano, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gamba', 'firstname': 'Teresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10043 Torino, Italy.\nMedical Oncology, Ordine Mauriziano Hospital, 10128 Torino, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Necchi', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Medical Oncology, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Fondazione IRCCS, 20133 Milano, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Tucci', 'firstname': 'Marcello', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Medical Oncology, Cardinal Massaia Hospital, 14100 Asti, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Di Maio', 'firstname': 'Massimo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10043 Torino, Italy.\nMedical Oncology, Ordine Mauriziano Hospital, 10128 Torino, Italy.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/cancers12092568

In a randomized control trial, 71 preadolescent children (39 girls) at the age of 9-10 years were randomly assigned to a cardiovascular exercise group (CE), a motor exercise group (ME) as well as a control group (CON) in which students were attending assisted homework. The participants attended their program three times per week, for a total of 10 weeks. Steroid hormones in the saliva, working memory performance and state-trait anxiety levels were determined before and after the intervention.
Statistical analysis showed no chronic changes in hormones through the interventions.

200,32902162,Reflections on the T Trials.,"This manuscript is a review and discussion of the published results of the T Trials.
To re-examine the efficacy of testosterone replacement of hypogonadal men >65 years of age in the T Trials.
The T Trials were a complex collection of seven double blind, placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of testosterone as replacement therapy for older men with unequivocal hypogonadism. There were three main trials (sexual function; physical function; vitality) and four sub-trials (cognition; bone; anemia; and cardiovascular). All subjects participated in the main trials while more selective inclusion/exclusion criteria existed for the sub-trials. Subjects were excluded for perceived higher risk of prostate cancer and recent myocardial or cerebral vascular events.
The previously published results are reviewed here as seen in the context of this special issue on late-onset hypogonadism. In the T Trials, positive benefits were seen in the sexual function, bone, and anemia trials with small but significant benefits in the vitality trial. No benefit was seen in the cognition trial, partial benefit in physical function, and a negative benefit outcome seen in the cardiovascular trial. The later trial was underpowered and the results were described as exploratory. Adverse events were relatively uncommon in the 12-month treatment phase and additional 12-month post-treatment phase. The most frequent adverse effect ascribed to testosterone was erythrocytosis.
The T Trials studied the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy on 788 men with low testosterone and symptoms of hypogonadism. The studies demonstrated benefits in four trials (sexual function, vitality, bone, and anemia); partial benefit in the physical function trial; no effect in the cognition trial; and a negative effect in the exploratory cardiovascular trial. The T Trials were not designed to assess long-term risks of testosterone in men.","['anemia', 'bone health', 'late-onset hypogonadism', 'physical function', 'sexual function', 'testosterone']",Andrology,2020-09-10,"[{'lastname': 'Swerdloff', 'firstname': 'Ronald', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, The Lundquist Institute and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, The Lundquist Institute and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA.\nClinical and Translational Science Institute, The Lundquist Institute and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA.'}]",,,"The previously published results are reviewed here as seen in the context of this special issue on late-onset hypogonadism.

201,32898507,Tibolone regulates systemic metabolism and the expression of sex hormone receptors in the central nervous system of ovariectomised rats fed with high-fat and high-fructose diet.,"Estrogen replacement therapy decreases some risk factors of the metabolic syndrome but increases the risk of some types of cancer. Tibolone (TIB) has shown similar neuroprotective effects as estrogens. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of TIB on metabolic parameters and the expression of sex hormone receptors in the CNS in ovariectomised rats fed with a hypercaloric diet. Sprague-Dawley female rats were ovariectomised and fed for 30 days with a standard diet (SD) or high-fat high-fructose diet (HFFD) and treated with TIB (1 mg/kg) or vehicle. At the end of the treatments, HFFD increased body weight, glucose tolerance, triglycerides and cholesterol levels, while TIB treatment decreased these parameters. Subsequently, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and the frontal cortex were dissected. RT-PCR was performed for progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERα, ERβ), insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). HFFD altered the expression of sex hormone receptors in specific brain structures involved in the regulation of homeostasis and cognition, which highlights the importance of a healthy diet. In turn, TIB modulated the expression of these receptors, particularly in the hypothalamus.","['Hormone receptors', 'Hormone replacement therapy', 'Menopause', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Tibolone']",Brain research,2020-09-09,"[{'lastname': 'Coyoy-Salgado', 'firstname': 'Angélica', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Cátedras CONACyT-Unidad de Investigación Médica en Enfermedades Neurológicas, Hospital de Especialidades Dr. Bernardo Sepúlveda, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Segura-Uribe', 'firstname': 'Julia J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Unidad de Investigación Médica en Enfermedades Neurológicas, Hospital de Especialidades Dr. Bernardo Sepúlveda, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social and Departamento de Investigación, Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez, Secretaría de Salud, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Manuel Gallardo', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Unidad de Investigación Médica en Enfermedades Nefrológicas, Hospital de Especialidades Dr. Bernardo Sepúlveda, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Estrada-Cruz', 'firstname': 'Norma A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Unidad de Investigación Médica en Farmacología, Hospital de Especialidades Dr. Bernardo Sepúlveda, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Camacho-Arroyo', 'firstname': 'Ignacio', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Unidad de Investigación en Reproducción Humana, Instituto Nacional de Perinatología-Facultad de Química, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Guerra-Araiza', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Unidad de Investigación Médica en Farmacología, Hospital de Especialidades Dr. Bernardo Sepúlveda, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.

202,32871336,Single dose testosterone administration modulates the temporal dynamics of distractor processing.,"Some evidence suggests that testosterone can increase attentional orientation toward biologically relevant stimuli and increase sustained attention during goal-oriented behaviors. While rare irregular distractors often capture attention involuntarily and distract us away from the task at hand, we hypothesized that testosterone might (1) facilitate attentional orientation to novel distractors that are of potential behavioral relevance and (2) inhibit information processing of distractors that are irrelevant to the task. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of testosterone on distractor processing in a novelty oddball task, during which infrequent target and distractor sounds were interspersed within a series of frequent non-target sounds. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-participant design, we administered a single dose of either testosterone or placebo to 34 healthy male volunteers and compared their electroencephalographic responses to distractors. Increased amplitude of the early (260-310 ms) P3 component-which has been associated with phasic arousal and alertness triggered by novel stimuli-was observed in the testosterone session than in the placebo session. This early-P3 response mediated the effect of testosterone administration on target hit rate during the task. In addition, less α-oscillation suppression-which has been associated with the inhibition of task-irrelevant information processing-was observed in response to distractors later (538-757 ms) in the testosterone session than in the placebo session. These results suggest that testosterone facilitated phasic arousal to novel distractors during the early-latency stage, which might have influenced behavioral performance during the task. Furthermore, testosterone inhibited task-irrelevant information processing during the late-latency stage, which allowed better reorientation of attention back to the primary task. Our findings highlight the role of testosterone in distractor processing, and provide a theoretical basis for treating attention-related behavioral disorders with hormone therapies.","['attention orientation', 'distractibility', 'early-P3', 'event-related potentials', 'testosterone', 'α-oscillation']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-09-02,"[{'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Huihua', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Affective and Social Cognitive Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Department of Psychology, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Weiwei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Affective and Social Cognitive Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.

17804063","Quality of life in Klinefelter patients on testosterone replacement therapy compared to healthy controls: an observational study on the impact of psychological distress, personality traits, and coping strategies.","We aimed to verify if 1 year-testosterone-replacement therapy could produce a psychopathological recovery and a satisfactory quality of life in Klinefelter syndrome (KS) patients compared to matched healthy controls. Further, we analyzed personality traits and coping strategies, an issue not yet examined in androgen-treated KS patients. We also enquired whether any of the sociodemographic and psychological variables might predict a patient's general and sexual life satisfaction.
The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised were administered to both 23 KS patients and matched healthy subjects. Psychopathology was investigated by the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Mini-mental State Examination. The COPE Inventory was used to identify cognitive and behavioral strategies to manage disease-related distress.
In testosterone-treated KS patients, when compared with controls, SCL-90-R subscales analysis evidenced high psychological distress, mainly presented as obsessive thoughts, hanger-hostility, phobias, and psychoticism. Self-directedness and self-transcendence, along with the prevalent use of emotion-focused coping strategies, outlined the personality of our KS patients. Depression and somatization proved to be predictors of general life dissatisfaction. Depression, anger-hostility, and paranoid ideation, instead, emerged as predictors of sexual life dissatisfaction.
Endocrinologists should cooperate with mental health providers to foster a better outcome of the disease in KS patients.","['Coping strategies', 'Genetic disorder', 'Klinefelter syndrome', 'Personality traits', 'Quality of life', 'Testosterone replacement therapy']",Journal of endocrinological investigation,2020-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Fabrazzo', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Accardo', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Unit of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Science, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Abbondandolo', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Goglia', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Esposito', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Sampogna', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Catapano', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Giugliano', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Unit of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Science, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Pasquali', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Unit of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Science, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy. daniela.pasquali@unicampania.it.""}]",,Endocrinologists should cooperate with mental health providers to foster a better outcome of the disease in KS patients.,"In testosterone-treated KS patients, when compared with controls, SCL-90-R subscales analysis evidenced high psychological distress, mainly presented as obsessive thoughts, hanger-hostility, phobias, and psychoticism.

204,32856962,The Risk of New Onset Dementia and/or Alzheimer Disease among Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Androgen deprivation therapy is a standard therapy for some patients with localized and almost all patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Although several clinical cohort studies have identified an impact of androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive function, the previous reviews were not able to perform a well designed quantitative synthesis to summarize the risk of dementia and/or Alzheimer disease. Consequently there is still a lack of systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the impact of this risk including more recent studies.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature assessing the differential incidence of dementia and/or Alzheimer disease as outcomes in patients with prostate cancer who did vs did not receive androgen deprivation therapy. We queried PubMed® and Web of Science™ databases from January 1 to 3, 2020. We used random or fixed effects meta-analytic models in the presence or absence of heterogeneity per the I
A total of 14 studies were selected after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. Nine of them reported all cause dementia (ie all types of dementia including Alzheimer disease), with 8 reporting Alzheimer disease. Five studies assessed these outcomes according to the duration of androgen deprivation therapy. The risk of new onset dementia (all cause) and Alzheimer disease was higher in patients with prostate cancer who received androgen deprivation therapy compared to those who did not (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11-1.33 and HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.24). The risk of dementia (all cause) was higher in patients with prostate cancer who received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 12 months (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07-1.72); however, for those who had less than 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy exposure the difference was not statistically significant 1.06 (95% CI 0.77-1.28). There was no association between the androgen deprivation therapy duration and the risk of Alzheimer disease (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.97-1.51 for exposure up to 12 months and HR 1.39, 95% CI 0.69-2.79 for exposure greater than 12 months).
Men who receive androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of dementia and/or Alzheimer disease compared to men who do not receive androgen deprivation therapy; this was more pronounced when androgen deprivation therapy was given longer than 12 months.","['Alzheimer disease', 'androgen antagonists', 'dementia', 'prostatic neoplasms']",The Journal of urology,2020-08-29,"[{'lastname': 'Sari Motlagh', 'firstname': 'Reza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Quhal', 'firstname': 'Fahad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nKing Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mori', 'firstname': 'Keiichiro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Urology, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Miura', 'firstname': 'Noriyoshi', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Urology, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Aydh', 'firstname': 'Abdulmajeed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nKing Faisal Medical City, Abha, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Laukhtina', 'firstname': 'Ekaterina', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nInstitute for Urology and Reproductive Health, Sechenov University, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pradere', 'firstname': 'Benjamin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Urology, University Hospital of Tours, Tours, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Karakiewicz', 'firstname': 'Pierre I', 'initials': 'PI', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Prognostics and Health outcomes Unit, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Enikeev', 'firstname': 'Dmitry V', 'initials': 'DV', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Urology and Reproductive Health, Sechenov University, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Deuker', 'firstname': 'Marina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Shariat', 'firstname': 'Shahrokh F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nInstitute for Urology and Reproductive Health, Sechenov University, Moscow, Russia.\nDepartment of Urology, Weil Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Urology, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, Texas.\nKarl Landsteiner Institute of Urology and Andrology, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Urology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.\nDepartment of Special Surgery, Jordan University Hospital, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.\nEuropean Association of Urology Research Foundation, Arnhem, Netherlands.'}]",,,"A total of 14 studies were selected after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria.

12471214",Reproduction Function in Male Patients With Bardet Biedl Syndrome.,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy with a wide spectrum of symptoms due to primary cilia dysfunction, including genitourinary developmental anomalies as well as impaired reproduction, particularly in males. Primary cilia are known to be required at the following steps of reproduction function: (i) genitourinary organogenesis, (ii) in fetal firing of hypothalamo-pituitary axe, (iii) sperm flagellum structure, and (iv) first zygotic mitosis conducted by proximal sperm centriole. BBS phenotype is not fully understood.
This study explored all steps of reproduction in 11 French male patients with identified BBS mutations.
BBS patients frequently presented with genitourinary malformations, such as cryptorchidism (5/11), short scrotum (5/8), and micropenis (5/8), but unexpectedly, with normal testis size (7/8). Ultrasonography highlighted epididymal cysts or agenesis of one seminal vesicle in some cases. Sexual hormones levels were normal in all patients except one. Sperm numeration was normal in 8 out of the 10 obtained samples. Five to 45% of sperm presented a progressive motility. Electron microscopy analysis of spermatozoa did not reveal any homogeneous abnormality. Moreover, a psychological approach pointed to a decreased self-confidence linked to blindness and obesity explaining why so few BBS patients express a child wish.
Primary cilia dysfunction in BBS impacts the embryology of the male genital tract, especially epididymis, penis, and scrotum through an insufficient fetal androgen production. However, in adults, sperm structure does not seem to be impacted. These results should be confirmed in a greater BBS patient cohort, focusing on fertility.","['Bardet Biedl syndrome', 'genetic', 'male infertility', 'male reproduction', 'primitive ciliopathy']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2020-08-25,"[{'lastname': 'Koscinski', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire de Biologie de la Reproduction/CECOS Lorraine, Hôpitaux universitaires de Nancy, Nancy, France.\nUniversité de Lorraine, Inserm, NGERE, Nancy, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Mark', 'firstname': 'Manuel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France.\nLaboratoire de Biologie de la Reproduction, Hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg (HUS), Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Messaddeq', 'firstname': 'Nadia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Braun', 'firstname': 'Jean-Jacques', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Service ORL et CCF, Hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg (HUS), Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Celebi', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire de Biologie de la Reproduction, Hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg (HUS), Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Muller', 'firstname': 'Jean', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Laboratoire de Génétique Médicale, INSERM, UMRS_1112, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg (FMTS), Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de médecine de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.\nLaboratoires de Diagnostic Génétique, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Strasbourg, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Zinetti-Bertschy', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Pôle de Psychiatrie, Santé Mentale et Addictologie, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.\nNeuropsychologie cognitive et physiopathologie de la schizophrénie, Unité de recherche INSERM U1114, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg (FMTS), Université de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Goetz', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Filière SENSGENE, Centre de Référence pour les affections rares en génétique ophtalmologique (CARGO), Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Dollfus', 'firstname': 'Hélène', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Laboratoire de Génétique Médicale, INSERM, UMRS_1112, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg (FMTS), Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de médecine de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.\nLaboratoires de Diagnostic Génétique, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Strasbourg, France.\nFilière SENSGENE, Centre de Référence pour les affections rares en génétique ophtalmologique (CARGO), Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.\nService de Génétique Médicale, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Strasbourg, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Rossignol', 'firstname': 'Sylvie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Laboratoire de Génétique Médicale, INSERM, UMRS_1112, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg (FMTS), Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de médecine de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.\nLaboratoires de Diagnostic Génétique, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Strasbourg, France.\nService de Génétique Médicale, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Institut de Génétique Médicale d'Alsace (IGMA), Strasbourg, France.\nService de Pédiatrie, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.""}]",,,"BBS patients frequently presented with genitourinary malformations, such as cryptorchidism (5/11), short scrotum (5/8), and micropenis (5/8), but unexpectedly, with normal testis size (7/8).

Given the well-known effects of physical activity and sex hormones on cognitive functions and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the present study examined the effects of treadmill exercise, sex hormones, and the combined treatment on learning and memory and hippocampal BDNF levels in transient congenital hypothyroid rats. To induce hypothyroidism, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil was added to the drinking water from the 6th day of gestation to the 21st postnatal day (PND). From PNDs 28 to 47, female and male pup rats received 17β-estradiol and testosterone, respectively, and about 30 min later, they were forced to run on the treadmill for 30 min once a day. On PNDs 48-55, spatial learning and memory of all rats tested in the water maze, which followed by measurement of BDNF in the hippocampus. Results showed that developmental hypothyroidism induced significant deficits in spatial learning and memory and hippocampal BDNF in both male and female rats. In both male and female hypothyroid rats, exercise and exercise plus sex hormones, but not sex hormones alone alleviated learning and memory deficits and all treatments (exercise, sex hormones, and the combined treatment) increased hippocampal BDNF. These disconnects in the effects of exercise, sex hormones and the combined treatment on behavioral and neurochemical outcomes suggest that a neurochemical mechanism other than hippocampal BDNF might contribute in the ameliorating effects of exercise on learning and memory deficits induced by developmental thyroid hormone insufficiency.",[],Behavioural pharmacology,2020-08-23,"[{'lastname': 'Rashidy-Pour', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of Physiology, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan.'}, {'lastname': 'Derafshpour', 'firstname': 'Leila', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Research Center, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia.'}, {'lastname': 'Vafaei', 'firstname': 'Abbas Ali', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of Physiology, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan.'}, {'lastname': 'Bandegi', 'firstname': 'Ahmad Reza', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of Physiology, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.'}, {'lastname': 'Kashefi', 'firstname': 'Adel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of Physiology, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sameni', 'firstname': 'Hamid Reza', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of Nervous System Stem Cell, Semnan University of Medical sciences, Semnan.'}, {'lastname': 'Jashire-Nezhad', 'firstname': 'Nahid', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Research Center of Nervous System Stem Cell, Semnan University of Medical sciences, Semnan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saboory', 'firstname': 'Ehsan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Research Center, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia.'}, {'lastname': 'Panahi', 'firstname': 'Yosef', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.'}]",,,,,10.1097/FBP.0000000000000572,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df0c1130>,,,,,,

18664536",How Does Androgen Deprivation Therapy Affect Mental Health including Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients with Prostate Cancer?,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is used to block the release of androgen in prostate cancer to promote the regression of cancer cells, and hence, disease progression. Its indication has been widened from the metastatic setting to the localized setting in prostate cancer. Long-term ADT for suppressing androgen release leads to a rapid decrease in androgen, termed as andropause, resulting in several dose and duration dependent adverse effects, including cognitive dysfunction such as dementia. Many retrospective and prospective studies, as well as meta-analyses, have attempted to confirm the crucial relationship between ADT and cognitive dysfunction, but pro and contrary opinions regarding this issue are ongoing owing to the absence of randomized controlled trials. Additionally, several recent studies have suggested the negative effects of dose- and duration-dependent ADT on cognitive dysfunction, especially in 40-65-year-old patients with prostate cancer, who are currently active workers in the society. This review article discusses several studies examining the influence of ADT on mental health based on diverse significant perspectives, especially cognitive dysfunction.","['Androgens', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Hormone therapy', 'Prostatic neoplasms']",The world journal of men's health,2020-08-11,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Hyung Ho', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Department Urology, Urological Cancer Center, Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Sahyun', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department Urology, Urological Cancer Center, Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Joung', 'firstname': 'Jae Young', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department Urology, Urological Cancer Center, Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Sung Han', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department Urology, Urological Cancer Center, Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea. 12112@ncc.re.kr.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2021 Korean Society for Sexual Medicine and Andrology.,"10.5534/wjmh.200092

30794079",Testosterone and Resting State Connectivity of the Parahippocampal Gyrus in Men With History of Deployment-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of low testosterone level on whole-brain resting state (RS) connectivity in male veterans with symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatiguability, pain, anxiety, irritability, or aggressiveness persisting after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Follow-up analyses were performed to determine if sleep scores affected the results.
In our cross-sectional design study, RS magnetic resonance imaging scans on 28 veterans were performed, and testosterone, sleep quality, mood, and post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured. For each participant, we computed the average correlation of each voxel's time-series with the rest of the voxels in the brain, then used AFNI's 3dttest++ on the group data to determine whether the effects of testosterone level on whole-brain connectivity were significant. We then performed follow-up region of interest-based RS analyses of testosterone, with and without sleep quality as a covariate. The study protocol was approved by the National Institute of Health's Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board.
Sixteen participants reported repeated blast exposure in theater, leading to symptoms; the rest reported exposure to a single blast or a nonblast TBI. Thirty-three percent had testosterone levels <300 ng/dL. Testosterone level was lower in participants who screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder compared to those who screened negative, but it did not reach statistical significance. Whole-brain connectivity and testosterone level were positively correlated in the left parahippocampal gyrus (LPhG), especially in its connectivity with frontal areas, the lingual gyrus, cingulate, insula, caudate, and right parahippocampal gyrus. Further analysis revealed that the effect of testosterone on LPhG connectivity is only partially mediated by sleep quality. Sleep quality by itself had an effect on connectivity of the thalamus, cerebellum, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.
Lower testosterone levels were correlated with lower connectivity of the LPhG. Weaknesses of this study include a retrospective design based on self-report of mTBI and the lack of a control group without TBI. Without a control group or pre-injury testosterone measures, we were not able to attribute the rate of low testosterone in our participants to TBI per se. Also testosterone levels were checked only once. The high rate of low testosterone level that we found suggests there may be an association between low testosterone level and greater post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms following deployment, but the causality of the relationships between TBI and deployment stress, testosterone level, behavioral symptomatology, and LPhG connectivity remains to be determined. Our study on men with persistent symptoms postdeployment and post-mTBI may help us understand the role of low testosterone and sleep quality in persistent symptoms and may be important in developing therapeutic interventions.

In 2008 the US housing bubble burst, causing the global economy to suffer for 4 years. While the 2008 crisis received considerable attention because of its global impact, in the 21st century alone, there have been more than 10 financial crises. While economic, political and legal analysis of the crises have dominated academia, this dissertation argues that an interdisciplinary approach to financial market analysis is required to better understand why they occur. This argument is based on the idea, that the choices of traders are at the core of this issue, and consequently an understanding of trader decision-making behavior was required. Economic models of decision-making are unable to explain this behavior, as they assume decision-making to be an entirely rational process. To address this limitation, findings in neuroscience, psychology and biology are considered. Using this approach, this chapter outlines the role of different neural mechanisms, gut-feelings and hormonal states, that facilitate irrational behavior and increase a trader's susceptibility to partake in bubble markets.","['Financial decision-making', 'Heuristics', 'Neuroeconomics', 'Trader behavior']",Progress in brain research,2020-08-11,"[{'lastname': 'Kabir', 'firstname': 'Syed Omar', 'initials': 'SO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Arts & Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.

31031117",Intrinsic excitation-inhibition imbalance affects medial prefrontal cortex differently in autistic men versus women.,"Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.
Autism is a condition that is usually diagnosed early in life that affects how a person communicates and socializes, and is often characterized by repetitive behaviors. One key theory of autism is that it reflects an imbalance in levels of excitation and inhibition in the brain. Excitatory signals are those that make other brain cells more likely to become active; inhibitory signals have the opposite effect. In non-autistic individuals, inhibitory activity outweighs excitatory activity. In people with autism, by contrast, an increase in excitatory activity is believed to produce an imbalance in excitation and inhibition. Most of the evidence to support this excitation-inhibition imbalance theory has come from studies of rare mutations that cause autism. Many of these mutations occur on the sex chromosomes or are influenced by androgen hormones (hormones that usually play a role on typically male traits). However, most people with autism do not possess these particular mutations. It was thus unclear whether the theory could apply to everyone with autism or, for example, whether it may better apply to specific groups of individuals based on their sex or gender. This is especially important given that about four times as many men and boys compared to women and girls are diagnosed with autism. Trakoshis, Martínez-Cañada et al. have now found a way to ask whether any imbalance in excitation and inhibition in the brain occurs differently in men and women. Using computer modeling, they identified a signal in brain scans that corresponds to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition. After showing that the technique works to identify real increases in excitation in the brain scans of mice, Trakoshis, Martínez-Cañada et al. looked for this signal, or biomarker, in brain scans of people with and without autism. All the people in the study identified with the gender that matched the sex they were assigned at birth. The results revealed differences between the men and women with autism. Men with autism showed an imbalance in excitation and inhibition in specific ‘social brain' regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, but women with autism did not. Notably, many of these brain regions are strongly affected by androgen hormones. Previous studies have found that women with autism are sometimes better at hiding or ‘camouflaging’ their difficulties when socializing or communicating than men with autism. Trakoshis, Martínez-Cañada et al. showed that the better a woman was at camouflaging her autism, the more her brain activity in this region resembled that of non-autistic women. Excitation-inhibition imbalance may thus affect specific brain regions involved in socializing and communication more in men who have autism than in women with the condition. Balanced excitation and inhibition in these brain areas may enable some women with autism to camouflage their difficulties socializing or communicating. Being able to detect imbalances in activity using standard brain imaging could be useful for clinical trials. Future studies could use this biomarker to monitor responses to drug treatments that aim to adjust the balance between excitation and inhibition.","['autism', 'excitation', 'fMRI', 'heterogeneity',

211,32717656,Interactive role of endocrine stress systems and reproductive hormones in the effects of stress on declarative memory.,"The effects of stress on memory performance, and the neuroendocrine mechanisms mediating such effects, are not well understood. Given the interrelationship between reproductive hormones and both the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-A), we examined their combined effect on stress-induced modulation of declarative memory. Before and after exposure either to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) procedure or to a non-stress condition, 112 participants completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. We analyzed participants' HPA-A and SNS reactivity by measuring cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA, an SNS activation marker) in four saliva samples. In addition, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone were sampled prior to the stress exposure. Exposure to the TSST attenuated memory recall after an introduction of an interference list during the declarative memory task. Importantly, controlling for testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone diminished this effect of stress, suggesting the importance of baseline reproductive hormones in stress-induced modulation of memory functions. Furthermore, a multiple regression model revealed that stress-induced declines in memory performance were negatively associated with participants' stress-induced cortisol reactivity, but only among individuals with high testosterone levels. In addition, stress-induced declines in memory performance were negatively associated with participants' stress-induced increases in sAA, but only in individuals with low progesterone levels. These findings suggest that the effects of stress on memory performance may be modulated by baseline reproductive hormones and provide a preliminary indication for specific modulatory interrelationships between reproductive hormones and neuroendocrine stress mechanisms in mediating the effects of stress on memory.","['Alpha-amylase', 'Cortisol', 'Memory', 'Reproductive hormones', 'Trier social stress test']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Cohen', 'firstname': 'Ami', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, The Max Stern Yezreel Valley College, Israel.

212,32700462,Role of testosterone in cognition and mobility of aging men.,"Cognitive decline and impairment of physical performance and mobility are age-related clinical problems with major negative impact on quality of life of elderly men. In how far the decline of testosterone production contributes to these problems in older men and whether testosterone therapy can contribute to slow down, prevent, or reverse their development remains subjects of debate.
This narrative review presents the current knowledge on association of sex steroid status with cognitive decline and impairment of physical function and mobility in elderly men and on the effects of testosterone therapy on cognition and on physical performance and mobility in elderly men.
The review is based on electronic database searches with primary focus on evidence from larger prospective observational studies and from controlled randomized trials, respectively.
In most observational studies, testosterone levels do not predict cognitive decline or development of Alzheimer's disease. In randomized trials, testosterone therapy did not significantly affect cognition in men with low or low-to-normal serum testosterone, regardless of whether they have preexisting cognitive impairment. Overall, observational data indicate that the usually moderate decline of androgen exposure in older men cannot fully account for the parallel decline of physical performance and mobility. Trials of testosterone therapy in older men with low or low-normal serum testosterone, whether they were generally healthy or suffered from physical function impairments, either did not show any effect on mobility and physical performance or showed limited effects of uncertain clinical relevancy.
The whole of the evidence tends to downplay the role of sex steroid status in the decline of cognitive function and impairment of physical function and mobility in older men. Based on the available evidence, prevention or treatment of cognitive decline or of impairment of mobility and physical function are not valid indications for testosterone treatment in older men with low or low-to-normal serum testosterone levels.","['ageing/aging', 'androgen and anti-androgens', 'cognition', 'hormone treatment', 'hypogonadism', 'physical performance']",Andrology,2020-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Kaufman', 'firstname': 'Jean-Marc', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Lapauw', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}]",,,"In most observational studies, testosterone levels do not predict cognitive decline or development of Alzheimer's disease.

213,32676884,A combination of an antioxidant with a prebiotic exerts greater efficacy than either as a monotherapy on cognitive improvement in castrated-obese male rats.,"Previous studies by ourselves and others have demonstrated that both obesity and testosterone deprivation have been related to cognitive decline. We have also shown that a prebiotic and n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) improved cognitive dysfunction in obese rats and castrated-male rats. However, the effects of NAC, a prebiotic (inulin), and a combination of the two on cognition in castrated-obese rats has never been investigated. The hypothesis was that NAC and inulin attenuated cognitive decline in castrated-obese rats by improving gut dysbiosis, and decreasing oxidative stress, glial activation and apoptosis. Male Wistar rats (n = 36) were fed with either a normal diet (ND: n = 6) or a high-fat diet (HFD: n = 30) for twenty-eight weeks. The resultant obese rats had a bilateral orchiectomy (ORX) and were randomly divided into five subgroups (n = 6/ subgroup). Each subgroup was treated with one of five therapies: a vehicle; testosterone replacement (2 mg/kg/day); NAC (100 mg/kg); inulin (10%, w/w), or a combination of the NAC and inulin for four weeks. The results demonstrated that castrated-obese rats developed gut dysbiosis, metabolic disturbance, brain pathologies, and cognitive decline. All of the pathological conditions in the brain were ameliorated to an equal extent by testosterone replacement, NAC, and inulin supplementation. Interestingly, a combination of NAC and inulin had the greatest beneficial effect on cognitive function by synergistically reducing hippocampal inflammation and ameliorating glial dysmorphology. These findings suggest that a combination of NAC and inulin may confer the greatest benefits in improving cognitive function in castrated-obese male rats.","['Cognitive function', 'Inulin', 'N-acetyl cysteine', 'Obese-insulin resistance', 'Testosterone deprivation', 'Testosterone replacement']",Metabolic brain disease,2020-07-18,"[{'lastname': 'Chunchai', 'firstname': 'Titikorn', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Keawtep', 'firstname': 'Puntarik', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Arinno', 'firstname': 'Apiwan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Saiyasit', 'firstname': 'Napatsorn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Prus', 'firstname': 'Dillon', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Apaijai', 'firstname': 'Nattayaporn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Pratchayasakul', 'firstname': 'Wasana', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Nipon', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Siriporn C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand. siriporn.c@cmu.ac.th.\nDepartment of Oral Biology and Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand. siriporn.c@cmu.ac.th.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s11011-020-00603-5,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05defc3ae0>,,,,,,

27034724",Androgen deprivation therapy and side effects: are GnRH antagonists safer?,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists is the mainstay of advanced prostate cancer treatment. Both drug classes decrease levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH), thereby lowering testosterone to castrate levels. This is associated with adverse events (AEs), including cardiovascular (CV) disorders, bone fractures, metabolic dysfunction, and impaired cognitive function. This literature review discusses these AEs, with a focus on CV and bone-related events. A hypothesis-generating meta-analysis of six clinical trials showed a potentially increased risk for CV disorders with GnRH agonists versus the GnRH antagonist degarelix. While no study has directly compared GnRH agonists versus antagonists with a primary CV outcome, one hypothesis for this observation is that GnRH agonists lead to initial surges in FSH that may negatively impact CV health, whereas antagonists do not. GnRH agonists are associated with metabolic and cognitive AEs and while data are lacking for GnRH antagonists, no differences in risk are predicted. Other common AEs with ADT include injection site reactions, which are much more common with degarelix than with GnRH agonists, which may reflect differing administration and injection techniques. Future studies are needed to further evaluate and compare the safety profiles of GnRH agonists and antagonists, especially in patients with pre-existing CV disease and other co-morbidities. Physicians should carefully evaluate benefits and risks when prescribing ADT and ensure that side effects are well managed.","['androgen antagonists', 'metabolic syndrome', 'prostate cancer', 'safety']",Asian journal of andrology,2020-07-14,"[{'lastname': 'Freedland', 'firstname': 'Stephen J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.\nSection of Urology, Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC 27705, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abrahamsson', 'firstname': 'Per-Anders', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Skåne University Hospital, Lund University, Malmö 20502, Sweden.'}]",,,,,10.4103/aja.aja_22_20,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05defd75e0>,,,,,,

21145893",Contextual complexity of chemical signals in callitrichids.,"In nearly four decades our research and that of others on chemical signaling in callitrichid primates suggest a high degree of contextual complexity in both the use of signals and the response to these signals. We describe our research including observational field studies, behavioral bioassays (""playbacks""), functional imaging, and conditioning studies. Scent marking in both captivity and the wild is used for more than just territorial marking. Social contextual effects are seen in responses by subordinate females responding with ovulatory inhibition only to chemical signals from familiar dominant reproductive females. Males detect ovulation through changes in scent marks. Males responded behaviorally and hormonally to chemical signals of novel ovulating females as a function of their reproductive status (fathers, males paired with a female but not fathers, and single males). Multiple brain areas are activated in males by female chemical signals of ovulation including areas relating to memory, evaluation, and motivation. Furthermore, males can be conditioned to respond sexually to a nonsexual odor demonstrating that learning plays an important role in response to chemical signals. Male androgen and estrone levels changed significantly in response to infant chemical signals as a function of whether the males were fathers or not, whether the odors were from their own versus other infants, as well as the infant's stage of development. Chemical signals in callitrichids are providing a rich source of understanding the context and function of the chemical sensory system and its stimulation of neural, behavioral, and hormonal actions in the recipients.","['behavioral bioassays', 'chemical signals', 'cognition', 'conditioning', 'fMRI', 'hormonal', 'marmosets', 'neural', 'tamarins']",American journal of primatology,2020-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Snowdon', 'firstname': 'Charles T', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.'}, {'lastname': 'Ziegler', 'firstname': 'Toni E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin.'}]",,,,© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"10.1002/ajp.23172

216,32640197,Risk-based decision making in rats: Modulation by sex and amphetamine.,"Decision-making is a complex process essential to daily adaptation in many species. Risk is an inherent aspect of decision-making and it is influenced by gonadal hormones. Testosterone and 17β-estradiol may modulate decision making and impact the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway. Here, we explored sex differences, the effect of gonadal hormones and the dopamine agonist amphetamine on risk-based decision making. Intact or gonadectomised (GDX) male and female rats underwent to a probabilistic discounting task. High and low doses of testosterone propionate (1.0 or 0.2 mg) and 17β-estradiol benzoate (0.3 μg) were administered to assess acute effects on risk-based decision making. After 3-days of washout period, intact and GDX rats received high or low (0.5 or 0.125 mg/kg) doses of amphetamine and re-tested in the probabilistic discounting task. Under baseline conditions, males made more risky choices during probability discounting compared to female rats, particularly in the lower probability blocks, but GDX did not influence risky choice. The high, but not the low dose, of testosterone modestly reduced risky decision making in GDX male rats. Conversely, 17β-estradiol had no significant effect on risky choice regardless of GDX status in either sex. Lastly, a higher dose of amphetamine increased risky decision making in both intact males and females, but had no effect in GDX rats. These findings demonstrated sex differences in risk-based decision making, with males showing a stronger bias toward larger, uncertain rewards. GDX status influenced the effects of amphetamine, suggesting different dopaminergic regulation in risk-based choices among males and females.","['17β-Estradiol', 'Amphetamine', 'Cognition', 'Decision-making', 'Gonadal hormones', 'Operant', 'Testosterone']",Hormones and behavior,2020-07-09,"[{'lastname': 'Islas-Preciado', 'firstname': 'Dannia', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Wainwright', 'firstname': 'Steven R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sniegocki', 'firstname': 'Julia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lieblich', 'firstname': 'Stephanie E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Yagi', 'firstname': 'Shunya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Floresco', 'firstname': 'Stan B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Galea', 'firstname': 'Liisa A M', 'initials': 'LAM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.

1391285",Theory of mind in users of anabolic androgenic steroids.,"Anabolic androgenic steroids are used to improve physical performance or increase lean muscle mass. About one-third of users develop a dependency syndrome, which is characterized by elevated rates of psychopathology, cognitive impairments, and aggressive and antisocial behaviors. The mechanisms behind these intra- and interpersonal problems are not known.
To examine theory of mind (ToM), i.e., the ability to infer the mental state of others, in users of anabolic androgenic steroids. Reduced ToM may be one factor underlying the interpersonal problems that have been reported with prolonged use of anabolic androgenic steroids.
The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) was used to assess ToM. Study participants were male/female weightlifters who used anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS, n = 34/9), who were dependent on anabolic androgenic steroids (AASdep, n = 44/7), and a non-using weightlifting comparison group (WLC, n = 69/16).
Analyses of variance showed that the AASdep group performed significantly worse than the WLC group, for all MASC measures (total ToM, cognitive ToM, affective ToM, overmentalizing/undermentalizing errors). Sex and sex x group interaction effects were non-significant.
Male and female weightlifters who were dependent on anabolic androgenic steroids had impaired ToM. Their reduced social cognition may be one contributing factor to the elevated rates of antisocial behavior reported in this population.","['Dependence', 'Mentalizing', 'Mindreading', 'Social cognition', 'Testosterone']",Psychopharmacology,2020-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Vaskinn', 'firstname': 'Anja', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research, Division Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, PO Box 4956, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway. anja.vaskinn@medisin.uio.no.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, PO Box 1171, Blindern, 0318, Oslo, Norway. anja.vaskinn@medisin.uio.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Hauger', 'firstname': 'Lisa E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, Division Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, PO Box 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Bjørnebekk', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, Division Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, PO Box 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,,"Analyses of variance showed that the AASdep group performed significantly worse than the WLC group, for all MASC measures (total ToM, cognitive ToM, affective ToM, overmentalizing/undermentalizing errors).

218,32623397,Development of Classification Models for the Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Utilizing Circulating Sex Hormone Ratios.,"While sex hormones are essential for normal cognitive health, those individuals with greater endocrine dyscrasia around menopause and with andropause are more likely to develop cognitive loss and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
To assess whether circulating sex hormones may provide an etiologically significant, surrogate biomarker, for cognitive decline.
Plasma (n = 152) and serum (n = 107) samples from age- and gender-matched AD and control subjects from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) were analyzed for 11 steroids and follicle-stimulating hormone. Logistic regression (LR), correlation analyses, and recursive partitioning (RP) were used to examine the interactions of hormones and hormone ratios and their association with AD. Models generated were then tested on an additional 43 ADRC samples.
The wide variation and substantial overlap in the concentrations of all circulating sex steroids across control and AD groups precluded their use for predicting AD. Classification tree analyses (RP) revealed interactions among single hormones and hormone ratios that associated with AD status, the most predictive including only the hormone ratios identified by LR. The strongest associations were observed between cortisol, cortisone, and androstenedione with AD, with contributions from progesterone and 17β-estradiol. Utilizing this model, we correctly predicted 81% of AD test cases and 64% of control test cases.
We have developed a diagnostic model for AD, the Wisconsin Hormone Algorithm Test for Cognition (WHAT-Cog), that utilizes classification tree analyses of hormone ratios. Further refinement of this technology could provide a quick and cheap diagnostic method for screening those with AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'blood', 'classification tree', 'diagnostic', 'follicle-stimulating hormone', 'hormone ratio', 'model', 'prediction', 'recursive partitioning', 'steroids']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Hayashi', 'firstname': 'Kentaro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzales', 'firstname': 'Tina K', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.\nGeriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Administration Hospital, Madison, WI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kapoor', 'firstname': 'Amita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Assay Services Unit and Institute for Clinical and Translational Research Core Laboratory, National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ziegler', 'firstname': 'Toni E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Assay Services Unit and Institute for Clinical and Translational Research Core Laboratory, National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Meethal', 'firstname': 'Sivan Vadakkadath', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Atwood', 'firstname': 'Craig S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.\nGeriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Administration Hospital, Madison, WI, USA.\nSchool of Exercise, Biomedical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA, Australia.'}]",,"We have developed a diagnostic model for AD, the Wisconsin Hormone Algorithm Test for Cognition (WHAT-Cog), that utilizes classification tree analyses of hormone ratios.

23088810",Androgens' effects on cerebrovascular function in health and disease.,"Androgens affect the cerebral vasculature and may contribute to sex differences in cerebrovascular diseases. Men are at a greater risk for stroke and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) compared to women throughout much of the lifespan. The cerebral vasculature is a target for direct androgen actions, as it expresses several sex steroid receptors and metabolizing enzymes. Androgens' actions on the cerebral vasculature are complex, as they have been shown to have both protective and detrimental effects, depending on factors such as age, dose, and disease state. When administered chronically, androgens are shown to be pro-angiogenic, promote vasoconstriction, and influence blood-brain barrier permeability. In addition to these direct effects of androgens on the cerebral vasculature, androgens also influence other vascular risk factors that may contribute to sex differences in cerebrovascular diseases. In men, low androgen levels have been linked to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, which greatly increase the risk of stroke and VCID. Thus, a better understanding of androgens' interactions with the cerebral vasculature under physiological and pathological conditions is of key importance.","['Androgens', 'Blood-brain barrier', 'Cerebral vasculature', 'Cerebrovascular disease', 'Dihydrotestosterone', 'Endothelial', 'Hormone therapy', 'Stroke', 'Testosterone', 'Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia']",Biology of sex differences,2020-07-02,"[{'lastname': 'Abi-Ghanem', 'firstname': 'Charly', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Robison', 'firstname': 'Lisa S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zuloaga', 'firstname': 'Kristen L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA. zuloagk@amc.edu.'}]",,,,,10.1186/s13293-020-00309-4,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05def5c9a0>,,,,,,
220,32602853,Effects of sex steroid hormones on memory.,"Many evidences have elucidated relevant mechanisms of action of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone on cognition, including learning and memory processes, both in animal models and humans. This influence may depend on their modulator role on several neurotransmitter systems, and the extensive presence of their receptors in cerebral areas, involved in cognitive functions, including the amygdala, hippocampal formation, and cerebral cortex. The present brief review summarizes data of our research and others with the aim of clarifying, in mammals, the involvement of sex hormones on memory. In particular, after an introduction illustrating the general mechanisms of sex hormones modulation on memory processes, the specific role of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in memory is described in three different sections. Besides summarizing the most relevant actions of sex steroid hormones in the modulation of learning and memory, in this review is also emphasized that many aspects and mechanisms are still not completely\r\nunderstood and extensive future research is necessary to elucidate them.",[],Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis,2020-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Pompili', 'firstname': 'Assunta', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy; assunta.pompili@cc.univaq.it.\nFondazione Santa Lucia, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Iorio', 'firstname': 'Carla', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Gasbarri', 'firstname': 'Antonella', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.\nFondazione Santa Lucia, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05deeb3720>,,,,,,

224,32574857,Testosterone and cortisol are negatively associated with ritualized bonding behavior in male macaques.,"Neuroendocrine research on the formation of social bonds has primarily focused on the role of nonapeptides. However, steroid hormones often act simultaneously to either inhibit or facilitate bonding. Testosterone is proposed to mediate a trade-off between male mating effort and nurturing behavior; therefore, low levels are predicted during periods of nurturing infant care and social bonding. In species where social bonding and support regulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, we also expect glucocorticoid levels to be low during bonding periods. We investigated how immunoreactive urinary testosterone (iuT) and cortisol (iuC) were related to triadic male-infant-male interactions - a ritualized male bonding behavior - as well as infant care in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We collected >3000 h of behavioral observation data during full-day focal animal follows from 14 adult males and quantified iuT and iuC from 650 urine samples. iuT was negatively correlated with rates of triadic interactions within subjects, but positively correlated between subjects. iuC was negatively correlated with triadic interactions both within and between subjects. Time spent caring for infants was positively correlated to both iuT and iuC within subjects, but not between subjects. The observed negative relationship between iuT and triadic interactions within subjects may be beneficial to lower competitive tendencies between adult males and to not inhibit bond formation. However, the positive correlation of iuT with triadic interactions between subjects was unexpected. We speculate that it could be due to a link between triadic interactions and coalition formation. A negative relationship between triadic interactions and iuC could reflect increased bonding and perceived social support as triadic interactions predict future coalition formation in this species, or reflect buffered tensions between males. The positive relationship of iuT and iuC with infant care suggests that the handling of infants may be less nurturing but rather protective or competitive in this species. Measuring steroid hormones in relation to bonding and nurturing can help us interpret behaviors within the ecological contexts that they occur.","['Barbary macaque', 'Cortisol', 'Social bond', 'Steroid/peptide theory', 'Testosterone', 'Triadic male-infant-male interaction']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-06-24,"[{'lastname': 'Rincon', 'firstname': 'Alan V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioral Ecology, Johann-Friedrich-Blumenbach Institute for Zoology and Anthropology, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany; Leibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition, Goettingen, Germany.

26891883",Estrogen Formation and Inactivation Following TBI: What we Know and Where we Could go.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is responsible for various neuronal and cognitive deficits as well as psychosocial dysfunction. Characterized by damage inducing neuroinflammation, this response can cause an acute secondary injury that leads to widespread neurodegeneration and loss of neurological function. Estrogens decrease injury induced neuroinflammation and increase cell survival and neuroprotection and thus are a potential target for use following TBI. While much is known about the role of estrogens as a neuroprotective agent following TBI, less is known regarding their formation and inactivation following damage to the brain. Specifically, very little is known surrounding the majority of enzymes responsible for the production of estrogens. These estrogen metabolizing enzymes (EME) include aromatase, steroid sulfatase (STS), estrogen sulfotransferase (EST/SULT1E1), and some forms of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B) and are involved in both the initial conversion and interconversion of estrogens from precursors. This article will review and offer new prospective and ideas on the expression of EMEs following TBI.","['HSD17B', 'TBI', 'androgen', 'aromatase', 'estrogen', 'sulfatase']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020-06-18,"[{'lastname': 'Duncan', 'firstname': 'Kelli A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology and Program in Neuroscience and Behavior, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY, United States.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2020 Duncan.,"10.3389/fendo.2020.00345

226,32544773,Hormonal and modality specific effects on males' emotion recognition ability.,"Successful emotion recognition is a key component of human socio-emotional communication skills. However, little is known about the factors impacting males' accuracy in emotion recognition tasks. This pre-registered study examined potential candidates, focusing on the modality of stimulus presentation, emotion category and individual baseline hormone levels. In an additional exploratory analysis, we examined the association of testosterone x cortisol interaction with recognition accuracy and reaction times. We obtained accuracy and reaction time scores from 282 males who categorized voice, face and voice-face stimuli for nonverbal emotional content. Results showed that recognition accuracy was significantly higher in the audio-visual than in the auditory or visual modality. While Spearman's rank correlations showed no significant association of testosterone (T) with recognition accuracy or with response times for specific emotions, the logistic and linear regression models uncovered some evidence for a positive association between T and recognition accuracy as well as between cortisol (C) and reaction time. In addition, the overall effect size of T by C interaction with recognition accuracy and reaction time was significant, but small. Our results establish that audio-visual congruent stimuli enhance recognition accuracy and provide novel empirical support by showing that the interaction of testosterone and cortisol relates to males' accuracy and response times in emotion recognition tasks.","['Cortisol', 'Dual-hormone hypothesis', 'Emotion recognition', 'Facial expressions', 'Prosody', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Lausen', 'firstname': 'Adi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Affective Neuroscience and Psychophysiology, Institute of Psychology, University of Goettingen, 37073 Goettingen, Germany; Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, United Kingdom; Leibniz ScienceCampus ""Primate Cognition"", 37077 Goettingen, Germany.

19359476","Testicular function in boys with 47,XYY and relationship to phenotype.","An additional Y chromosome occurs in ~1 in 1,000 males, resulting in the karyotype 47,XYY. The phenotype includes tall stature, hypotonia, neuropsychiatric comorbidities, and an increased risk of infertility in adulthood. Little is known about testicular function in childhood and adolescence in 47,XYY. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess testicular function serum biomarkers, including total testosterone, inhibin B, and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), in 82 boys with XYY (11.3 ± 3.8 years) compared with 66 male controls (11.6 ± 3.8 years). The association of testicular hormones with physical features, neuropsychological phenotype, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) was assessed with multiple linear regression models. Results indicate males with XYY have significantly lower inhibin B (median 84 pg/ml vs. 109 pg/ml, p = .004) and higher AMH (median 41 ng/ml vs. 29 ng/ml, p = .011); however, testosterone, testicular volume, and stretched penile length were not different from controls. In the exploratory analysis of relationships between hormone concentrations and phenotypic assessments, higher inhibin B concentrations were positively correlated with lower BMI and better cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes in the XYY group. Testosterone concentrations were positively associated with better behavioral outcomes in boys with XYY. Higher testosterone and inhibin B concentrations were also associated with shorter auditory latencies measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in XYY. With a few exceptions, testicular hormones were not associated with phenotypic outcomes in controls. In conclusion, there is evidence of subtle impaired testicular function in boys with XYY and a newly described relationship between measures of testicular function and some aspects of the XYY phenotype.","['Sertoli cell function', 'XYY syndrome', 'infertility', 'inhibin b', 'testicular insufficiency']","American journal of medical genetics.

228,32539186,The impact of long-term androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive function and socioeconomic decision making in prostate cancer patients.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) enhances survival of advanced prostate cancer patients and is therefore used as a concomitant therapy. However, ADT has been reported to cause negative side effects on cognition and emotional processing. So far, research referred to the effects of short-term treatment. Since the brain may adapt to androgen deprivation, we were especially interested in the long-term effects of ADT on cognitive and socioeconomic decision making.
Participants underwent a battery of tests that have been associated with testosterone. We compared the results of three matched test groups: (1) prostate cancer patients with ADT up to 20 years, (2) prostate cancer controls without treatment and (3) healthy controls. We further measured the morning testosterone content in participants' saliva.
Testosterone concentration was positively associated with visuospatial performance across and within the test groups. Patients with long-term ADT showed an overall decline in cognitive performance. Compared with untreated patients, ADT was also associated with a reduced intergroup bias during socioeconomic decision making, which was in line with previous observations in young men suggesting that testosterone may promote ingroup favoritism. Finally, depression scores were increased in ADT, while quality of life was negatively associated with the treatment.
These findings conform to results made after short-term treatment. ADT promotes negative side effects on cognitive function. We also show for the first time that testosterone deprivation may affect socioeconomic decision making. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that these effects cannot outweigh the previously described advantages of ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer.","['androgen deprivation', 'androgens', 'cancer', 'cognition', 'economic decision making', 'mosaic test', 'oncology', 'prostate cancer', 'testosterone', 'ultimatum game']",Psycho-oncology,2020-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Holtfrerich', 'firstname': 'Sarah Katharina Charlotte', 'initials': 'SKC', 'affiliation': 'Neuroendocrinology and Human Biology Unit, Department of Biology, Institute of Zoology, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Knipper', 'firstname': 'Sophie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Martini-Clinic, Prostate Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Purwins', 'firstname': 'Janna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Neuroendocrinology and Human Biology Unit, Department of Biology, Institute of Zoology, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Castens', 'firstname': 'Jasmin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Neuroendocrinology and Human Biology Unit, Department of Biology, Institute of Zoology, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Beyer', 'firstname': 'Burkhard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Martini-Clinic, Prostate Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schlomm', 'firstname': 'Thorsten', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Martini-Clinic, Prostate Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.\nDepartment of Urology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Diekhof', 'firstname': 'Esther Kristina', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Neuroendocrinology and Human Biology Unit, Department of Biology, Institute of Zoology, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.'}]",,"These findings conform to results made after short-term treatment.

229,32512129,"Neurobehavioral, testicular and erectile impairments of chronic ketamine administration: Pathogenesis and ameliorating effect of N-acetyl cysteine.","Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, recently has spread as a recreational drug. Its abuse lead to neurobehavioral disturbance in addition to toxic effects on other body organs. To evaluate the toxic effects of chronic administration of low ketamine doses on the memory, testicles, and erection, explore its pathophysiology through oxidative stress mechanism and examine the ameliorating effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). A total of 40 male albino rats were assigned to control, vehicle, ketamine only I.P. (10 mg/kg), and ketamine (10 mg/kg) + NAC (150 mg/kg) groups. Assessment of memory affection and erectile function by Passive Avoidance, Novel Object Recognition, and copulatory tests were performed. Estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in serum and prefrontal & hippocampal homogenate, and luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone in serum were done. Prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and testes were collected for histopathology. Chronic ketamine administration induced significant memory deficits (P < 0.05), reduced erectile function (P < 0.05), severe hypospermatogenesis, increased MDA, reduced CAT, TAC levels in serum, and tissue homogenate (P < 0.05) and reduction of LH, and testosterone (P < 0.05). Treatment with NAC resulted in significant improvement of memory function, improved erectile function, and decrease in oxidative injury in both serum and tissue homogenates. Testosterone and LH levels exhibited significant difference between treatment groups and controls (P < 0.05). NAC reduced the deleterious histopathological changes. These data suggest that long-term ketamine affects short and long memory, induces erectile and testicular dysfunction through oxidative stress. Co-administration with NAC ameliorates these toxic effects.","['Addiction', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Ketamine', 'Memory', 'NMDA', 'Neurobehavioral', 'Oxidative damage', 'Testicular impairment']","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2020-06-09,"[{'lastname': 'El Shehaby', 'firstname': 'Doaa M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Forensic Medicine& Clinical Toxicology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'El-Mahdy', 'firstname': 'Reham I', 'initials': 'RI', 'affiliation': 'Medical Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.

230,32504693,Effects of dietary fatty acids on the social life of male Guinea pigs from adolescence to adulthood.,"Dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or saturated fatty acids (SFAs) differently modulates neurophysiological and behavioral functions in response to altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activity and an individual's development. In this context, an individual's social environment, including social interactions and social hierarchies, is closely related to hormone concentrations and possibly interacts with dietary fatty acid effects. We investigated if dietary supplementation with walnut oil (high in PUFAs) and coconut fat (high in SFAs), compared to a control group, affects body mass gain, cortisol and testosterone concentrations, plasma fatty acids, and social behavior in male domestic guinea pigs from adolescence to adulthood. For analyses of cortisol and testosterone concentrations, social interactions were included as covariates in order to consider effects of social behavior on hormone concentrations. Our results revealed that SFAs increased escalated conflicts like fights and stimulated cortisol and testosterone concentrations, which limited body mass gain and first-year survival. PUFAs did not remarkably affect social behavior and hormone concentrations, but enabled the strongest body mass gain, which probably resulted from an energetic advantage. Neither sociopositive nor agonistic behaviors explained age-specific differences in hormone concentrations between groups. However, a high number of subdominant individuals and lower testosterone concentrations were related to increased cortisol concentrations in adult PUFA males. Our findings demonstrate the importance of dietary fatty acids regarding behavioral and endocrine developmental processes and adaptations to the social environment by modulating HPA-axis function and body homeostasis.","['Mortality', 'Plasma testosterone', 'Polyunsaturated fatty acids', 'Saliva cortisol', 'Saturated fatty acids', 'Social behavior', 'Social hierarchy']",Hormones and behavior,2020-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Nemeth', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioral and Cognitive Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria.

Dexamethasone (DEX) is used in pregnancies at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) to prevent virilization in an affected female fetus. The safety and long-term consequences of prenatal DEX exposure on the brain are largely unknown.
We investigate whether first-trimester prenatal DEX treatment is associated with alterations in brain structure at adult age, and if these alterations are associated with DNA methylation, mood, and cognitive abilities.
T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging scans, from a single research institute, are compared between 19 (9 women) first-trimester DEX-treated individuals, at risk of CAH but not having CAH, and 43 (26 women) controls (age range, 16.0-26.4 years).
DEX-treated participants showed bilateral enlargement of the amygdala, increased surface area and volume of the left superior frontal gyrus, and widespread increased radial, mean, and axial diffusivity of white matter, in particular in the superior longitudinal fasciculi and corticospinal tracts. In the DEX-treated group, increased mean and radial diffusivity correlated with increased methylation of the promotor region of the FKBP5 gene. There were no group differences in cognition or in scales assessing depression or anxiety, and the relationship between brain structure and cognition did not differ between DEX-treated and controls.
First-trimester prenatal DEX treatment is associated with structural alterations of the brain at adult age, with an accompanying change in gene methylation. The findings add to the safety concerns of prenatal DEX treatment in the context of CAH.","['brain structure', 'cognition', 'dexamethasone', 'epigenetics', 'mood', 'prenatal treatment']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2020-06-05,"[{'lastname': ""Van't Westeinde"", 'firstname': 'Annelies', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Karlsson', 'firstname': 'Leif', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Nordenström', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Padilla', 'firstname': 'Nelly', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Division of Neonatology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Lajic', 'firstname': 'Svetlana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""}]",,,"DEX-treated participants showed bilateral enlargement of the amygdala, increased surface area and volume of the left superior frontal gyrus, and widespread increased radial, mean, and axial diffusivity of white matter, in particular in the superior longitudinal fasciculi and corticospinal tracts.

233,32413673,The effects of testosterone on the physiological response to social and somatic stressors.,"Higher testosterone levels in males have previously been linked to decreased stress reactivity, but in other cases, testosterone has been reported to increase the stress response. We addressed these inconsistencies in a placebo-controlled single-dose testosterone administration study, in which 120 male participants were randomly assigned to undergo a cold-pressor test (CPT, a non-social somatic stressor), a socially evaluated cold-pressor test (SECPT, a social-somatic stressor), or a lukewarm water test (LWT, a non-stressful control condition). Throughout the experiment, blood pressure and interbeat intervals were measured continuously, and saliva samples for hormonal analyses were taken repeatedly at predefined time points. When comparing the groups treated with placebo, the SECPT elicited a larger increase in the systolic blood pressure than CPT, in agreement with previous studies. However, testosterone administration altered this pattern. Compared to placebo, testosterone increased systolic blood pressure during the CPT, whereas the opposite effect was found during the SECPT. Cortisol reactivity was not affected by testosterone administration. The CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene was unrelated to the effects of testosterone on the stress response, but it was correlated with blood pressure across the whole sample. Our findings demonstrate that testosterone's effects on the stress response are dependent on the social context. Testosterone's ability to flexibly influence the response to stressors may be an important mechanism through which the hormone promotes adaptive behavior. Our results are also in line with research showing that testosterone decreases social anxiety and suggest it may help to modulate the effects of stress in socially challenging situations.","['Blood pressure', 'Cold-pressor test', 'Cortisol', 'Heart rate variability', 'Stress', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-05-16,"[{'lastname': 'Kutlikova', 'firstname': 'Hana H', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychopharmacology and Biopsychology Unit, Department of Cognition, Emotion, and Methods in Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna, Liebiggasse 5, 1010 Vienna, Austria.

21177660",Androgens In Men Study (AIMS): protocol for meta-analyses of individual participant data investigating associations of androgens with health outcomes in men.,"This study aims to clarify the role(s) of endogenous sex hormones to influence health outcomes in men, specifically to define the associations of plasma testosterone with incidence of cardiovascular events, cancer, dementia and mortality risk, and to identify factors predicting testosterone concentrations. Data will be accrued from at least three Australian, two European and four North American population-based cohorts involving approximately 20 000 men.
Eligible studies include prospective cohort studies with baseline testosterone concentrations measured using mass spectrometry and 5 years of follow-up data on incident cardiovascular events, mortality, cancer diagnoses or deaths, new-onset dementia or decline in cognitive function recorded. Data for men, who were not taking androgens or drugs suppressing testosterone production, metabolism or action; and had no prior orchidectomy, are eligible. Systematic literature searches were conducted from 14 June 2019 to 31 December 2019, with no date range set for searches. Aggregate level data will be sought where individual participant data (IPD) are not available. One-stage IPD random-effects meta-analyses will be performed, using linear mixed models, generalised linear mixed models and either stratified or frailty-augmented Cox regression models. Heterogeneity in estimates from different studies will be quantified and bias investigated using funnel plots. Effect size estimates will be presented in forest plots and non-negligible heterogeneity and bias investigated using subgroup or meta-regression analyses.
Ethics approvals obtained for each of the participating cohorts state that participants have consented to have their data collected and used for research purposes. The Androgens In Men Study has been assessed as exempt from ethics review by the Human Ethics office at the University of Western Australia (file reference number RA/4/20/5014). Each of the component studies had obtained ethics approvals; please refer to respective component studies for details. Research findings will be disseminated to the scientific and broader community via the publication of four research articles, with each involving a separate set of IPD meta-analyses (articles will investigate different, distinct outcomes), at scientific conferences and meetings of relevant professional societies. Collaborating cohort studies will disseminate findings to study participants and local communities.

15890350",Possible effects of low testosterone levels on olfactory function in males.,"Functions attributed to androgens have increased, ranging from the role in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and reproductive behaviors to modulation of cognition, mood and some other functions. Sex differences and changes in circulating sex hormones affect human sensory function. In the literature, authors reported this kind of influence for olfaction predominantly in females.
To investigate the effects of low testosterone levels on olfactory functions in males, in this prospective clinical study.
Male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer were included. Thirty-nine patients with prostate cancer whose testosterone levels were lower than 50ng/dL due to castration, were the study group. Thirty-one patients with prostate cancer who were not castrated with testosterone levels higher than 50ng/dL were selected as the control group. Acoustic rhinometry and peak nasal inspiratory flow tests were performed for all participants; and for evaluation of olfactory function, both groups completed the Connecticut chemosensory clinical research center olfactory test.
The mean ages of the patients and controls were 69.6±7.2 (57-89) and 66.3±5.8 (50-78) years, respectively (p=0.039). There was a significant difference between groups in terms of testosterone levels (p<0.0001). The multivariate logistic regression revealed testosterone level as the only predictive factor determining the difference between the groups. In terms of olfactory parameters, all scores were lower in the emasculated group (butanol threshold test p=0.019, identification p=0.059, and Connecticut center score p=0.029) There was a significant correlation between testosterone levels and olfactory parameters (p=0.023; p=0.025 for identification and Connecticut center scores, respectively).

236,32338850,Are physical and mental abilities of older people related to gonadotropins and steroid hormones levels?,"Aging is characterized by deep alterations of hormone secretion. In majority, hormone secretion, except gonadotropins, undergoes a pronounced decrease which is thought to contribute to the progression of aging. The recent data indicate that gonadotropin excess may also by itself influence the aging process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relations between gonadotropins and steroid hormones with physical and mental abilities of older people.
In a group of patients aged over 75 years, concentrations of FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone, DHEAs and cortisol were measured. The mental ability was estimated by MMSE and CDT and the physical ability by TUG and SPPB tests.
The positive correlation between SPPB scores and FSH and the negative correlations of SPPB with LH/FSH ratio were observed in men. The correlation of TUG scores and estradiol levels was also noted in men. The positive correlation between CDT scores and FSH in women and the negative correlation between CDT and LH/FSH ratio in men were found. The correlation between the results of CDT and cortisol levels in men was also observed. Thus, we did not confirm the simple deleterious effect of gonadotropins on cognitive abilities. FSH and LH seem exert different (antagonistic?) effects on cognitive functions, but this hypothesis needs further studies.",[],Neuro endocrinology letters,2020-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Pawlikowski', 'firstname': 'Marek', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunoendocrinology, Chair of Endocrinology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kostka', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Chair of Geriatrics, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pisarek', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroendocrinology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Piglowska', 'firstname': 'Malgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Chair of Geriatrics, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Świętosławski', 'firstname': 'Jacek', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroendocrinology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chrzastek', 'firstname': 'Zuzanna', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Chair of Geriatrics, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sosowska', 'firstname': 'Natalia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Chair of Geriatrics, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Winczyk', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroendocrinology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.'}]",,,,,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ded37e00>,,,,,,

29878857",Animal Models to Understand the Etiology and Pathophysiology of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"More than 1 out of 10 women worldwide are diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the leading cause of female reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. Despite its high prevalence, PCOS and its accompanying morbidities are likely underdiagnosed, averaging > 2 years and 3 physicians before women are diagnosed. Although it has been intensively researched, the underlying cause(s) of PCOS have yet to be defined. In order to understand PCOS pathophysiology, its developmental origins, and how to predict and prevent PCOS onset, there is an urgent need for safe and effective markers and treatments. In this review, we detail which animal models are more suitable for contributing to our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of PCOS. We summarize and highlight advantages and limitations of hormonal or genetic manipulation of animal models, as well as of naturally occurring PCOS-like females.","['adipogenic constraint-induced lipotoxicity', 'androgen excess', 'developmental programming', 'genetic manipulation', 'naturally hyperandrogenic female monkeys', 'therapeutic prevention']",Endocrine reviews,2020-04-21,"[{'lastname': 'Stener-Victorin', 'firstname': 'Elisabet', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Padmanabhan', 'firstname': 'Vasantha', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Environmental Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Walters', 'firstname': 'Kirsty A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': ""Fertility & Research Centre, School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Rebecca E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Neuroendocrinology and Department of Physiology, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Benrick', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nSchool of Health Sciences and Education, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Giacobini', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'University of Lille, Inserm, CHU Lille, U1172 - LilNCog - Lille Neuroscience & Cognition, F-59000 Lille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Dumesic', 'firstname': 'Daniel A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbott', 'firstname': 'David H', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.'}]",,,,© Endocrine Society 2020.,"10.1210/endrev/bnaa010

238,32248652,Controversial aspects of testosterone in the regulation of sexual function in late-onset hypogonadism.,"Testosterone (T) plays a pivotal role in coordinating a series of psychological, cognitive and physical events that might (or might not) culminate in male sexual activity. In fact, T deficiency is associated, in a statistically significant way, with several sexual dysfunctions including erectile dysfunction (ED), reduction of spontaneous erection and hypoactive sexual desire (HSD). Although these associations are statistically significant, there is debate if they are also clinically meaningful. In addition, sexual dysfunctions are present also in several metabolic conditions - such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity - that often associate with low T. In particular, this is the case of ED, but not of HSD, that, therefore, should be considered a more genuine correlate of T deficiency in adulthood and aging (late-onset hypogonadism, LOH).
The aim of this review is to scrutinize evidence from our and other studies on sexual effects of T replacement therapy (TRT) in LOH.
We will use preclinical and clinical data coming from our and other laboratories and meta-analyses.
Intervention studies in clinical trials involving subjects with LOH, and their meta-analyses, indicate that TRT is able to ameliorate HSD, spontaneous erection and ED. However, the relative improvement of ED by TRT is marginal [2-3 points of International Index of Erectile Function-erectile function domain (IIEF-EFD)] and significantly smoothed in subjects with the aforementioned metabolic conditions. In LOH, positive effects of TRT on other domains of sexual activity, such as orgasm and sexual satisfaction, are also apparent in the different meta-analyses.
Hence, TRT is a reasonable treatment for restoring sexual drive in LOH, with some additional positive effects also on erection (spontaneous and sexual-related) and on orgasm. In contrast, preclinical and clinical studies indicate that T administration to eugonadal subjects does not improve male sexual activity.","['erection', 'late-onset hypogonadism', 'sexual desire', 'testosterone', 'therapy']",Andrology,2020-04-06,"[{'lastname': 'Maggi', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology Unit, Department of Experimental, Clinical and Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Filippi', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Interdepartmental Laboratory of Functional and Cellular Pharmacology of Reproduction, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", Department of NEUROFARBA, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Vignozzi', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Andrology, Female Endocrinology and Gender Incongruence Unit, Department of Experimental, Clinical and Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rastrelli', 'firstname': 'Giulia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Andrology, Female Endocrinology and Gender Incongruence Unit, Department of Experimental, Clinical and Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, Florence, Italy.'}]",,,"Intervention studies in clinical trials involving subjects with LOH, and their meta-analyses, indicate that TRT is able to ameliorate HSD, spontaneous erection and ED.

239,32222529,Age-dependent effects of testosterone on spatial memory in male rats.,"Decreased spatial memory is common in aging populations and reduces their quality of life. Although its role is still controversial, low testosterone (T) may contribute to impaired cognition in aged men. This study aimed to identify the role of T in age-related deficiencies in spatial memory among male rats. Young adult (3 months old) and aged (21 months old) Wistar rats were assigned to independent groups: intact, orchidectomized, or orchidectomized + subcutaneous pellets of T propionate. The phases of spatial memory acquisition (4 daily trials/4 days) and spatial memory retention (1 trial/day, 3 and 12 days after acquisition) were evaluated using the Barnes maze. Compared with young adults, aged intact rats took longer to find the goal, made more mistakes, and showed only slight improvements in goal sector exploration across the acquisition period. The young orchidectomized rats showed no improvement in performance over the days during the acquisition phase. T treatment in hormonally deprived old rats produced a small improvement in goal sector exploration and number of errors during the acquisition phase. Meanwhile, in young adults, this treatment improved the goal sector searching in the retention phase (12 days after acquisition training). Our results suggested that age-related spatial memory deficits cannot be entirely explained by the decline in T levels; however, this androgen produced subtle and mild beneficial effects on spatial memory in young and old males. Taken together, our findings suggest age differences in the role of T on spatial memory in males.","['Aging', 'Barnes maze', 'Memory', 'Orchidectomy', 'Testosterone']",Hormones and behavior,2020-03-31,"[{'lastname': 'Jiménez-Rubio', 'firstname': 'Graciela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorio de Farmacología Conductual, Dirección de Investigaciones en Neurociencias, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatría Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz, Calzada México-Xochimilco 101, Col.

22999654",Effects of Oral Contraceptive Androgenicity on Visuospatial and Social-Emotional Cognition: A Prospective Observational Trial.,"Oral contraceptives (OCs) containing estrogen and progesterone analogues are widely used amongst reproductive-aged women, but their neurocognitive impact is poorly understood. Preliminary studies suggest that OCs improve verbal memory and that OCs with greater androgenic activity may improve visuospatial ability. We sought to explore the cognitive impact of OCs by assessing performance of OC users at different stages of the OC cycle, and comparing this performance between users of different OC formulations according to known androgenic activity. We conducted a prospective, observational trial of OC users, evaluating cognitive performance with CogState software on two occasions: days 7-10 of active hormonal pill phase, and days 3-5 of the inactive pill phase (coinciding with the withdrawal bleed resembling menstruation). Thirty-five OC users (18 taking androgenic formulations, 17 taking anti-androgenic) were assessed. Analysis by androgenic activity showed superior performance by users of androgenic OCs, as compared to anti-androgenic OCs, in visuospatial ability and facial affect discrimination tasks. A growing understanding of cognitive effects of OC progestin androgenicity may have implications in choice of OC formulation for individuals and in future OC development.","['androgenicity', 'cognition', 'estrogen', 'oral contraceptive', 'progesterone', 'progestin']",Brain sciences,2020-03-29,"[{'lastname': 'Gurvich', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Monash Alfred Psychiatry research centre, Monash University Central Clinical School and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Warren', 'firstname': 'Annabelle M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Monash Alfred Psychiatry research centre, Monash University Central Clinical School and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Worsley', 'firstname': 'Roisin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Monash Alfred Psychiatry research centre, Monash University Central Clinical School and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hudaib', 'firstname': 'Abdul-Rahman', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Monash Alfred Psychiatry research centre, Monash University Central Clinical School and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Monash Alfred Psychiatry research centre, Monash University Central Clinical School and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kulkarni', 'firstname': 'Jayashri', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Monash Alfred Psychiatry research centre, Monash University Central Clinical School and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/brainsci10040194

241,32205812,Testosterone therapy and other treatment modalities for female sexual dysfunction.,"Recently in October 2019 a Global Consensus Position on the use of Testosterone Therapy for Women was published. The use of testosterone and other agents for female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is an important topic for the urologist focusing on sexual health. This review describes the known causes for FSD, and discusses the role of androgens in this disorder, the evidence for using testosterone treatment, and other current and emerging therapies.
A recent meta-analysis, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology evaluated a total of 36 randomized control trials spanning 1990-2018 and includes a total of 8480 patients. The primary findings were that testosterone therapy (TTh) increased sexual function including satisfactory sexual event frequency, sexual desire, pleasure, arousal, orgasm, responsiveness, and self-image when compared with either a placebo or drug-control (e.g., estrogen ± progestogen). In addition, TTh reduced sexual concerns and distress in postmenopausal women. Side effects included an increase in weight, acne, and hair growth, but there was no increase in serious adverse events. Importantly, TTh duration was greater than 12 weeks in all randomized control trials included in this meta-analysis.
TTh is effective to treat FSD in postmenopausal women. More data is required to evaluate the long-term safety data on the effects of TTh on cardiovascular health, breast health, cognitive function, and the musculoskeletal system in women.",[],Current opinion in urology,2020-03-25,"[{'lastname': 'Ingram', 'firstname': 'Catherine F', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Payne', 'firstname': 'Kelly S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Messore', 'firstname': 'Marisa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Scovell', 'firstname': 'Jason M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.\nDepartment of Urology, Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1097/MOU.0000000000000759,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05deca4360>,,,,,,
242,32113047,Endogenous testosterone levels are predictive of symptom reduction with exposure therapy in social anxiety disorder.,"The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG)-axis, and testosterone in particular, play an important role in social motivational behavior. Socially avoidant behavior, characteristic of social anxiety disorder (SAD), has been linked to low endogenous testosterone levels, and can be alleviated by testosterone administration in SAD. Although these beneficial effects of testosterone may translate to exposure therapy, it remains unknown whether testosterone increases prior to exposure improve therapy outcomes. In this proof-of-principle study, we tested whether pre-exposure (reactive and baseline) endogenous testosterone levels were predictive of exposure outcome in SAD. Seventy-three participants (52 females) with a principal SAD diagnosis performed four speech exposures: three during one standardized exposure therapy session and one at post-assessment one week later. Subjective fear levels were assessed before and after each speech exposure and social anxiety symptoms were assessed at pre- and post-treatment. Pre-treatment testosterone levels were assessed before (baseline) and in response to a pre-exposure instruction session (reactive). Pre-treatment testosterone levels were not related to fear levels during exposure therapy, but predicted pre- to post-treatment reductions in social anxiety symptom severity. Specifically, low baseline and high reactive pre-treatment testosterone levels were associated with larger reductions in social anxiety symptom severity. These findings support the role of HPG-axis in social fear reduction. Specifically, our finding that high reactive testosterone as well as low baseline testosterone predicted exposure outcome in SAD, suggests that good reactivity of the HPG-axis is a promising marker for the symptom-reducing effects of exposure therapy.","['Avoidance behavior', 'Challenge hypothesis', 'Endogenous testosterone', 'Exposure therapy', 'HPG-axis', 'Social anxiety disorder']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hutschemaekers', 'firstname': 'M H M', 'initials': 'MHM', 'affiliation': 'Overwaal Centre of Expertise for Anxiety Disorders, OCD and PTSD, Institution for Integrated Mental Health Care Pro Persona, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Tarweweg 2, 6534 AM Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, Montessorilaan 3, 6525 HR Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

243,32087283,Neuroprotection by dihydrotestosterone in LPS-induced neuroinflammation.,"Microglia-induced neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the etiology and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. The neuroprotective role of androgens, including testosterone and its metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT), has been increasingly demonstrated in these diseases, but few studies investigated the effects of androgen on neuroinflammation. This study investigated the role of DHT in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and behavioral dysfunction, as well as underlying mechanisms. We showed that DHT inhibited LPS-induced release of proinflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6; iNOS, COX-2, NO, and PGE2 in BV2 cells and primary microglia by suppressing the TLR4-mediated NF-κB and MAPK p38 signaling pathways, thus protecting SH-SY5Y neurons from inflammatory damage induced by activated microglia. In an LPS-induced neuroinflammation mouse model, endogenous DHT depletion by castration exacerbated inflammatory responses by upregulating the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 in the serum and brain by increasing the LR4-mediated NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation, but these effects were restored by exogenous DHT supplementation. Moreover, DHT also regulated the mRNA levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 in the brain. In addition, DHT modulated the expression of Aβ, the apoptotic proteins caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax, and synaptophysin, as well as neuronal damage in LPS-treated mouse brains. Further behavioral tests revealed that DHT ameliorated LPS-induced spatial and learning impairment and motor incoordination, and partly improved the locomotor activity in LPS-injected mice. Therefore, this study suggests that DHT exerts anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects; thus, androgen replacement therapy is a potential therapeutic strategy for improving cognitive and behavioral function in neuroinflammation-related diseases.","['Cognitive impairment', 'Dihydrotestosterone', 'Lipopolysaccharide', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Sickness behavior']",Neurobiology of disease,2020-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Jing'an District Central Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Renyuan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University 300070 Tianjin, China; Department of Urology, Jing'an District Central Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Jing'an District Central Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Pengfei', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Jing'an District Central Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Jing'an District Central Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Miao', 'firstname': 'Shuai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Jing'an District Central Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.

27147989",Changes in nucleus accumbens gene expression accompany sex-specific suppression of spontaneous physical activity in aromatase knockout mice.,"Aromatase catalyzes conversion of testosterone to estradiol and is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Suppression of aromatase adversely affects metabolism and physical activity behavior, but mechanisms remain uncertain. The hypothesis tested herein was that whole body aromatase deletion would cause gene expression changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain regulating motivated behaviors such as physical activity, which is suppressed with loss of estradiol. Metabolic and behavioral assessments were performed in male and female wild-type (WT) and aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice. NAc-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with RNAseq, and associations between the measured phenotypic traits were determined. Female ArKO mice had greater percent body fat, reduced spontaneous physical activity (SPA), consumed less energy, and had lower relative resting energy expenditure (REE) than WT females. Such differences were not observed in ArKO males. However, in both sexes, a top DEG was Pts, a gene encoding an enzyme necessary for catecholamine (e.g., dopamine) biosynthesis. In comparing male and female WT mice, top DEGs were related to sexual development/fertility, immune regulation, obesity, dopamine signaling, and circadian regulation. SPA correlated strongly with Per3, a gene regulating circadian function, thermoregulation, and metabolism (r = -0.64, P = .002), which also correlated with adiposity (r = 0.54, P = .01). In conclusion, aromatase ablation leads to gene expression changes in NAc, which may in turn result in reduced SPA and related metabolic abnormalities. These findings may have significance to post-menopausal women and those treated with an aromatase inhibitor.","['Aromatase', 'Brain', 'CYP19', 'Cognition', 'Metabolism', 'Sex differences', 'Spontaneous physical activity']",Hormones and behavior,2020-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Shay', 'firstname': 'Dusti A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Welly', 'firstname': 'Rebecca J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Givan', 'firstname': 'Scott A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Informatics Research Core Facility, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bivens', 'firstname': 'Nathan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'DNA Core Facility, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanaley', 'firstname': 'Jill', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall', 'firstname': 'Brittney L', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA; Biomedical Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lubahn', 'firstname': 'Dennis B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA; Department of Child Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosenfeld', 'firstname': 'Cheryl S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA; Biomedical Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA; Thompson Center for Autism and Neurobehavioral Disorders, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA; MU Informatics Institute, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vieira-Potter', 'firstname': 'Victoria J', 'initials': 'VJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211, MO, USA.

22201281",Testosterone synthesis in the female songbird brain.,"Decades of work have established the brain as a source of steroid hormones, termed 'neurosteroids'. The neurosteroid neuroestradiol is produced in discrete brain areas and influences cognition, sensory processing, reproduction, neurotransmission, and disease. A prevailing research focus on neuroestradiol has essentially ignored whether its immediate synthesis precursor - the androgen testosterone - is also dynamically regulated within the brain. Testosterone itself can rapidly influence neurophysiology and behavior, and there is indirect evidence that the female brain may synthesize significant quantities of testosterone to regulate cognition, reproduction, and behavior. In songbirds, acoustic communication is regulated by neuroestrogens. Neuroestrogens are rapidly synthetized in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) of the auditory cortex of zebra finches in response to song and can influence auditory processing and song discrimination. Here, we examined the in vivo dynamics of NCM levels of the neuroestrogen synthesis precursor, testosterone. Unlike estradiol, testosterone did not appear to fluctuate in the female NCM during song exposure. However, a substantial song-induced elevation of testosterone was revealed in the left hemisphere NCM of females when local aromatization (i.e., conversion to estrogens) was locally blocked. This elevation was eliminated when local androgen synthesis was concomitantly blocked. Further, no parallel elevation was observed in the circulation in response to song playback, consistent with a local, neural origin of testosterone synthesis. To our knowledge, this study provides the first direct demonstration that testosterone fluctuates rapidly in the brain in response to socially-relevant environmental stimuli. Our findings suggest therefore that locally-derived 'neuroandrogens' can dynamically influence brain function and behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrates that androgen synthesis occurs rapidly in vivo in the brain in response to social cues, in a lateralized manner. Specifically, testosterone synthesis occurs within the left secondary auditory cortex when female zebra finches hear male song. Therefore, testosterone could act as a neuromodulator to rapidly shape sensory processing. Androgens have been linked to functions such as the control of female libido, and many steroidal drugs used for contraception, anti-cancer treatments, and sexual dysfunction likely influence the brain synthesis and action of testosterone. The current findings therefore establish a clear role for androgen synthesis in the female brain with implications for understanding neural circuit function and behavior in animals, including humans.","['Aromatase', 'Communication', 'Microdialysis', 'Neurosteroids', 'Non-genomic', 'Songbirds']",Hormones and behavior,2020-02-18,"[{'lastname': 'de Bournonville', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Center for Neuroendocrine Studies, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States of America.

17707381",Timing of peripubertal steroid exposure predicts visuospatial cognition in men: Evidence from three samples.,"Experiments in male rodents demonstrate that sensitivity to the organizational effects of steroid hormones decreases across the pubertal window, with earlier androgen exposure leading to greater masculinization of the brain and behavior. Similarly, some research suggests the timing of peripubertal exposure to sex steroids influences aspects of human psychology, including visuospatial cognition. However, prior studies have been limited by small samples and/or imprecise measures of pubertal timing. We conducted 4 studies to clarify whether the timing of peripubertal hormone exposure predicts performance on male-typed tests of spatial cognition in adulthood. In Studies 1 (n = 1095) and 2 (n = 173), we investigated associations between recalled pubertal age and spatial cognition in typically developing men, controlling for current testosterone levels in Study 2. In Study 3 (n = 51), we examined the relationship between spatial performance and the age at which peripubertal hormone replacement therapy was initiated in a sample of men with Isolated GnRH Deficiency. Across Studies 1-3, effect size estimates for the relationship between spatial performance and pubertal timing ranged from. -0.04 and -0.27, and spatial performance was unrelated to salivary testosterone in Study 2. In Study 4, we conducted two meta-analyses of Studies 1-3 and four previously published studies. The first meta-analysis was conducted on correlations between spatial performance and measures of the absolute age of pubertal timing, and the second replaced those correlations with correlations between spatial performance and measures of relative pubertal timing where available. Point estimates for correlations between pubertal timing and spatial cognition were -0.15 and -0.12 (both p < 0.001) in the first and second meta-analyses, respectively. These associations were robust to the exclusion of any individual study. Our results suggest that, for some aspects of neural development, sensitivity to gonadal hormones declines across puberty, with earlier pubertal hormone exposure predicting greater sex-typicality in psychological phenotypes in adulthood. These results shed light on the processes of behavioral and brain organization and have implications for the treatment of IGD and other conditions wherein pubertal timing is pharmacologically manipulated.","['Hormones', 'Isolated GnRH Deficiency', 'Organizational effects', 'Pubertal timing', 'Visuospatial abilities']",Hormones and behavior,2020-02-16,"[{'lastname': 'Shirazi', 'firstname': 'Talia N', 'initials': 'TN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, Pennsylvania State University, Carpenter Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Self', 'firstname': 'Heather', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, Pennsylvania State University, Carpenter Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cantor', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Addition and Mental Health, 2 Carlton Street, suite 1820, Toronto, Ontario M5B 1J3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawood', 'firstname': 'Khytam', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, Moore Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cárdenas', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, Moore Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosenfield', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, Pennsylvania State University, Carpenter Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Triana', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Nipissing University, 100 College Drive, North Bay, Ontario P1B 8L7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Carré', 'firstname': 'Justin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Nipissing University, 100 College Drive, North Bay, Ontario P1B 8L7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'McDaniel', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Management, Virginia Commonwealth University, Arlington, VA 22209, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Blanchard', 'firstname': 'Ray', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 250 College, Toronto, Ontario M5T 1L8, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Balasubramanian', 'firstname': 'Ravikumar', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Reproductive Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Delaney', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Reproductive Physiology and Pathophysiology Group, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Crowley', 'firstname': 'William', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Reproductive Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Breedlove', 'firstname': 'S Marc', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Michigan State University. 240 Giltner Hall, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Puts', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, Pennsylvania State University, Carpenter Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA.

6791927",Postnatal Effects of Sex Hormones on Click-Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions: A Study of Adolescents with Gender Dysphoria.,"Click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) are echo-like sounds, generated by the inner ear in response to click-stimuli. A sex difference in emission strength is observed in neonates and adults, with weaker CEOAE amplitudes in males. These differences are assumed to originate from testosterone influences during prenatal male sexual differentiation and to remain stable throughout life. However, recent studies suggested activational, postnatal effects of sex hormones on CEOAEs. Adolescents diagnosed with gender dysphoria (GD) may receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) in order to suppress endogenous sex hormones and, therefore, pubertal maturation, followed by cross-sex hormone (CSH) treatment. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined whether hormonal interventions in adolescents diagnosed with GD (62 trans boys, assigned female at birth, self-identifying as male; 43 trans girls, assigned male at birth, self-identifying as female), affected their CEOAEs compared to age- and sex-matched controls (44 boys, 37 girls). Sex-typical differences in CEOAE amplitude were observed among cisgender controls and treatment-naïve trans boys but not in other groups with GD. Treatment-naïve trans girls tended to have more female-typical CEOAEs, suggesting hypomasculinized early sexual differentiation, in support of a prominent hypothesis on the etiology of GD. In line with the predicted suppressive effects of androgens, trans boys receiving CSH treatment, i.e., testosterone plus GnRHa, showed significantly weaker right-ear CEOAEs compared with control girls. A similar trend was seen in trans boys treated with GnRHa only. Unexpectedly, trans girls showed CEOAE masculinization with addition of estradiol. Our findings show that CEOAEs may not be used as an unequivocal measure of prenatal androgen exposure as they can be modulated postnatally by sex hormones, in the form of hormonal treatment.","['Click-evoked otoacoustic emissions', 'Estradiol', 'Gender dysphoria', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs', 'Sex differences', 'Testosterone']",Archives of sexual behavior,2020-02-15,"[{'lastname': 'Burke', 'firstname': 'Sarah M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Psychology, Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, 1081 HX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Developmental and Educational Psychology, Brain and Development Research Center, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Heesewijk', 'firstname': 'Jason O', 'initials': 'JO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Psychology, Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, 1081 HX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jason@l3q.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'Menks', 'firstname': 'Willeke M', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Klink', 'firstname': 'Daniel T', 'initials': 'DT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nPediatrics and Genetics Research Unit, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Kreukels', 'firstname': 'Baudewijntje P C', 'initials': 'BPC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Psychology, Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, 1081 HX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Cohen-Kettenis', 'firstname': 'Peggy T', 'initials': 'PT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Psychology, Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, 1081 HX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakker', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'GIGA Neuroscience, University of Liege, Liège, Belgium.'}]",,,,,"10.1007/s10508-020-01652-8

Approximately 85% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present after puberty with normal pubic hair and normal penile size but small testes, gynecomastia, and sterility resulting from azoospermia. Approximately 15% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present at birth with ambiguous genitalia. Gender role and gender identity are reported as male. If untreated, males with 46,XX testicular DSD experience the consequences of testosterone deficiency.
Diagnosis of nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD is based on the combination of clinical findings, endocrine testing, and cytogenetic testing. Endocrine studies usually show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to testicular failure. Cytogenetic studies at the 550-band level demonstrate a 46,XX karyotype.

However, less is known about sexual satisfaction and self-esteem as well as the relationship of these aspects of psychological function with clinical and hormonal profiles associated with PCOS. This cross-sectional study compared women with PCOS (N = 96) and healthy controls (N = 47). This study assessed sexual function (primary outcome), self-esteem, anxiety, and depression as well as evaluation of clinical, endocrine, and metabolic parameters. Overall, sexual satisfaction scores were comparable among women with and without PCOS. However, psychosexual function of women with PCOS exhibited distinguishing characteristics. The unconscious aspect of sexuality: frequency of erotic dreams, significantly correlated with free testosterone (ρ = 0.24, P = 0.03) and DHEAS (ρ = 0.31, P = 0.004) only in the PCOS group. In contrast, in women with PCOS, the frequency of masturbation did not correlate with endocrine profiles, but correlated with trait anxiety (ρ = 0.21, P = 0.049) and depression (ρ = 0.21, P = 0.05). Only one aspect of self-esteem (body appearance) was reduced in the PCOS group (P = 0.02) and was related to BMI and androgen. Women with PCOS had greater state anxiety (P = 0.02) and depression (P < 0.001); these scores correlated with BMI. However, anxiety and depression correlated with testosterone only in women without PCOS. The above findings indicate that PCOS is associated with a broad range of alterations of psychological function including psychosexual aspects; these alterations are in complex relationship with BMI and androgen levels.","['Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome', 'Self-esteem', 'Sexual satisfaction']","Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",2020-02-13,"[{'lastname': 'Glowinska', 'firstname': 'Aleksandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecological Oncology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-535, Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Duleba', 'firstname': 'Antoni J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Reproductive Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0633, USA. aduleba@ucsd.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Zielona-Jenek', 'firstname': 'Monika', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social and Clinical Sexology, Faculty of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences, Adam Mickiewicz University, Szamarzewskiego 89, 60-568, Poznań, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Siakowska', 'firstname': 'Martyna', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecological Oncology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-535, Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pawelczyk', 'firstname': 'Leszek', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecological Oncology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-535, Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Banaszewska', 'firstname': 'Beata', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecological Oncology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-535, Poznan, Poland.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s43032-019-00061-0,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df617590>,,,,,,

252,31954104,Effects of aging on testosterone and androgen receptors in the mesocorticolimbic system of male rats.,"As males age, systemic testosterone (T) levels decline. T regulates executive function, a collection of cognitive processes that are mediated by the mesocorticolimbic system. Here, we examined young adult (5 months) and aged (22 months) male Fischer 344 × Brown Norway rats, and measured systemic T levels in serum and local T levels in microdissected nodes of the mesocorticolimbic system (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). We also measured androgen receptor (AR) immunoreactivity (-ir) in the mesocorticolimbic system. As expected, systemic T levels decreased with age. Local T levels in mesocorticolimbic regions - except the VTA - also decreased with age. Mesocorticolimbic T levels were higher than serum T levels at both ages. AR-ir was present in the VTA, NAc, mPFC, and OFC and decreased with age in the mPFC. Taken together with previous results, the data suggest that changes in androgen signaling may contribute to changes in executive function during aging.","['Brain', 'Executive function', 'Medial prefrontal cortex', 'Neurosteroid', 'Nucleus accumbens', 'Orbitofrontal cortex', 'Ventral tegmental area']",Hormones and behavior,2020-01-19,"[{'lastname': 'Low', 'firstname': 'Katelyn L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomm', 'firstname': 'Ryan J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Chunqi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tobiansky', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Floresco', 'firstname': 'Stan B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Soma', 'firstname': 'Kiran K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

253,31943448,"Domain-specific contributions of biological sex and sex hormones to what, where and when components of episodic-like memory in adult rats.","Episodic memory involves the integration and recall of discrete events that include information about what happened, where it happened and when it occurred. Episodic memory function is critical to daily life, and its dysfunction is both a first identifiable indicator and an enduring core feature of cognitive decline in ageing and in neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Available evidence from human studies suggests that biological sex and sex hormones modulate episodic memory function in health and disease. However, knowledge of how this occurs is constrained by the limited availability and underutilization of validated animal models in investigating hormone impacts on episodic-like memory function. Here, adult female, adult male and gonadally manipulated adult male rats were tested on the what-where-when episodic-like memory task to determine whether rats model human sex differences in episodic memory and how the hormonal milieu impacts episodic-like memory processes in this species. These studies revealed salient ways in which rats model human sex differences in episodic memory, including a male advantage in spatial episodic memory performance. They also identified domain-specific roles for oestrogens and androgens in modulating what, where and when discriminations in male rats that were unlike those engaged in corresponding novel object recognition and novel object location tasks. These studies thus identify rats and the what-where-when task as suitable for investigating the neuroendocrine bases of episodic-like memory, and provide new information about the unique contributions that sex and sex hormones make to this complex mnemonic process.","['androgen', 'neuroendocrine', 'object recognition', 'oestrogen']",The European journal of neuroscience,2020-01-17,"[{'lastname': 'Conner', 'firstname': 'Meagan R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.\nDepartment of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Adeyemi', 'firstname': 'Oluwadamilola M', 'initials': 'OM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Anderson', 'firstname': 'Brenda J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kritzer', 'firstname': 'Mary F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.'}]",,,,© 2020 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/ejn.14676,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05daa458b0>,,,,,,
254,31928918,Testosterone Therapy: What We Have Learned From Trials.,"The role of testosterone (T) replacement therapy (TRT) in men is still conflicting. In particular, safety concerns and cardiovascular (CV) risk related to TRT have not been completely clarified yet. Similarly, the clear beneficial effects of TRT are far to be established.
To systematically and critically analyze the available literature providing evidence of the benefit-risk ratio derived from TRT in aging men.
A comprehensive PubMed literature search was performed to collect all trials, either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, evaluating the effects of TRT on different outcomes.
Whenever possible, data derived from RCTs were compared with those resulting from observational studies. In addition, a discussion of the available meta-analyses has been also provided.
Data derived from RCT and observational studies clearly documented that TRT can improve erectile function and libido as well as other sexual activities in men with hypogonadism (total T < 12 nM). Conversely, the effect of TRT on other outcomes, including metabolic, mood, cognition, mobility, and bone, is more conflicting. When hypogonadism is correctly diagnosed and managed, no CV venous thromboembolism or prostate risk is observed.
Before prescribing TRT, hypogonadism (total T < 12 nM) must be confirmed through an adequate biochemical evaluation. Potential contraindications should be ruled out, and an adequate follow-up after the prescription is mandatory.
When correctly diagnosed and administered, TRT is safe, and it can improve several aspects of sexual function. However, its role in complicated vasculogenic erectile dysfunction is limited. Conversely, TRT is not recommended for weight reduction and metabolic improvement. Further well-powered studies are advisable to better clarify TRT for long-term CV risk and prostate safety in complicated patients as well as in those curatively treated for prostate cancer.

255,31926079,Sexual motivation: problem solved and new problems introduced.,"Background During the past 50 years, motivational studies have evolved from the logical inference of logically required ""intervening variables"" to explain behavioral change, to electrophysiological and molecular analyses of the mechanisms causing such changes. Aim The purpose of this review article is two-fold: first to describe the logic of sexual motivation in a way that applies to laboratory animals as well as humans, and the second is to address some of the problems of sexual motivation experienced by men. Results When problems of motivational mechanisms are stripped down to their essentials, as performed in the laboratory animal models and are available for reductionistic studies, then the problems can be solved with certainty, as illustrated in the first part of this review. However, with respect to human sexual motivation, the various determinants which include so many behavioral routes and so many brain states come into play, that definite conclusions are harder to come by, as illustrated in the second part of this review. Conclusions This review highlights a number of key questions that merit further investigation. These include (a) What mechanisms do cultural and experiential influences interact with androgenic hormone influences on human sexual motivation? (b) How would epigenetic effects in the human brain related to changes in motivation be investigated? (c) What are the effects of unpredictable traumatic and stressful human experiences on sexual motivation; (d) How such mechanisms are activated upon unpredictable traumatic and stressful insults? (e) What are the outstanding differences between sexual motivational drive and motivations driven by homeostatic systems such as hunger and thirst?","['androgens', 'cognitive function', 'novelty seeking', 'sexual motivations', 'testosterone']",Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,2020-01-12,"[{'lastname': 'Pfaff', 'firstname': 'Donald', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neurobiology and Behavior, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saad', 'firstname': 'Farid', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Consultant to Medical Affairs Men's Health/Andrology, Bayer AG, Berlin, Muellerstr. 178, 13353 Berlin, Germany.""}]",,,,,10.1515/hmbci-2019-0055,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dea73d60>,,,,,,
256,31918180,Different androgen deprivation therapies might have a differential impact on cognition - An analysis from a population-based study using time-dependent exposure model.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the mainstay treatment for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer (PC). However, potential effects of ADT treatment on neurocognitive dysfunction remain unclear. The present study was conducted to assess the relation between ADT treatment and risk of cognitive decline in Asian men with PC.
A population-based cohort of 24,464 men with PC, each newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2008, was selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Subjects were further grouped by treatment as non-ADT (n = 4685) or ADT (n = 12,740), members of the latter subjected to bilateral orchiectomy or medical treatment (ie, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, antiandrogens, or combination therapy). A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model with ADT as time-dependent covariate was used to generate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of subsequent cognitive decline, including dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD).
ADT showed a significant association with overall risk of cognitive decline (HR = 1.51, 95 % CI: 1.31-1.74), especially for PD, dementia, and non-Alzheimer dementia (non-AZD). When stratified by various ADT regimens, antiandrogen-only recipients displayed significantly heightened risks of subsequent AD, non-AZD, and PD. However, combined androgen blockade also imposed an increased risk of PD. There was no apparent correlation between duration of ADT exposure and cognitive dysfunction.
Various ADT therapies may have disparate impacts on cognitive function. Prospective studies exploring pertinent clinical characteristics more fully are needed to confirm these findings.","['Alzheimer disease', 'Androgen deprivation therapy', 'Cognitive decline', 'Combined androgen blockade', 'Dementia', 'Prostate cancer', 'Time-dependent exposure model']",Cancer epidemiology,2020-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'Jian-Hua', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Urology, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

257,31905405,Testosterone Treatment in Adult Men With Age-Related Low Testosterone: A Clinical Guideline From the American College of Physicians.,"The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on the current evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.
The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.
The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.
ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient's preferences.
ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction in whom there is no improvement in sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).
ACP suggests that clinicians consider intramuscular rather than transdermal formulations when initiating testosterone treatment to improve sexual function in men with age-related low testosterone, as costs are considerably lower for the intramuscular formulation and clinical effectiveness and harms are similar.
ACP suggests that clinicians not initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).",[],Annals of internal medicine,2020-01-07,"[{'lastname': 'Qaseem', 'firstname': 'Amir', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'American College of Physicians, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (A.Q., I.E.).'}, {'lastname': 'Horwitch', 'firstname': 'Carrie A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Washington (C.A.H.).'}, {'lastname': 'Vijan', 'firstname': 'Sandeep', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan (S.V.).'}, {'lastname': 'Etxeandia-Ikobaltzeta', 'firstname': 'Itziar', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'American College of Physicians, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (A.Q., I.E.).'}, {'lastname': 'Kansagara', 'firstname': 'Devan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, Oregon (D.K.).'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Forciea', 'firstname': 'Mary Ann', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Crandall', 'firstname': 'Carolyn', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fitterman', 'firstname': 'Nick', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hicks', 'firstname': 'Lauri A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Jennifer S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Maroto', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McLean', 'firstname': 'Robert M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mustafa', 'firstname': 'Reem A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tufte', 'firstname': 'Janice', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.7326/M19-0882,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05deaa40e0>,,,,,,
258,31905375,Efficacy and Safety of Testosterone Treatment in Men: An Evidence Report for a Clinical Practice Guideline by the American College of Physicians.,"Testosterone treatment rates in adult men have increased in the United States over the past 2 decades.
To assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.
English-language searches of multiple electronic databases (January 1980 to May 2019) and reference lists from systematic reviews.
38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 6 months' duration that evaluated transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment and reported prespecified patient-centered outcomes, as well as 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels that reported harms information.
Data extraction by a single investigator was confirmed by a second, 2 investigators assessed risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.
Studies enrolled mostly older men who varied in age, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. Testosterone therapy improved sexual functioning and quality of life in men with low testosterone levels, although effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Testosterone therapy had little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk for these conditions. Observational studies were limited by confounding by indication and contraindication.
Few trials exceeded a 1-year duration, minimum important outcome differences were often not established or reported, RCTs were not powered to assess important harms, few data were available in men aged 18 to 50 years, definitions of low testosterone varied, and study entry criteria varied.
In older men with low testosterone levels without well-established medical conditions known to cause hypogonadism, testosterone therapy may provide small improvements in sexual functioning and quality of life but little to no benefit for other common symptoms of aging. Long-term efficacy and safety are unknown.

259,31899008,Sex difference or hormonal difference in mental rotation? The influence of ovarian milieu.,"Sex differences in visuospatial cognition have long been reported, with men being advantaged on the Mental Rotations Test (MRT). The data, however, are variable, and sensitive to design parameters. When men and women are compared directly, with women in different hormonal milieus combined, there seem to be sex differences. When women alone are studied, taking into account different ovarian steroid concentrations and treatments, MRT performance varies with these changes. Indeed, several reports describe better performance among women with reduced estrogens. To better understand whether the sex difference in MRT persists once hormonal status is considered, we recruited reproductive age adults designated male and female at birth (MAB, FAB), and administered the Vandenberg-Kuse (V/K) MRT-comparing performance among MAB (n = 169) and FAB (n = 219). For FAB combined, we found a sex difference with MAB performing better than FAB. However, when FAB were analyzed by current menstrual cycle phase (Early Follicular (EF), Periovulatory (PO), Midluteal (ML)) or by hormone therapy (transmasculine testosterone administration (TM+), oral contraceptive (OC) ingestion prior to (OC+) or after cognitive testing (OC-)), low-estradiol groups (EF, OC-, TM+) performed as strongly as MAB, and had better MRT than cycling FAB in high-estradiol menstrual cycle phases (PO, ML). On a verbal memory control task, neither a sex difference nor a low estrogen advantage was detected, although performance varied with hormonal milieu. Our findings support a dynamic model of spatial performance and suggest that both MAB and FAB perform strongly on MRT, contingent on hormonal status.","['Cross-sex hormone therapy', 'Estradiol', 'Menstrual cycle', 'Mental rotation', 'Oral contraceptives', 'Sex differences']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Peragine', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Toronto M5S 3G3, CA.

262,31785282,Lower digit ratio and higher endogenous testosterone are associated with lower empathic accuracy.,"Empathy is a cornerstone of human sociality. It has important consequences for our interpersonal relationships and for navigating our social world more generally. Although research has identified numerous psychological factors that can influence empathy, evidence suggests that empathy may also be rooted in our biology and, in particular, the gonadal steroid hormone testosterone. To date, much of the research linking testosterone and empathy has focused on the 2D:4D ratio (i.e., the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers), and the results have been mixed. These mixed results, however, may be due to reliance on self-report measures to assess empathy, which can be vulnerable to self-presentation, as well as social-cultural norms about gender/sex differences in empathy. Moreover, although some have argued that digit ratio is an indicator of prenatal androgen exposure, the evidence for this to date is weak. Here, we aimed to follow up on this prior work, using a naturalistic empathic accuracy task in which participants dynamically track, in real-time, the emotional state of targets. We show that lower digit ratio (Study 1; N = 107) and higher circulating testosterone (Study 2; N = 76) are associated with poorer empathic accuracy performance; critically, these effects hold when controlling for sex/gender. In neither study, however, did we find effects on self-reported empathy. Our results highlight the limitations of self-report measures and support the notion that endogenous testosterone levels as well as 2D:4D ratio are related to key social-cognitive competencies like empathic accuracy.","['Digit ratio', 'Empathic accuracy', 'Person perception', 'Social cognition', 'Testosterone']",Hormones and behavior,2019-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Nitschke', 'firstname': 'Jonas P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, Canada.

263,31715010,Efficacy and safety of prenatal dexamethasone treatment in offspring at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To assess the efficacy and safety of prenatal dexamethasone treatment in offspring at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the clinicaltrials.gov website databases were systematically searched from inception through March 2019. WMD and SMD with 95%CIs were calculated using random or fixed effects models.
There was a significant reduction in virilization in the DEX-treated group (WMD: -2.39, 95%CI: -3.31,-1.47). No significant differences were found in newborn physical outcomes for birth weight (WMD: 0.09, 95%CI: -0.09, 0.27) and birth length (WMD = 0.27, 95%CI: -0.68, 1.21). Concerning cognitive functions, no significant differences in the domains of psychometric intelligence (SMD: 0.05, 95%CI: -0.74, 0.83), verbal memory (SMD: -0.17, 95%CI: -0.58, 0.23), visual memory (SMD: 0.10, 95%CI: -0.14, 0.34), learning (SMD: -0.02, 95%CI: -0.27, 0.22) and verbal processing (SMD: -0.38, 95%CI: -0.93, 0.17). Regarding behavioural problems, no significant differences in the domains of internalizing problems (SMD: 0.16, 95%CI: -0.49, 0.81), externalizing problems (SMD: 0.07, 95%CI: -0.30, 0.43) and total problems (SMD: 0.14, 95%CI: -0.23, 0.51). With respect to temperament, no significant differences in the domains of emotionality (SMD: 0.13, 95%CI: -0.79, 1.05), activity (SMD: 0.04, 95%CI: -0.32, 0.39), shyness (SMD: 0.25, 95%CI: -0.70, 1.20) and sociability (SMD: -0.23, 95%CI: -0.90, 0.44).
Prenatal DEX treatment reduced virilization with no significant differences in newborn physical outcomes, cognitive functions, behavioural problems and temperament. The results need to be interpreted cautiously due to the existence of limitations.","['21-hydroxylase deficiency', 'cognition', 'congenital adrenal hyperplasia', 'dexamethasone', 'problem behaviour', 'temperament', 'virilization']",Clinical endocrinology,2019-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Lizhen', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Liangchun', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Huibin', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Jixing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Liantao', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zong', 'firstname': 'Liyao', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Nengying', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wen', 'firstname': 'Junping', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Gang', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, China.\nDepartment of Scientific research, Fujian Academy of Medical Sciences, Fuzhou, China.'}]",,,"There was a significant reduction in virilization in the DEX-treated group (WMD: -2.39, 95%CI: -3.31,-1.47).

31608848","Opposite-sex and same-sex twin studies of physiological, cognitive and behavioral traits.","A scientific interest in opposite-sex (OS) twins comes from animal studies showing hormone transfer between fetuses in utero. A parallel effect in humans may occur, especially for OS females who may be exposed to androgens, in particular testosterone, from the male co-twin. Conversely, OS males may be exposed to lower levels of prenatal testosterone than do same-sex (SS) males. In this special issue, we reviewed published studies investigating potential differences between OS and SS twins in physiological, cognitive and behavioral traits focusing on the Twin Testosterone Transfer (TTT) hypothesis. Sixty articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria including 23 studies published since the review by Tapp et al. (2011). In general, studies of cognition are conflicting, but it is the phenotype for which most support for the TTT hypothesis is found. Less consistent evidence has been found regarding physiological and behavioral traits. We hope that this special issue will stimulate a discussion about how an investigation of the TTT hypothesis should continue in future research.","['Behavior', 'Cognition', 'Masculinization', 'Opposite-sex', 'Physiology', 'Same-sex', 'Sex differences', 'Testosterone', 'Twins']",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Ahrenfeldt', 'firstname': 'Linda Juel', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Biodemography, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, 5000, Odense, Denmark; The Danish Twin Registry, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, 5000, Odense, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Christensen', 'firstname': 'Kaare', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Biodemography, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, 5000, Odense, Denmark; The Danish Twin Registry, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, 5000, Odense, Denmark; Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Odense University Hospital, 5000, Odense, Denmark; Department of Clinical Genetics, Odense University Hospital, 5000 Odense, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Segal', 'firstname': 'Nancy L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, California State University, 800 N.

29732566",Anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse and cognitive impairment: Testosterone IMPAIRS biconditional task performance in male rats.,"Our goal is to understand the consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) abuse on cognitive function, using rats as a model. There is relatively little research on how AAS abuse impacts cognition. In the present study, rats were tested for their ability to use contextual information to guide decision-making in biconditional discrimination. The Stroop task is a classic human test for contextual decision-making. In rodents, biconditional discrimination challenges subjects to use contextual cues in the operant chamber to resolve the correct lever response when auditory and visual cues are incongruent. The hypothesis is that chronic high-dose testosterone impairs biconditional discrimination. Rats were trained in 24 trials/day over 14 days, in alternating sessions with each environment. On a flat floor with houselight illuminated, auditory cues (clicker vs tone) signified the active lever. On a barred floor with no light, visual cues from 2 stimulus lights (constant vs blinking) identified the active lever. Rats treated chronically with testosterone (7.5 mg/kg) were unimpaired in task acquisition, and all rats learned to select the correct lever in response to auditory or visual cues. During extinction, controls made significantly more correct than incorrect responses in congruent trials (p < 0.05 by paired t-test), but testosterone-treated rats failed to show a similar preference. This was reflected by significant interactions of drug x cue agreement (F","['Anabolic agents', 'Biconditional discrimination', 'Discrimination learning', 'Operant behavior', 'Testosterone']",Behavioural brain research,2019-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Wood', 'firstname': 'Ruth I', 'initials': 'RI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Integrative Anatomical Sciences, Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, United States.

31684688",Oxandrolone for growth hormone-treated girls aged up to 18 years with Turner syndrome.,"The final adult height of untreated girls aged up to 18 years with Turner syndrome (TS) is approximately 20 cm shorter compared with healthy females. Treatment with growth hormone (GH) increases the adult height of people with TS. The effects of adding the androgen, oxandrolone, in addition to GH are unclear. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to investigate the benefits and harms of oxandrolone as an adjuvant therapy for people with TS treated with GH.
To assess the effects of oxandrolone on growth hormone-treated girls aged up to 18 years with Turner syndrome.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search was October 2018. We applied no language restrictions.
We included randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that enrolled girls aged up to 18 years with TS who were treated with GH and oxandrolone compared with GH only treatment.
Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus, or by consultation with a fourth review author. We assessed trials for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument.
We included six trials with 498 participants with TS, 267 participants were randomised to oxandrolone plus GH treatment and 231 participants were randomised to GH only treatment. The individual trial sample size ranged between 22 and 133 participants. The included trials were conducted in 65 different paediatric endocrinology healthcare facilities including clinics, centres, hospitals and academia in the USA and Europe. The duration of interventions ranged between 3 and 7.6 years. The mean age of participants at start of therapy ranged from 9 to 12 years. Overall, we judged only one trial at low risk of bias in all domains and another trial at high risk of bias in most domains. We downgraded the level of evidence mainly because of imprecision (low number of trials, low number of participants or both). Comparing oxandrolone plus GH with GH only for final adult height showed a mean difference (MD) of 2.7 cm in favour of oxandrolone plus GH treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 4.1; P < 0.001; 5 trials, 270 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.3 cm and 5.1 cm. For adverse events, we based our main analysis on reliable date from two trials with overall low risk of bias. There was no evidence of a difference between oxandrolone plus GH and GH for adverse events (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.96; P = 0.14; 2 trials, 170 participants; low-quality evidence). Six out of 86 (18.6%) participants receiving oxandrolone plus GH compared with 8/84 (9.5%) participants receiving GH only reported adverse events, mainly signs of virilisation (e.g. deepening of the voice). One trial each investigated the effects of treatments on speech (voice frequency; 88 participants), cognition (51 participants) and psychological status (106 participants). The overall results for these comparisons were inconclusive (very low-quality evidence). No trial reported on health-related quality of life or all-cause mortality.
Addition of oxandrolone to the GH therapy led to a modest increase in the final adult height of girls aged up to 18 years with TS. Adverse effects identified included virilising effects such as deepening of the voice, but reporting was inadequate in some trials.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019-11-07,"[{'lastname': 'Mohamed', 'firstname': 'Sarar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Prince Sultant Military Medical City, Genetics and Metabolic Medicine Division, Department of Pediatrics, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nAlfaisal University, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alkofide', 'firstname': 'Hadeel', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy King Saud University KSA, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Adi', 'firstname': 'Yaser A', 'initials': 'YA', 'affiliation': 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Academic & Training Affairs, Riyadh, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 11211 Riyadh.'}, {'lastname': 'Amer', 'firstname': 'Yasser Sami', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'King Saud University College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, Research Chair for Evidence Based Health Care and Knowledge Translation, CPG Steering Committee, Quality Management Department, P.O.Box 71470 Al Diriyah, Riyadh, Ar-Riyad (Riyadh), Saudi Arabia, 11587.'}, {'lastname': 'AlFaleh', 'firstname': 'Khalid', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'King Saud University, Department of Pediatrics (Division of Neonatology), King Khalid University Hospital and College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics (39), P.O.

12000125",The Implication of Androgens in the Presence of Protein Kinase C to Repair Alzheimer’s Disease-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction.,"Aging, as a major risk factor of memory deficiency, affects neural signaling pathways in hippocampus. In particular, age-dependent androgens deficiency causes cognitive impairments. Several enzymes like protein kinase C (PKC) are involved in memory deficiency. Indeed, PKC regulatory process mediates α-secretase activation to cleave APP in β-amyloid cascade and tau proteins phosphorylation mechanism. Androgens and cortisol regulate PKC signaling pathways, affecting the modulation of receptor for activated C kinase 1. Mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK signaling pathway depends on CREB activity in hippocampal neurons and is involved in regulatory processes via PKC and androgens. Therefore, testosterone and PKC contribute in the neuronal apoptosis. The present review summarizes the current status of androgens, PKC, and their influence on cognitive learning. Inconsistencies in experimental investigations related to this fundamental correlation are also discussed, with emphasis on the mentioned contributors as the probable potent candidates for learning and memory improvement.","['Androgens', 'Cognition', 'Hippocampus', 'Protein kinase C', 'Spatial memory']",Iranian biomedical journal,2019-11-05,"[{'lastname': 'Amiri', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Azadmanesh', 'firstname': 'Kayhan', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Virology, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Dehghan Shasaltaneh', 'firstname': 'Marzieh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mayahi', 'firstname': 'Vafa', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Naghdi', 'firstname': 'Nasser', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.'}]",,,,,10.29252/ibj.24.2.64,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de9673b0>,,,,,,
268,31671430,Chronic Testosterone Deprivation Sensitizes the Middle-Aged Rat Brain to Damaging Effects of Testosterone Replacement.,"An increasing number of middle-aged men are being screened for low testosterone levels and the number of prescriptions for various forms of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has increased dramatically over the last 10 years. However, the safety of TRT has come into question with some studies suggesting increased morbidity and mortality.
Because the benefits of estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women and ovariectomized rodents are lost if there is an extended delay between estrogen loss and replacement, we hypothesized that TRT may also be sensitive to delayed replacement.
We compared the effects of testosterone replacement after short-term (2 weeks) and long-term testosterone deprivation (LTTD; 10 weeks) in middle-aged male rats on cerebral ischemia, oxidative stress, and cognitive function. We hypothesized that LTTD would increase oxidative stress levels and abrogate the beneficial effects of TRT.
Hypogonadism itself and TRT after short-term castration did not affect stroke outcome compared to intact rats. However, after long-term hypogonadism in middle-aged male Fischer 344 rats, TRT exacerbated the detrimental behavioral effects of experimental focal cerebral ischemia, whereas this detrimental effect was prevented by administration of the free-radical scavenger tempol, suggesting that TRT exacerbates oxidative stress. In contrast, TRT improved cognitive performance in non-stroked rats regardless of the length of hypogonadism. In the Morris water maze, peripheral oxidative stress was highly associated with decreased cognitive ability.
Taken together, these data suggest that TRT after long-term hypogonadism can exacerbate functional recovery after focal cerebral ischemia, but in the absence of injury can enhance cognition. Both of these effects are modulated by oxidative stress levels.","['Aging', 'Cognition', 'Hormone replacement', 'Stroke']",Neuroendocrinology,2019-11-02,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Charity', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Contreras-Garza', 'firstname': 'Jo', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cunningham', 'firstname': 'Rebecca L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nDepartment of Physiology and Anatomy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Jessica M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vann', 'firstname': 'Philip H', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Metzger', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kasanga', 'firstname': 'Ella', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Oppong-Gyebi', 'firstname': 'Anthony', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sumien', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schreihofer', 'firstname': 'Derek A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA, derek.schreihofer@unthsc.edu.\nInstitute for Healthy Aging, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, USA, derek.schreihofer@unthsc.edu.'}]",,,"Hypogonadism itself and TRT after short-term castration did not affect stroke outcome compared to intact rats.

269,31646934,Predicting infant-father attachment: the role of pre- and postnatal triadic family alliance and paternal testosterone levels.,"This longitudinal study examined whether prenatal family alliance and prenatal paternal testosterone levels predicted infant-mother and infant-father attachment security and whether this association was mediated by postnatal family alliance and postnatal paternal testosterone levels. In 105 couples expecting their first child, family alliance was assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy with the prenatal version of the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP). Family alliance was measured again 6 months postnatally, using the LTP. Fathers provided testosterone samples prenatally and at 6 months postnatally. Infant-parent attachment was assessed with the Attachment Q-Sort (AQS) at 24 months. Results indicated an increase in paternal testosterone levels from the pre- to the postnatal period. A more positive prenatal family alliance predicted higher infant-father attachment security at 24 months, but not infant-mother attachment security. The association between prenatal family alliance and attachment security was not mediated by postnatal family alliance or postnatal paternal testosterone levels. This study highlights the significance of prenatal family relations, and the need to consider in research and practice the divergent effects of prenatal family alliance patterns on the emerging infant-mother and infant-father attachment relationships. The underlying hormonal mechanisms during the transition to fatherhood are important targets for future research.","['Infant–father attachment', 'Lausanne Trilogue Play', 'prenatal family relations', 'testosterone', 'triadic family interactions']",Attachment & human development,2019-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Witte', 'firstname': 'Annemieke M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit , Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakermans-Kranenburg', 'firstname': 'Marian J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit , Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nLeiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden University Medical Center , Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van IJzendoorn', 'firstname': 'Marinus H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam , Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Szepsenwol', 'firstname': 'Ohad', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Education, Max Stern Yezreel Valley College , Yezreel Valley, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Shai', 'firstname': 'Dana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'SEED Center, School of Behavior Sciences, Academic College Tel Aviv-Yaffo , Tel Aviv-Yaffo, Israel.'}]",,,,,10.1080/14616734.2019.1680713,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de6cbcc0>,,,,,,

15848798",Neurobiological mechanisms underlying sex-related differences in stress-related disorders: Effects of neuroactive steroids on the hippocampus.,"Men and women differ in their vulnerability to a variety of stress-related illnesses, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood. This is likely due to a comparative dearth of neurobiological studies that assess male and female rodents at the same time, while human neuroimaging studies often don't model sex as a variable of interest. These sex differences are often attributed to the actions of sex hormones, i.e. estrogens, progestogens and androgens. In this review, we summarize the results on sex hormone actions in the hippocampus and seek to bridge the gap between animal models and findings in humans. However, while effects of sex hormones on the hippocampus are largely consistent in animals and humans, methodological differences challenge the comparability of animal and human studies on stress effects. We summarise our current understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie sex-related differences in behavior and discuss implications for stress-related illnesses.","['Cognition', 'Sex differences', 'Stress', 'Translational']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2019-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Hillerer', 'firstname': 'Katharina M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Salzburger Landeskrankenhaus (SALK), Paracelsus Medical University (PMU), Clinical Research Center Salzburg (CRCS), Salzburg, Austria.

272,31557486,Hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in male depressive disorders - A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Sexual dysfunctions are common in men with depression. As the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is a crucial regulator of sexual function, and also affects mood and cognition, the following question arises: Is the HPG axis altered in depressed men when compared to healthy controls? To answer this question, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched. Inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis were: (1) case-control study including male patients with a depressive disorder and (2) assessment of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), oestradiol, or testosterone. Seventeen studies were identified. Follicle-stimulating hormone and LH did not differ between patients and controls. By contrast, in patients, oestradiol was marginally increased (g = 0.52, 95% CI [-0.01, 1.04]; Z = 1.92, p = .055) and testosterone was significantly decreased (g = -0.45, 95% CI [-0.80, -0.10]; Z = -2.53, p = .012). Depressed men may be characterised by diminished testosterone and potentially elevated oestradiol, which beyond contributing to sexual dysfunction, could impact mood and cognition.","['Depression', 'Follicle-stimulating hormone', 'Luteinising hormone', 'Male', 'Oestradiol', 'Testosterone']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2019-09-27,"[{'lastname': 'Fischer', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich, Institute of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Switzerland.

273,31541914,Challenging the challenge hypothesis on testosterone in fathers: Limited meta-analytic support.,"In fathers testosterone levels are suggested to decrease in the context of caregiving, but results seem inconsistent. In a meta-analysis including 50 study outcomes with N = 7,080 male participants we distinguished three domains of research, relating testosterone levels to parental status (Hedges' g = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.35; N = 4,150), parenting quality (Hedges' g = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.24; N = 2,164), and reactivity after exposure to child stimuli (Hedges' g = 0.19, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.42; N = 766). The sets of study outcomes on reactivity and on parenting quality were both homogeneous. Parental status and (higher) parenting quality were related to lower levels of testosterone, but according to conventional criteria combined effect sizes were small. Moderators did not significantly modify combined effect sizes. Results suggest that publication bias might have inflated the meta-analytic results, and the large effects of pioneering but small and underpowered studies in the domains of males' parental status and parenting quality have not been consistently replicated. Large studies with sufficient statistical power to detect small testosterone effects and, in particular, the moderating effects of the interplay with other endocrine systems and with contextual determinants are required.","['Challenge hypothesis', 'Fathers', 'Hormones', 'Parental status', 'Parenting', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Meijer', 'firstname': 'Willemijn M', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van IJzendoorn', 'firstname': 'Marinus H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakermans-Kranenburg', 'firstname': 'Marian J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Child & Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.

26789855",Health considerations for transgender women and remaining unknowns: a narrative review.,"Transgender (trans) women (TW) were assigned male at birth but have a female gender identity or gender expression. The literature on management and health outcomes of TW has grown recently with more publication of research. This has coincided with increasing awareness of gender diversity as communities around the world identify and address health disparities among trans people. In this narrative review, we aim to comprehensively summarize health considerations for TW and identify TW-related research areas that will provide answers to remaining unknowns surrounding TW's health. We cover up-to-date information on: (1) feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT); (2) benefits associated with GAHT, particularly quality of life, mental health, breast development and bone health; (3) potential risks associated with GAHT, including cardiovascular disease and infertility; and (4) other health considerations like HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, other tumours, voice therapy, dermatology, the brain and cognition, and aging. Although equally deserving of mention, feminizing gender-affirming surgery, paediatric and adolescent populations, and gender nonbinary individuals are beyond the scope of this review. While much of the data we discuss come from Europe, the creation of a United States transgender cohort has already contributed important retrospective data that are also summarized here. Much remains to be determined regarding health considerations for TW. Patients and providers will benefit from larger and longer prospective studies involving TW, particularly regarding the effects of aging, race and ethnicity, type of hormonal treatment (e.g. different oestrogens, anti-androgens) and routes of administration (e.g. oral, parenteral, transdermal) on all the topics we address.","['anti-androgen', 'gender-affirming hormone therapy', 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist', 'oestradiol', 'safety', 'transgender women']",Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism,2019-09-14,"[{'lastname': 'Iwamoto', 'firstname': 'Sean J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, 12801 East 17th Avenue, Mail Stop: 8106, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Defreyne', 'firstname': 'Justine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Rothman', 'firstname': 'Micol S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Schuylenbergh', 'firstname': 'Judith', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Sexology and Gender, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van de Bruaene', 'firstname': 'Laurens', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Motmans', 'firstname': 'Joz', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Sexology and Gender, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': ""T'Sjoen"", 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}]",,,,,"10.1177/2042018819871166

275,31509765,Do oral contraceptives modulate an ERP response to affective pictures?,"Indications exist that use of oral contraceptives affects women's socio-emotional behaviour, brain function and, cognitive abilities, but the information is still scarce and ambiguous. We aimed to examine affective processing of visual stimuli between oral contraceptive users (OC, n = 33) and naturally cycling women (NC, n = 37) using the event-related potential (ERP) method. The main findings are: (i) emotionally arousing stimuli elicited significantly enlarged late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli, (ii) anti-androgenic OC users demonstrated diminished brain reactivity to visual stimuli, and (iii) significantly blunted reaction to highly unpleasant images. In addition, a positive relationship between GFP evoked by the highly unpleasant and highly pleasant visual emotional stimuli and progesterone was observed in NC women, while OC users demonstrated a trend of negative relationship between GFP and progesterone level. These findings suggest possible modulations of affective processing of visual stimuli when hormonal contraceptives are used.","['Affective processing', 'Emotional visual stimuli', 'Late positive potential', 'Oral contraceptives', 'Sex steroids']",Biological psychology,2019-09-12,"[{'lastname': 'Monciunskaite', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biosciences, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.

276,31499080,Nandrolone improve synaptic plasticity at the hippocampus CA1 area and spatial localization in the Morris water maze of male adolescent rats.,"Nandrolone is the most popular compound that are mainly abused. Experimental studies have reported that administration of nandrolone affects cognitive performance. So, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nandrolone on spatial localization and synaptic plasticity of male adolescent rats. Experimantal groups received DMSO and nandrolone (10, 30 and 60 μg, i.c.v.). Another aim is to evaluate the role of castration on spatial learning and memory changes induced by nandrolone. Therefore, the rats of fifth and sixth groups were castrated and received DMSO or nandrolone. Analysis showed that escape latency and traveled distance in the group which received nandrolone (60 μg) were significantly lower than control group. Also, the escape latency and traveled distance in the group of castration which received nandrolone was significantly higher than nandrolone treated group. The results of field potential recording showed that fEPSP-LTP in nandrolone-treated group was higher than DMSO-treated group. The magnitude of fEPSP-LTP in the group of castration which received nandrolone was significantly lower than nandrolone-treated group. The results demonstrated that nandrolone improved spatial learning, but castration could abolished nandrolone-induced spatial learning improvement. These results indicating that at least some effect of nandrolone on learning induced through changes in gonadal function.","['Adolescence', 'Hippocampus', 'Nandrolone', 'PS-LTP', 'Spatial memory', 'fEPSP-LTP']",Neuroscience research,2019-09-10,"[{'lastname': 'Salimi', 'firstname': 'Zahra', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Khajehpour', 'firstname': 'Lotfollah', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Moradpour', 'firstname': 'Farshad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Fertility & Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; Department of Physiology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; Department of Biology, Centre for Biomedical Research, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.

31480979",Does testosterone impair men's cognitive empathy? Evidence from two large-scale randomized controlled trials.,"The capacity to infer others' mental states (known as 'mind reading' and 'cognitive empathy') is essential for social interactions across species, and its impairment characterizes psychopathological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Previous studies reported that testosterone administration impaired cognitive empathy in healthy humans, and that a putative biomarker of prenatal testosterone exposure (finger digit ratios) moderated the effect. However, empirical support for the relationship has relied on small sample studies with mixed evidence. We investigate the reliability and generalizability of the relationship in two large-scale double-blind placebo-controlled experiments in young men (n = 243 and n = 400), using two different testosterone administration protocols. We find no evidence that cognitive empathy is impaired by testosterone administration or associated with digit ratios. With an unprecedented combined sample size, these results counter current theories and previous high-profile reports, and demonstrate that previous investigations of this topic have been statistically underpowered.","['cognitive empathy', 'mind reading', 'pharmacology', 'prenatal priming', 'steroid hormones', 'testosterone']",Proceedings.

278,31465941,In vivo magnetic resonance imaging reveals the effect of gonadal hormones on morphological and functional brain sexual dimorphisms in adult sheep.,"Sex differences in the brain and behavior are produced by the perinatal action of testosterone, which is converted into estradiol by the enzyme aromatase in the brain. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used in humans to study these differences, the use of animal models, where hormonal status can be properly manipulated, is necessary to explore the mechanisms involved. We used sheep, a recognized model in the field of neuroendocrinology, to assess brain morphological and functional sex differences and their regulation by adult gonadal hormones. To this end, we performed voxel-based morphometry and a resting-state functional MRI approach to assess sex differences in gonadally intact animals. We demonstrated significant sex differences in gray matter concentration (GMC) at the level of the gonadotropic axis, i.e., not only within the hypothalamus and pituitary but also within the hippocampus and the amygdala of intact animals. We then performed the same analysis one month after gonadectomy and found that some of these differences were reduced, especially in the hypothalamus and amygdala. By contrast, we found few differences in the organization of the functional connectome between males and females either before or after gonadectomy. As a whole, our study identifies brain regions that are sexually dimorphic in the sheep brain at the resolution of the MRI and highlights the role of gonadal hormones in the maintenance of these differences.","['Gonadectomy', 'Resting state fMRI', 'Sex differences', 'Sheep', 'Voxel-based morphometry']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019-08-30,"[{'lastname': 'Barrière', 'firstname': 'David André', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'UMR Physiologie de la Reproduction et des Comportements, INRA/CNRS/Université de Tours/IFCE, Nouzilly, France; Neurospin, CEA, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ella', 'firstname': 'Arsène', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'UMR Physiologie de la Reproduction et des Comportements, INRA/CNRS/Université de Tours/IFCE, Nouzilly, France; MRC Cognition & Brain Science Unit, University of Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Adriaensen', 'firstname': 'Hans', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'UMR Physiologie de la Reproduction et des Comportements, INRA/CNRS/Université de Tours/IFCE, Nouzilly, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Roselli', 'firstname': 'Charles E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chemineau', 'firstname': 'Philippe', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'UMR Physiologie de la Reproduction et des Comportements, INRA/CNRS/Université de Tours/IFCE, Nouzilly, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Keller', 'firstname': 'Matthieu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'UMR Physiologie de la Reproduction et des Comportements, INRA/CNRS/Université de Tours/IFCE, Nouzilly, France.

279,31446215,Evidence for enhanced androgen action in the prefrontal cortex of people with bipolar disorder but not schizophrenia or major depressive disorder.,"Anxiety and depressive disorders are more prevalent in hypogonadal men. Low testosterone levels are associated with greater negative symptoms and impaired cognition in men with schizophrenia. Thus, androgens may contribute to brain pathophysiology in psychiatric disorders. We investigated androgen-related mRNAs in post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of psychiatric disorders. We also assessed androgen receptor (AR) CAG trinucleotide repeat length, a functional AR gene variant associated with AR gene expression, receptor activity, and circulating testosterone. AR CAG repeat length was determined from genomic DNA and AR and 5α-reductase mRNAs measured using quantitative PCR in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control cases [n = 35/group; Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) Array collection]. Layer-specific AR gene expression was determined using in situ hybridisation in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and control cases (n = 15/group; SMRI Neuropathology Consortium). AR mRNA was increased in bipolar disorder, but was unchanged in schizophrenia, relative to controls. AR and 5α-reductase mRNAs were significantly positively correlated in bipolar disorder. AR CAG repeat length was significantly shorter in bipolar disorder relative to schizophrenia. AR mRNA expression was highest in cortical layers IV and V, but no layer-specific diagnostic differences were detected. Together, our results suggest enhanced cortical androgen action in people with bipolar disorder.","['5α-reductase', 'Androgen receptor', 'CAG', 'Gene expression', 'Polyglutamine', 'Post-mortem', 'Sex steroid hormones', 'Testosterone']",Psychiatry research,2019-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Owens', 'firstname': 'Samantha J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Schizophrenia Research Laboratory, Neuroscience Research Australia, Randwick NSW 2031, Australia; School of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney NSW 2052, Australia.

24530839","A Z-score based method for comparing the relative sensitivity of behavioral and physiological metrics including cognitive performance, mood, and hormone levels.","A method for assessing the relative sensitivity of research metrics is proposed and illustrated by comparing 18 outcome measures from a published study of the cognitive, mood, and hormonal effects of four different levels of stress induced by intense military training. Research on the human response to stress often assesses multiple disparate dependent measures. Selecting the most sensitive is difficult as formal methods to compare varied dependent measures have not been developed. The method first converts the outcome measures into standard scores (z-scores) and then compares them using analysis of variance to determine whether there are differences in how they assess the impact of graded levels of exposure to stress. The analysis detected various significant interactions in several measures and suggests self-report mood questionnaires were more sensitive to the stressors present in the study than the cognitive or hormonal measures which were used. These findings support the effectiveness of the z-score based method as a useful procedure for objectively evaluating the differential sensitivity of various metrics. This method could be useful for research on other independent variables when use of multiple assessment strategies is appropriate. It could be used for evaluating studies yielding conflicting results, such as those detecting effects on one parameter but not others. In such instances, cross-metric inconsistencies may be due to differential sensitivity of measurement strategies rather than actual differences in the effects of the independent-variable on the domains under investigation.",[],PloS one,2019-08-16,"[{'lastname': 'Caldwell', 'firstname': 'John A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Belcamp, MD, United States of America.\nMilitary Nutrition Division, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Niro', 'firstname': 'Philip J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Military Nutrition Division, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Farina', 'firstname': 'Emily K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Military Nutrition Division, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA, United States of America.\nHenry M.

281,31401625,Associations of IGF-1 and Adrenal Androgens with Cognition in Childhood.,"Little is known about the association between adrenarche and cognition in general populations of children. We therefore studied the associations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (A4), testosterone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and adrenarche with cognition among prepubertal children.
These cross-sectional analyses are based on baseline data of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children Study. A total of 387 children (183 girls, 204 boys) were included in the analyses. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) score was used to assess nonverbal reasoning. Serum adrenal androgens and IGF-1 concentrations were measured and clinical signs of androgen action were evaluated.
Higher IGF-1 among boys (β = 0.149, p =0.033) was related to a better Raven's CPM score after adjustment for age and parental education. Adrenal androgens in girls or boys or IGF-1 in girls were not associated with the score.

282,31353194,Safety and efficacy of testosterone for women: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trial data.,"The benefits and risks of testosterone treatment for women with diminished sexual wellbeing remain controversial. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess potential benefits and risks of testosterone for women.
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for blinded, randomised controlled trials of testosterone treatment of at least 12 weeks' duration completed between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 10, 2018. We also searched drug registration applications to the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration to identify any unpublished data. Primary outcomes were the effects of testosterone on sexual function, cardiometabolic variables, cognitive measures, and musculoskeletal health. This study is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42018104073.
Our search strategy retrieved 46 reports of 36 randomised controlled trials comprising 8480 participants. Our meta-analysis showed that, compared with placebo or a comparator (eg, oestrogen, with or without progestogen), testosterone significantly increased sexual function, including satisfactory sexual event frequency (mean difference 0·85, 95% CI 0·52 to 1·18), sexual desire (standardised mean difference 0·36, 95% CI 0·22 to 0·50), pleasure (mean difference 6·86, 95% CI 5·19 to 8·52), arousal (standardised mean difference 0·28, 95% CI 0·21 to 0·35), orgasm (standardised mean difference 0·25, 95% CI 0·18 to 0·32), responsiveness (standardised mean difference 0·28, 95% CI 0·21 to 0·35), and self-image (mean difference 5·64, 95% CI 4·03 to 7·26), and reduced sexual concerns (mean difference 8·99, 95% CI 6·90 to 11·08) and distress (standardised mean difference -0·27, 95% CI -0·36 to -0·17) in postmenopausal women. A significant rise in the amount of LDL-cholesterol, and reductions in the amounts of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, were seen with testosterone administered orally, but not when administered non-orally (eg, by transdermal patch or cream). An overall increase in weight was recorded with testosterone treatment. No effects of testosterone were reported for body composition, musculoskeletal variables, or cognitive measures, although the number of women who contributed data for these outcomes was small. Testosterone was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting acne and hair growth, but no serious adverse events were recorded.
Testosterone is effective for postmenopausal women with low sexual desire causing distress, with administration via non-oral routes (eg, transdermal application) preferred because of a neutral lipid profile. The effects of testosterone on individual wellbeing and musculoskeletal and cognitive health, as well as long-term safety, warrant further investigation.

9876028",Mitigation of Muscle Loss in Stressed Physiology: Military Relevance.,"Military personnel may be exposed to circumstances (e.g., large energy deficits, sleep deprivation, cognitive demands, and environmental extremes) of external stressors during training and combat operations (i.e., operational stressors) that combine to degrade muscle protein. The loss of muscle protein is further exacerbated by frequent periods of severe energy deficit. Exposure to these factors results in a hypogonadal state that may contribute to observed decrements in muscle mass. In this review, lessons learned from studying severe clinical stressed states and the interventions designed to mitigate the loss of muscle protein are discussed in the context of military operational stress. For example, restoration of the anabolic hormonal status (e.g., testosterone, insulin, and growth hormone) in stressed physiological states may be necessary to restore the anabolic influence derived from dietary protein on muscle. Based on our clinical experiences, restoration of the normal testosterone status during sustained periods of operational stress may be advantageous. We demonstrated that in severe burn patients, pharmacologic normalization of the anabolic hormonal status restores the anabolic stimulatory effect of nutrition on muscle by improving the protein synthetic efficiency and limiting amino acid loss from skeletal muscle. Furthermore, an optimal protein intake, and in particular essential amino acid delivery, may be an integral ingredient in a restored anabolic response during the stress state. Interventions which improve the muscle net protein balance may positively impact soldier performance in trying conditions.","['amino acids', 'androgens', 'military', 'protein metabolism', 'skeletal muscle', 'testosterone']",Nutrients,2019-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Church', 'firstname': 'David D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Donald W.

284,31296441,Effects of Testosterone Supplementation on Separate Cognitive Domains in Cognitively Healthy Older Men: A Meta-analysis of Current Randomized Clinical Trials.,"An increasing body of literature suggests a positive, neuroprotective effect for testosterone on cognition in older men. However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the effects of testosterone supplementation (TS) on cognitive function have been inconclusive.
To investigate the potential for TS to prevent cognitive decline in otherwise cognitively healthy older men, by examining the differential effects of TS on cognitively healthy older men in RCTs.
Comprehensive search of electronic databases, conference proceedings, and grey literature from 1990 to 2018 was performed to identify RCTs examining the effects of TS on cognition before and after supplementation, in cognitively healthy individuals.
A final sample of 14 eligible RCTs met inclusion criteria. Using pooled random effects expressed as Hedge's g, comparison of placebo versus treatment groups pre- and postsupplementation showed improvements in the treatment group in executive function (g (11) = 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.26, z = 0.56, p = 0.011). However, it was noted that two studies in our sample did not report a significant increase in mean serum total testosterone (TT) levels in the treatment group after supplementation. Following exclusion of these studies, analysis indicated improvement in the treatment group for the overall cognitive composite (g (11) = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.02-0.33, z = 2.18), psychomotor speed (g (3) = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.01-0.43, z = 2.07) and executive function (g (9) = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03-0.28, z = 2.35). No significant differences were noted for the global cognition, attention, verbal memory, visuospatial ability or visuospatial memory domains.
Overall, our findings support the potential for TS as a preventative measure against cognitive decline, although the effect sizes were small. These findings warrant further observational studies and clinical trials of good methodological quality, to elucidate the effect of TS on cognition.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Testosterone supplementation', 'ageing', 'cognitive decline', 'cognitive function', 'hypogonadism', 'memory']",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,2019-07-13,"[{'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Sherilyn', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Australian Alzheimer's Research Foundation, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia; School of Psychological Science, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Sohrabi', 'firstname': 'Hamid R', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': ""Australian Alzheimer's Research Foundation, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia; School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Western Australia, Australia; School of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

285,31272353,Classical Steroids in a New Fashion: Focus on Testosterone and Aldosterone.,"Several endocrine glands produce steroid hormones. Thanks to the work of chemists and biochemists, the main synthetic as well as metabolic pathways of steroid hormones were included in the textbooks more than 50 years ago and the classical endocrine gland functions were identified. Later on, evidence of steroid hormone effects beyond the classical endocrine gland function has been accumulating. Testosterone was shown to participate in the stress response and may influence coping with stressors. We have shown a decrease in testosterone concentrations in saliva in children undergoing a school exam compared to values on a non-exam school day. Testosterone has been associated with different cognitive functions in both adults and children. Circulating testosterone has been linked to negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Aldosterone is acting via mineralocorticoid receptors, which are thought to be fully occupied by glucocorticoids in the brain. Until now, an action of aldosterone in the brain has not been considered at all, because the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which would enable aldosterone to bind to receptors is absent in most of the brain areas. We have brought evidence that aldosterone can act in the brain and produce anxiogenic and depressogenic effects. To facilitate the translation of animal findings into clinical research, we have developed methodology for measurement of salivary aldosterone and obtained first data on a relationship between salivary aldosterone and trait anxiety. We have shown that salivary aldosterone concentrations reflect treatment outcome in patients with major depressive disorder.","['Androgens', 'children', 'cognition', 'mineralocorticoid', 'psychiatric disorders', 'stress.']",Current protein & peptide science,2019-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Jezova', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Pharmacological Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Balagova', 'firstname': 'Lucia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Pharmacological Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chmelova', 'firstname': 'Magdalena', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Pharmacological Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hlavacova', 'firstname': 'Natasa', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Pharmacological Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava, Slovakia.'}]",,,,"Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",10.2174/1389203720666190704151254,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de495b80>,,,,,,

2066776",Age and cognitive status dependent differences in blood steroid and thyroid hormone concentrations in intact male rats.,"Age-dependent alterations of hormonal states have been considered to be involved in age related decline of cognitive abilities. Most of the studies in animal models are based on hormonal substitution in adrenal- and/or gonadectomized rodents or infusion of steroid hormones in intact rats. Moreover, the manipulations have been done timely, closely related to test procedures, thus reflecting short-term hormonal mechanisms in the regulation of learning and memory. Here we studied whether more general states of steroid and thyroid hormone profiles, independent from acute experiences, may possibly reflect long-term learning capacity. A large cohort of aged (17-18 months) intact male rats were tested in a spatial hole-board learning task and a subset of inferior and superior learners was included into the analysis. Young male adult rats (16 weeks of age) were also tested. Four to 8 weeks after testing blood plasma samples were taken and hormone concentrations of a variety of steroid hormones were measured by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or radioimmunoassay (17β-estradiol, thyroid hormones).
Aged good learners were similar to young rats in the behavioral task. Aged poor learners but not good learners showed higher levels of triiodothyronine (T3) as compared to young rats. Aged good learners had higher levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) than aged poor learning and young rats.

2019261",Peripubertal GnRH and testosterone co-treatment leads to increased familiarity preferences in male sheep.,"Chronic gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment is effective for the medical suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in situations like central precocious puberty and gender dysphoria. However, its administration during the peripubertal period could influence normal brain development and function because GnRH receptors are expressed in brain regions that regulate emotions, cognition, motivation and memory. This study used an ovine model to determine whether chronic peripubertal GnRHa-treatment affected the developmental shift from preference of familiarity to novelty. Experimental groups included Controls and GnRHa-treated rams. To differentiate between effects of altered GnRH signaling and those associated with the loss of sex steroids, a group was also included that received testosterone replacement as well as GnRHa (GnRHa + T). Preference for a novel versus familiar object was assessed during 5-min social isolation at 8, 28 and 46 weeks of age. Approach behavior was measured as interactions with and time spent near the objects, whereas avoidance behavior was measured by time spent in the entrance zone and attempts to escape the arena via the entry point. Emotional reactivity was measured by the number of vocalizations, escape attempts and urinations. As Control and GnRHa-treated rams aged, their approach behaviors showed a shift from preference for familiarity (8 weeks) to novelty (46 weeks). In contrast, relative to the Controls the GnRHa + T rams exhibited more approach behaviors towards both objects, at 28 and 46 weeks of age and preferred familiarity at 46 weeks of age. Vocalisation rate was increased in GnRHa treated rams in late puberty (28 weeks) compared to both Control and GnRHa + T rams but this effect was not seen in young adulthood (46 weeks). These results suggest that the specific suppression of testosterone during a developmental window in late puberty may reduce emotional reactivity and hamper learning a flexible adjustment to environmental change. The results also suggest that disruption of either endogenous testosterone signalling or a synergistic action between GnRH and testosterone signalling, may delay maturation of cognitive processes (e.g. information processing) that affects the motivation of rams to approach and avoid objects.","['Cognition', 'GnRH', 'Motivation', 'Novelty', 'Puberty', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019-06-24,"[{'lastname': 'Hough', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Robinson', 'firstname': 'J E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bellingham', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fleming', 'firstname': 'L M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'McLaughlin', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jama', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Haraldsen', 'firstname': 'Irh', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, Division of Surgery and Clinical Neuroscience, Oslo University Hospital - Rikshospitalet, 0027 Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Solbakk', 'firstname': 'A K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Division of Surgery and Clinical Neuroscience, Oslo University Hospital - Rikshospitalet, 0027 Oslo, Norway; Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Pb 1094 Blindern, 0317 Oslo, Norway; Department of Neuropsychology, Helgeland Hospital, 8607 Mosjøen, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'N P', 'initials': 'NP', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.

Research has shown that there is an increasing number of adolescent AAS abusers. Adolescents are at a critical period of physical and mental development. Sex hormones are one of the important physiological factors affecting the development of their bodies and brains. Long-term or high-dose AAS treatment is likely to cause irreversible damage to their nervous system and psychological behavior, and these effects are easily overlooked.

289,31175935,Sex specific relationships between infants' mental rotation ability and amiotic sex hormones.,"Sex differences in mental rotation, robust in adults, have recently been reported for infants' looking times although the pattern of results is not completely conclusive. In this context, organizational effects of gonadal steroids affecting the neural circuitry underlying spatial cognition could be (partly) responsible for the early sex difference. In the present study testosterone and estradiol levels measured in amniotic fluid via ultra performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry were used to examine the role of prenatal sex hormones on infants' looking times during mental rotation. N = 208 six-month-old infants participated in an expectation of violation task with 3D cube figures. Mental rotation was defined as the difference in looking times for familiar versus mirrored cube figures whereas vigilance was defined as the sum of both looking times. Sex differences were absent for mental rotation as well as for vigilance. Most importantly, however, for boys mental rotation but not vigilance was correlated with prenatal testosterone but not with estradiol. For girls mental rotation but not vigilance was correlated with prenatal estradiol but not with testosterone although it has to be noted that the testosterone values for girls suffered from a floor effect. Only 5% of the within-sex variance was due to prenatal sex hormones indicating small effects. These findings extend our knowledge concerning organizational effects of prenatal sex hormones on the brain circuitry underlying spatial cognition.","['Amniocentesis', 'Infant cognition', 'Mental rotation', 'Prenatal estradiol', 'Prenatal testosterone', 'Sex differences']",Neuroscience letters,2019-06-09,"[{'lastname': 'Erdmann', 'firstname': 'Kathrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schaal', 'firstname': 'Nora K', 'initials': 'NK', 'affiliation': 'Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Meinlschmidt', 'firstname': 'Gunther', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'University Hospital Basel, Switzerland; International Psychoanalytic University Berlin, Germany; University of Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Tegethoff', 'firstname': 'Marion', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Fröhlich', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Prenatal Medicine and Genetics, Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kozlowski', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Prenatal Medicine and Genetics, Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rivet', 'firstname': 'Noëllie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'University of Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Jamey', 'firstname': 'Carole', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Strasbourg, France; Strasbourg Regional University Hospital, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Reix', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Strasbourg Regional University Hospital, France; University of Strasbourg/CNRS, Federation of Translational Medicine, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kintz', 'firstname': 'Pascal', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'University of Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Raul', 'firstname': 'Jean-Sébastien', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'University of Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Heil', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany.

290,31173920,Calcineurin is involved in retrieval of passive avoidance memory and synaptic plasticity impairment induced by Nandrolone administration in adolescent male rats.,"In spite of evidence about negative effects of Nandrolone Decanoate (ND) on cognitive and memory performance, the underlying mechanisms are complex and have remained unclear. This research examines the role of Calcineurin in synaptic plasticity and memory storage impairment in ND administrated adolescent male rats. For behavioral study by passive avoidance learning and memory (PAL), adolescent male rats were treated with ND or ND plus selective Calcineurin antagonist (Tacrolimus), before retention test. ND significantly decreased the retrieval of PAL, whereas Tacrolimus plus ND had no significant effect on PAL. For electrophysiological study hippocampal slices were perfused by ND or ND plus Tacrolimus. The magnitude of fEPSP-LTP of ND perfused slices was less than the control and a reduction of fEPSP-PS (E-S) coupling was observed, while pre-administration of Tacrolimus abolished the ND impairment effect on fEPSP-LTP and E-S coupling. This study showed that ND may induce impairing effects on hippocampal area CA1 activity and plasticity and PAL memory storage through changes in the function of the Calcineurin.","['Adolescence', 'Calcineurin', 'E-S-coupling', 'Nandrolone', 'Synaptic plasticity']",Neurobiology of learning and memory,2019-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Moradpour', 'firstname': 'Farshad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Fertility & Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; Department of Physiology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; Department of Biology, Centre for Biomedical Research, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Moazedi', 'firstname': 'Ahmad Ali', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Pourmotabbed', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Zarei', 'firstname': 'Fatemeh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.

17406317","N-acetyl cysteine, inulin and the two as a combined therapy ameliorate cognitive decline in testosterone-deprived rats.","Our previous studies reported that testosterone-deprived rats developed cognitive decline as a result of increased brain oxidative stress, microglia hyperactivity, and hippocampal dysplasticity. In addition, gut dysbiosis occurred in these rats. Previous studies demonstrated that n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and a prebiotic (inulin) improved cognition in several pathological conditions. However, its effects on cognition in the testosterone-deprived condition have never been investigated. This study hypothesized that the administration of NAC, inulin, and a combined therapy improved cognition in castrated rats. Here we report that metabolic disturbance was not observed in the ORX rats, but gut dysbiosis was found in these rats. ORX rats developed blood-brain-barrier (BBB) breakdown, and increased brain oxidative stress as indicated by increased hippocampal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase in brain malondialdehyde level. ORX rats also demonstrated glia hyperactivation, resulting in hippocampal apoptosis, hippocampal dysplasticity, and cognitive decline. All treatments equally ameliorated cognitive decline by improving gut dysbiosis, alleviating BBB dysfunction, decreasing hippocampal ROS production, decreasing hippocampal apoptosis, and reducing microglia and astrocyte activity. These findings suggest that NAC, inulin, and the combined therapy ameliorated the deleterious effects on the brain in castrated male rats similar to those treated with testosterone.","['apoptosis', 'cognition', 'glia', 'gut dysbiosis', 'hippocampal plasticity', 'testosterone deprivation']",Aging,2019-06-05,"[{'lastname': 'Chunchai', 'firstname': 'Titikorn', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Keawtep', 'firstname': 'Puntarik', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Arinno', 'firstname': 'Apiwan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Saiyasit', 'firstname': 'Napatsorn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Prus', 'firstname': 'Dillon', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Apaijai', 'firstname': 'Nattayaporn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Pratchayasakul', 'firstname': 'Wasana', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Nipon', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nCardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Siriporn C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.\nDepartment of Oral Biology and Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.'}]",,,,,"10.18632/aging.101989

292,31145893,Measuring urinary cortisol and testosterone levels in male Barbary macaques: A comparison of EIA and LC-MS.,"The development of methods to quantify hormones from non-invasively collected samples such as urine or feces has facilitated endocrinology research on wild-living animals. To ensure that hormone measurements are biologically meaningful, method validations are strongly recommended for each new species or sample matrix. Our aim was to validate three commonly used enzyme immunoassays (EIA), one for analysis of cortisol and two for analysis of testosterone, to assess adrenocortical and gonadal endocrine activity, respectively, from the urine of male Barbary macaques. We compared EIA and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) results to determine if the EIA measurements truly reflect levels of the target hormone and to determine if antibody cross-reactivities with other steroids were potentially confounding results. Furthermore, we conducted a biological validation of testosterone to ensure that both EIA and LC-MS were able to capture physiologically meaningful differences in hormone levels. We found that cortisol measured by EIA correlated strongly with cortisol measured by LC-MS in both adult and immature males, without the need for deconjugation of steroids in the urine. Both testosterone EIAs correlated strongly with LC-MS in adult males, but only if steroids in the urine were deconjugated by enzymatic hydrolysis prior to analysis. However, in immature males, EIA and LC-MS results did not correlate significantly. Further correlation analyses suggest this is likely due to cross-reactivity of the testosterone antibodies with other adrenal steroids such as cortisol, DHEA, and likely others, which are present at much higher concentrations relative to testosterone in immature males. Testosterone levels were significantly higher in adult compared to immature males as measured by LC-MS but not as measured by EIA. Taken together, our results suggest that the testosterone EIAs are suitable to assess gonadal activity in adult but not immature males, and only if a hydrolysis of the urine is conducted prior to analysis.","['Barbary macaque', 'Cortisol', 'EIA', 'LC–MS', 'Testosterone', 'Urine']",General and comparative endocrinology,2019-05-31,"[{'lastname': 'Rincon', 'firstname': 'Alan V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioral Ecology, Johann-Friedrich-Blumenbach Institute for Zoology and Anthropology, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany; Leibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition, Goettingen, Germany.

293,31127700,Hormonal Status and Cognitivo-Emotional Profile in Real-Life Patients With Neuropathic Pain: A Case Control Study.,"The specific impact of neuropathic pain and recommended neuropathic pain treatments on the hormonal and immune status of patients has been so far poorly explored. This study aimed at studying, in real life, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the cytokine profile of patients with neuropathic pain. It also explored their links with cognition, emotion, quality of life, and drug treatment.
This prospective study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01543425) included 60 patients with neuropathic pain and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers after obtaining signatures of informed consent. A number of parameters were measured: adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, cortisol awakening response, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, sex hormone binding globulin, testosterone, 17-β-estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and vitamin D. Psychological parameters were assessed by questionnaires.
Patients with neuropathic pain had lower levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (P = 0.009) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (P < 0.001) than controls, and the cortisol awakening response was impaired. Patients were more depressed and anxious (P < 0.001) and had a diminished quality of life (P < 0.001), which was influenced by cytokines (P = 0.0067) and testosterone (P = 0.028). Antidepressants and antiepileptics appeared to interfere with testosterone and cognitivo-emotional domains.
An impairment of the hormonal status and of the immune system was observed in patients. It identified testosterone as a potential pivotal mediator between antidepressants/antiepileptics and quality of life. Further studies must address the exact impact of different types of drugs on central effects, of gender differences, and of the immune system of neuropathic pain.","['analgesics', 'hormonal status', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-gonadal axis', 'neuropathic pain']",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,2019-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Corriger', 'firstname': 'Alexandrine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire Neuro-Dol Inserm 1107, University Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Duclos', 'firstname': 'Martine', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Sports Medicine Department, University Hospital, CHU, INRA UMR 1019, UNH, CRNH, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Corcuff', 'firstname': 'Jean-Benoit', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Hormone Laboratory, Nuclear Medicine, CHU Bordeaux UMR INRA 1286 - University Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lambert', 'firstname': 'Céline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Biostatistics Unit (DRCI), University Hospital Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Marceau', 'firstname': 'Geoffroy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Biochemistry Department, University Hospital CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Sapin', 'firstname': 'Vincent', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Biochemistry Department, University Hospital CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Macian', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, CPC/CIC Inserm 1405, University Hospital CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Roux', 'firstname': 'Delphine', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, CPC/CIC Inserm 1405, University Hospital CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Biostatistics Unit (DRCI), University Hospital Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Pickering', 'firstname': 'Gisèle', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire Neuro-Dol Inserm 1107, University Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.\nClinical Pharmacology Department, CPC/CIC Inserm 1405, University Hospital CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, France.'}]",,"An impairment of the hormonal status and of the immune system was observed in patients.

294,31125595,Combined dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor with low-dose testosterone exerts greater efficacy than monotherapy on improving brain function in orchiectomized obese rats.,"Both obesity and orchiectomy lead to the development of brain pathologies and cognitive decline. Testosterone replacement therapy (2 mg/kg/day TRT) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (vildagliptin) improved cognition in orchiectomized rats, and obese rats. However, both had no beneficial effects in brain of orchiectomized-obese rats. TRT (>2 mg/kg/day) is possible to attenuate brain defects in those rats, but high dose of TRT causes adverse effects. Then, combined effect of low-dose TRT (1 mg/kg/day) and vildagliptin on brain and cognitive functions in orchiectomized-obese rats should be investigated. Sixty male rats were fed with either a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 28 weeks. At week 13, both ND and HFD-fed rats had either a sham-operation or an orchiectomy. At week 25, orchiectomized rats were treated with either: a vehicle, 2 mg/kg/day TRT, vildagliptin (3 mg/kg/day) or a combined vildagliptin with 1 mg/kg/day TRT for 4 weeks. Then, metabolic parameters, brain and cognitive functions were determined. Hippocampal oxidative stress, apoptosis, dendritic spine loss, microglial hyperactivity, and cognitive decline were found in orchiectomized ND-fed rats and sham-operated HFD-fed rats. Interestingly, orchiectomy aggravated these brain pathologies and cognitive decline in HFD-fed rats. In orchiectomized ND-fed rats, all treatments restored brain and cognitive functions. In orchiectomized HFD-fed rats, monotherapies ameliorated these brain pathologies, while the combined therapies had the greatest beneficial effect on the brains. These findings suggest the combined therapies may be the best therapeutic approach for restoring brain functions in the orchiectomized-obese condition.","['Cognitive function', 'DPP-4 inhibitor', 'Obese-insulin resistance', 'Testosterone deprivation', 'Testosterone replacement therapy']",Experimental gerontology,2019-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Keawtep', 'firstname': 'Puntarik', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Cardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Pratchayasakul', 'firstname': 'Wasana', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Cardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Arinno', 'firstname': 'Apiwan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Cardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Apaijai', 'firstname': 'Nattayaporn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chunchai', 'firstname': 'Titikorn', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Cardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kerdphoo', 'firstname': 'Sasiwan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Jaiwongkum', 'firstname': 'Thidarat', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Nipon', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Cardiac Electrophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Siriporn C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Oral Biology and Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.

295,31091047,[The medical aspect of using anabolic androgenic steroids in males attending gyms of Saint-Petersburg].,"Anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) are often used by individuals engaged in physical recreational activity. AASs inhibit the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis and can cause erectile dysfunction and reduced fertility. There is no data on the use of AASs in this category of people in the Russian Federation; therefore, a study exploring the rate and patterns of using steroids for non-medical purposes is topical. Aim - of this study was to investigate the rate and patterns of using AASs in males attending gyms in Saint Petersburg.
We used individual anonymous postal survey of males attending gyms. We analyzed demographic and anthropometric data, information on the use of AASs, awareness of their side effects, used agents, patterns and duration of their use, and rehabilitation therapy.
Out of 1,815 sent questionnaires, we received back 762 ones. The criteria were met by 550 questionnaires. The mean age was 29.3±7.4 years. The use of AASs was reported by 30.4% of respondents. The main AAS (74.3%) consumers were males aged 22 to 35 years. The most popular drug was Testosterone Propionate (51.5%); the drug was often combined with Oxandrolone (19.7%). In 70.6% of cases, drugs were administered by injection or injection combined with tablet intake. The injectable testosterone dose ranged from 500 to 2,000 mg/week and above. The most common dose was 1,000 mg/week (23.9%). AAS administration for more than 1 year was reported in 16.1% of males. Anastrozole (55%), hCG (51.3%), Clomiphene (41.3%), and Tamoxifen (30.5%) were used during the recovery period. The main source of information on AASs, doses, and dosage patterns was the Internet (48.7%). A negative attitude towards AASs was found in 17.3% of respondents. The desire to receive qualified information about AASs and their impact on health was reported by 54.8% of the surveyed respondents.
Almost every fourth gym visitor has experience in using AASs. These are males of an optimal reproductive age. The common pattern of using AASs is an aggressive steroid course followed by a recovery period. The list of used drugs and their doses indicate a significant pharmacological intervention and a high risk to health.
Обоснование. Анаболические андрогенные стероиды (ААС) нередко применяют лица, занимающиеся физической рекреационной активностью. ААС ингибируют ось гипоталамус-гипофиз-гонады и могут быть причиной развития эректильной дисфункции и снижения фертильности. В РФ отсутствуют данные о распространенности использования ААС среди этой категории людей, поэтому исследование, раскрывающее частоту и схему использования стероидов в немедицинских целях, является актуальным. Цель исследования — изучение распространенности и стереотипа применения ААС среди мужчин, посещающих тренажерные залы Санкт-Петербурга. Материал и методы. Индивидуальное заочное анонимное анкетирование мужчин, занимающихся в тренажерных залах. Изучали демографические, антропометрические данные, сведения о применении ААС, информированности о побочных эффектах их применения, используемых препаратах, схемах и длительности их применения, восстановительной терапии. Результаты. Из 1815 розданных анкет получено 762. Соответствовало критериям 550 анкет. Средний возраст составил 29,3±7,4 года. На применение ААС указали 30,4% респондентов. Основными потребителями ААС были мужчины (74,3%) в возрасте от 22 до 35 лет. Самым востребованным препаратом был тестостерона пропионат (51,5%), его чаще комбинировали с Оксандролоном (19,7%). В 70,6% случаев методом введения препаратов был инъекционный или комбинированный с приемом таблетированных препаратов. Диапазон доз инъекционного препарата тестостерона — от 500 до 2000 мг/нед и выше. Наиболее распространенная дозировка — 1000 мг в неделю (23,9%). Применяли ААС более 1 года 16,1% мужчин. В восстановительном периоде использовались Анастразол (55%), чХГ (51,3%), Кломифен (41,3%), Тамоксифен (30,5%). Основным источником информации об ААС, дозах и схемах применения был указан Интернет (48,7%). Негативное отношение к ААС сформировано у 17,3% респондентов. О желании получить квалифицированную информацию об ААС и их влиянии на здоровье высказались 54,8% принявших участие в анкетировании. Заключение. Почти каждый 4-й посетитель тренажерных залов имеет опыт применения ААС. Это мужчины оптимального репродуктивного возраста. Стереотипом использования ААС было агрессивное применение стероидов определенными курсами с последующим восстановительным периодом. Перечень используемых препаратов, их дозы указывают на значимое фармакологическое вмешательство и высокий риск для здоровья.","['abuse of steroids', 'anabolic androgenic steroids', 'athletes', 'prevalence']",Problemy endokrinologii,2019-05-16,"[{'lastname': 'Lykhonosov', 'firstname': 'M P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Pavlov First Saint Petersburg State Medical University.'}, {'lastname': 'Babenko', 'firstname': 'A Y', 'initials': 'AY', 'affiliation': 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre.'}]",,Almost every fourth gym visitor has experience in using AASs.

25192737",Anabolic-androgenic steroids and cognitive effort discounting in male rats.,"Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are drugs of abuse that impair behavior and cognition. In a rodent model of AAS abuse, testosterone-treated male rats expend more physical effort, by repeatedly pressing a lever for a large reward in an operant discounting task. However, since modern society prioritizes cognitive over physical effort, it is important to determine if AAS limit cognitive effort. Here we tested the effects of AAS on a novel cognitive-effort discounting task. Each operant chamber had 3 nose-pokes, opposite 2 levers and a pellet dispenser. Rats pressed a lever to illuminate 1 nose-poke; they responded in the illuminated nose-poke to receive sugar pellets. For the 'easy' lever, the light remained on for 1 s, and a correct response earned 1 pellet. For the 'hard' lever, the light duration decreased from 1 s to 0.1 s across 5 blocks of trials, and a correct response earned 4 pellets. As the duration of the nose-poke light decreased, all rats decreased their choice of the hard lever in a modest discounting curve. Task accuracy also decreased significantly across the 5 blocks of trials. However, there was no effect of testosterone on choice of the hard lever or task accuracy. Antagonism of dopamine D1 or D2 receptors had no effect on lever choice or task accuracy. However, serotonin depletion significantly decreased preference for the hard lever, and impaired task accuracy. Thus, physical effort discounting depends on dopamine activity, while cognitive effort discounting task is sensitive to serotonin.

25686803",Cognitive functions in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.,"There is controversy regarding cognitive function in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This study is aimed at the assessment of cognitive functions in children with CAH, and their relation to hydrocortisone (HC) therapy and testosterone levels.
Thirty children with CAH due to 21 hydroxylase deficiency were compared with twenty age- and sex-matched healthy controls. HC daily and cumulative doses were calculated, the socioeconomic standard was assessed, and free testosterone was measured. Cognitive function assessment was performed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Revised for Children and Adults (WISC), the Benton Visual Retention Test, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST).
The mean age (SD) of patients was 10.22 (3.17) years [11 males (36.7%), 19 females (63.3%)]. Mean (SD) HC dose was 15.78 (4.36) mg/m 2 /day. Mean (SD) cumulative HC dose 44,689. 9 (26,892.02) mg. Patients had significantly lower scores in all domains of the WISC test, performed significantly worse in some components of the Benton Visual Retention Test, as well as in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. There was no significant difference in cognitive performance when patients were subdivided according to daily HC dose (< 10, 10 - 15, > 15 mg/m 2 /day). A positive correlation existed between cumulative HC dose and worse results of the Benton test. No correlation existed between free testosterone and any of the three tests.

298,31033318,Cognitive performance and structural brain correlates in long-term anabolic-androgenic steroid exposed and nonexposed weightlifters.,"To test for associations between long-term anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use and cognitive functioning, and establish a candidate neuronal basis by assessing the associations between cognitive performance and brain morphology both in users and nonusers.
Eighty four previous or current AAS-users and 69 non-AAS-using male weightlifters aged 19-75 years (mean 32.6, SD 8.8) underwent MRI of the brain and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Performance on fine motor speed, speed of processing, learning and memory, working memory, executive functioning, and problem solving was compared between the groups, and between AAS users with short versus long AAS exposure. Associations between cognitive scores and regional cortical thickness and arealization defined using FreeSurfer were tested using linear models.
Relative to nonexposed, AAS-exposed weightlifters performed significantly worse on several cognitive domains, independent of age, education, verbal IQ, and exposure to classical drugs of abuse. Strongest effects were observed for speed of processing (ηp2 = .07), working memory (ηp2 = .08) and problem solving (ηp2 = .09). Longer duration of AAS-use was associated with poorer memory function (ηp2 = .11). Within AAS users, individuals with better memory and working memory performance had with thicker frontoparietal cortex and larger medial frontal surface area, respectively.
Prolonged high-dose AAS use is associated with poorer cognitive function across multiple domains, and the observed regional associations between cortical brain morphometry and memory and working memory performance may suggest differential brain-based mechanisms. The public, health care professionals, and policymakers should be aware that use of AAS in large doses potentially could lead to poorer brain health and cognition.

299,30980218,Give Me Five? Examining the Psychophysiological Effects of High-Fives in Athletes.,"High-fives are a phenomenon that is frequently observed in sports. However, investigations on effects of high-fives are missing. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine psychophysiological effects of high-fives. From an embodied cognition perspective, dynamic, upward movements compared to downward movements should activate positive concepts that are represented by psychological as well as physiological states. Thirty-four athletes performed high- and low-fives (dynamic movements) as opposed to high and low static postures (control conditions) in a double-blind, within-subject design. Psychological states (i.e., feeling motivated, feeling strong) and physiological changes (i.e., cortisol, testosterone) due to the manipulation were measured. Results showed the predicted significant interaction effect for cortisol changes, but not for the other psychological (i.e., feeling motivated, feeling strong) and physiological (testosterone) state measures. In detail, a decrease in cortisol was found after athletes performed high-fives compared to low-fives. The observed effect on cortisol should be considered with caution and needs to be replicated, however, might add information to the current discussion about the crucial relevance of movement for embodied cognition effects. Future research could investigate the effects of high-fives with a partner and add performance parameters to provide more information on the effects of high-fives on performance in sport.","['Body memory', 'Cortisol', 'Embodied cognition', 'Motivation', 'Movements', 'Testosterone']",Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback,2019-04-14,"[{'lastname': 'Lautenbach', 'firstname': 'Franziska', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Muengersdorf 6, 50933, Cologne, Germany.

17942325",Structural brain characteristics of anabolic-androgenic steroid dependence in men.,"To identify differences in brain morphology between dependent and non-dependent male anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) users.
This study used cross-sectional data from a longitudinal study on male weightlifters.
Oslo University Hospital, Norway.
Eighty-one AAS users were divided into two groups; AAS-dependent (n = 43) and AAS-non-dependent (n = 38).
Neuroanatomical volumes and cerebral cortical thickness were estimated based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using FreeSurfer. Background and health information were obtained using a semi-structured interview. AAS-dependence was evaluated in a standardized clinical interview using a version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, adapted to apply to AAS-dependence.
Compared with non-dependent users, dependent users had significantly thinner cortex in three clusters of the right hemisphere and in five clusters of the left hemisphere, including frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions. Profound differences were seen in frontal regions (left pars orbitalis, cluster-wise P < 0.001, right superior frontal, cluster-wise P < 0.001), as has been observed in other dependencies. Group differences were also seen when excluding participants with previous or current non-AAS drug abuse (left pre-central, cluster-wise P < 0.001, left pars orbitalis, cluster-wise P = 0.010).
Male dependent anabolic-androgenic steroid users appear to have thinner cortex in widespread regions, specifically in pre-frontal areas involved in inhibitory control and emotional regulation, compared with non-dependent anabolic-androgenic steroid users.","['Anabolic-androgenic steroids', 'addiction', 'cerebral cortex', 'cortical thinning', 'dependence', 'neuroimaging', 'nucleus accumbens', 'pre-frontal cortex']","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2019-04-08,"[{'lastname': 'Hauger', 'firstname': 'Lisa E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Westlye', 'firstname': 'Lars T', 'initials': 'LT', 'affiliation': 'NORMENT, KG Jebsen Centre for Psychosis Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital and Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Fjell', 'firstname': 'Anders M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Research Group for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Walhovd', 'firstname': 'Kristine B', 'initials': 'KB', 'affiliation': 'Research Group for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Bjørnebekk', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,"Male dependent anabolic-androgenic steroid users appear to have thinner cortex in widespread regions, specifically in pre-frontal areas involved in inhibitory control and emotional regulation, compared with non-dependent anabolic-androgenic steroid users.",,© 2019 The Authors.

9549549",Anabolic androgenic steroid dependence is associated with impaired emotion recognition.,"Illicit use of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) has grown into a serious public health concern throughout the Western World. AAS use is associated with adverse medical, psychological, and social consequences. Around 30% of AAS users develop a dependence syndrome with sustained use despite adverse side effects. AAS dependence is associated with a high frequency of intra- and interpersonal problems, and it is central to identify factors related to the development and maintenance of dependence.
The present study investigated the ability to recognize emotion from biological motion. The emotional biological motion task was administered to male AAS dependent users (AAS dependents; n = 45), AAS non-dependent users (AAS non-dependents; n = 38) and a comparison-group of non-using weightlifters (non-users; n = 69).
Multivariate analysis of variance showed a general impairment in emotion recognition in AAS dependents, compared to the non-using weightlifters, whereas no significant impairment was observed in AAS non-dependents. Furthermore, AAS dependents showed impaired recognition of fearful stimuli compared to both AAS non-dependents and non-using weightlifters. The between-group effect remained significant after controlling for Intelligence Quotient (IQ), past 6 months of non-AAS drug use, antisocial personality problems, anxiety, and depression.
AAS dependents show impaired emotion recognition from body movement, fear in particular, which could potentially contribute to higher frequency of interpersonal problems and antisocial behaviors in this population.","['Anabolic androgenic steroids', 'Body language', 'Dependence', 'Emotion processing', 'Emotion recognition', 'Social cognition', 'Testosterone']",Psychopharmacology,2019-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Hauger', 'firstname': 'Lisa E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Postbox 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway. haulis@ous-hf.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Sagoe', 'firstname': 'Dominic', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosocial Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaskinn', 'firstname': 'Anja', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research, KG Jebsen Centre for Psychosis Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Arnevik', 'firstname': 'Espen A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Postbox 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Leknes', 'firstname': 'Siri', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Jørstad', 'firstname': 'Marie L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Postbox 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Bjørnebekk', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Research Group, National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Postbox 4959, Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,"AAS dependents show impaired emotion recognition from body movement, fear in particular, which could potentially contribute to higher frequency of interpersonal problems and antisocial behaviors in this population.","Multivariate analysis of variance showed a general impairment in emotion recognition in AAS dependents, compared to the non-using weightlifters, whereas no significant impairment was observed in AAS non-dependents.

303,30900474,Sexuality in premature ovarian insufficiency.,"Sexuality in women with spontaneous premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) deserves attention because of the young age and the distressing impact of such a life-changing diagnosis. Biomedical and psychosocial factors work in concert to determine significant changes of sexual function. Early hormonal deprivation gives origin to symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy and contributes to hypoactive sexual desire disorder modulating central and peripheral circuitries, which regulate sexual response. Emotional and cognitive adjustment to the short-term and long-term consequences of POI may further determine negative attitudes toward sexuality. It is essential to counsel POI women on every aspect of their life, from menopausal symptoms to fertility concerns, from health risks to potential therapeutic solutions. The biopsychosocial perspective is the best approach to manage sexual symptoms, including tailored hormone therapy and focused counseling. Pharmacotherapies specifically investigated in spontaneous POI conditions are lacking and clinical judgment has to guide the choice of treatment, which must be continued at least until the average age at natural menopause according to the most recent guidelines. Further studies are needed to better characterize POI women and to understand the effective role of novel therapeutic strategies, including androgens and cognitive-behavioral and sexual interventions.","['Premature ovarian insufficiency', 'androgens', 'counseling', 'estrogens', 'female sexual dysfunction', 'female sexual function', 'psychosexual therapy']",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2019-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Nappi', 'firstname': 'R E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': 'a Research Center for Reproductive Medicine, Gynecological Endocrinology and Menopause, Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, IRCCS S.

304,30888401,Aging and the Male Reproductive System.,"This narrative review presents an overview of current knowledge on fertility and reproductive hormone changes in aging men, the factors driving and modulating these changes, their clinical consequences, and the benefits and risks of testosterone (T) therapy. Aging is accompanied by moderate decline of gamete quality and fertility. Population mean levels show a mild total T decline, an SHBG increase, a steeper free T decline, and a moderate LH increase with important contribution of comorbidities (e.g., obesity) to these changes. Sexual symptoms and lower hematocrit are associated with low T and are partly responsive to T therapy. The relationship of serum T with body composition and metabolic health is bidirectional; limited beneficial effects of T therapy on body composition have only marginal effects on metabolic health and physical function. Skeletal changes are associated primarily with estradiol and SHBG. Cognitive decline is not consistently linked to low T and is not improved by T therapy. Although limited evidence links moderate androgen decline with depressive symptoms, T therapy has small beneficial effects on mood, depressive symptoms, and vitality in elderly patients with low T. Suboptimal T (and/or DHT) has been associated with increased risk of stroke, but not of ischemic heart disease, whereas an association with mortality probably reflects that low T is a marker of poor health. Globally, neither severity of clinical consequences attributable to low T nor the nature and magnitude of beneficial treatment effects justify the concept of some broadly applied ""T replacement therapy"" in older men with low T. Moreover, long-term safety of T therapy is not established.",[],Endocrine reviews,2019-03-20,"[{'lastname': 'Kaufman', 'firstname': 'Jean-Marc', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Lapauw', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahmoud', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': ""T'Sjoen"", 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Huhtaniemi', 'firstname': 'Ilpo Tapani', 'initials': 'IT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Physiology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.,10.1210/er.2018-00178,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de297e00>,,,,,,
305,30825729,Nonverbal cognition across genetic and environmentally informative kinships: The case for opposite-sex twin pairs and virtual twins.,"The extent to which prenatal intrauterine testosterone affects cognitive development in females has been of interest. Previous twin research has, however, been limited in its attempts to disentangle prenatal and psychosocial environmental factors influencing cognitive development. The current study applied a novel approach to addressing this concern. Specifically, the nonverbal cognitive performances of female opposite-sex dizygotic co-twins (DZOSfs) and female opposite-sex virtual co-twins (same-age unrelated siblings or VTOSfs) were compared to separate the biological and environmental influences on the nonverbal IQ score and its component subtests. The DZOSf twins showed a trend toward outperforming the younger VTOSf twins on the Block Design subtest only. Using these biologically and environmentally informative kinships offers a novel approach to understanding sex differences in nonverbal cognition. Including VTOSfs as a comparison group creates an experimental design that eliminates confounds and spurious associations left unaddressed in prior twin research.","['Cognition', 'Opposite-sex', 'Postnatal environment', 'Prenatal environment', 'Testosterone', 'Twins', 'Virtual twins']",Journal of experimental child psychology,2019-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Segal', 'firstname': 'Nancy L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, California State University, Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92834, USA.

20644343",Adrenal Aging and Its Implications on Stress Responsiveness in Humans.,"Normal aging results in subtle changes both in ACTH and cortisol secretion. Most notable is the general increase in mean daily serum cortisol levels in the elderly, without a noteworthy alteration in the normal circadian rhythm pattern. Glucocorticoid excess seen in the elderly population can have serious consequences in both the structural and functional integrity of various key areas in the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, with consequent impairment in normal memory, cognitive function, and sleep cycles. The chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels also impinge on the normal stress response in the elderly, leading to an impaired ability to recover from stressful stimuli. In addition to the effects on the brain, glucocorticoid excess is associated with other age-related changes, including loss of muscle mass, hypertension, osteopenia, visceral obesity, and diabetes, among others. In contrast to the increase in glucocorticoid levels, other adrenocortical hormones, particularly serum aldosterone and DHEA (the precursor to androgens and estrogens) show significant decreases in the elderly. The underlying mechanisms for their decrease remain unclear. While the adrenomedullary hormone, norephinephrine, shows an increase in plasma levels, associated with a decrease in clearance, no notable changes observed in plasma epinephrine levels in the elderly. The multiplicity and complexity of the adrenal hormone changes observed throughout the normal aging process, suggests that age-related alterations in cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence specific to the adrenal gland must also be considered.","['HPA axis', 'adrenal cortex', 'glucocorticoids', 'senescence', 'stress']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2019-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Yiallouris', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.\nLaboratory of Education & Research Neuroscience, Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University Athens, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsioutis', 'firstname': 'Constantinos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.\nSociety of Junior Doctors, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Agapidaki', 'firstname': 'Eirini', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.'}, {'lastname': 'Zafeiri', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Society of Junior Doctors, Athens, Greece.\nDiabetes and Obesity Center, Konstantopouleio Hospital, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Agouridis', 'firstname': 'Aris P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.'}, {'lastname': 'Ntourakis', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth O', 'initials': 'EO', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.\nLaboratory of Education & Research Neuroscience, Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University Athens, Athens, Greece.'}]",,,,,"10.3389/fendo.2019.00054

20097718",Neuron-Derived Estrogen Regulates Synaptic Plasticity and Memory.,"17β-estradiol (E2) is produced from androgens via the action of the enzyme aromatase. E2 is known to be made in neurons in the brain, but its precise functions in the brain are unclear. Here, we used a forebrain-neuron-specific aromatase knock-out (FBN-ARO-KO) mouse model to deplete neuron-derived E2 in the forebrain of mice and thereby elucidate its functions.

309,30639342,"Exogenous testosterone and the monoamine-oxidase A polymorphism influence anger, aggression and neural responses to provocation in males.","Testosterone and the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA) polymorphism are potential neuromodulators for aggression. By acting on similar brain circuits, they might interactively influence human behavior. The current study investigates the causal role of testosterone on aggression-related brain activity and the potential interaction with the MAOA polymorphism. In a double-blind process, 93 healthy males received a testosterone or placebo gel. In an fMRI session, participants performed a Taylor aggression paradigm in which they received provoking feedback and could afterwards decide how aggressively they would react. Testosterone and cortisol levels as well as subjective anger were assessed prior and after the task. Circulating testosterone levels were higher in carriers of the long compared to the short MAOA allele. An interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and testosterone administration was identified in the cuneus, where short allele carriers in the placebo group showed diminished activity in the decision period. Task-related anger was significantly higher in this group. Overall, a mesocorticolimbic network was implicated in processing of high versus low provoking feedback, and core hubs of the default mode network were implicated in the subsequent decision after high versus low provocation. Testosterone administration increased activation in this network. The data provides evidence for an interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and exogenous testosterone on anger and suggests that interactive effects on the brain signal could underlie differential emotional reactivity. The increased default mode activation in the testosterone group suggests an enhanced engagement of social cognition related regions possibly supporting responsivity towards social provocation.

23867118","Sex-specific contribution of DHEA-cortisol ratio to prefrontal-hippocampal structural development, cognitive abilities and personality traits.","Although dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may exert neuroprotective effects in the developing brain, prolonged or excessive elevations in cortisol may exert neurotoxic effects. The ratio between DHEA and cortisol (DC ratio) has been linked to internalising and externalising disorders, as well as cognitive performance, supporting the clinical relevance of this hormonal ratio during development. However, the brain mechanisms by which these effects may be mediated have not yet been identified. Furthermore, although there is evidence that the effects of cortisol in the central nervous system may be sexually dimorphic in humans, the opposite is true for DHEA, with human studies showing no sex-specific associations in cortical thickness, cortico-amygdalar or cortico-hippocampal structural covariance. Therefore, it remains unclear whether sex moderates the developmental associations between DC ratio, brain structure, cognition and behaviour. In the present study, we examined the associations between DC ratio, structural covariance of the hippocampus with whole-brain cortical thickness, and measures of personality, behaviour and cognition in a longitudinal sample of typically developing children, adolescents and young adults aged 6-22 years (N = 225 participants [F = 128]; 355 scans [F = 208]), using mixed effects models that accounted for both within- and between-subject variances. We found sex-specific interactions between DC ratio and anterior cingulate cortex-hippocampal structural covariance, with higher DC ratios being associated with a more negative covariance between these structures in girls, and a more positive covariance in boys. Furthermore, the negative prefrontal-hippocampal structural covariance found in girls was associated with higher verbal memory and mathematical ability, whereas the positive covariance found in boys was associated with lower cooperativeness and reward dependence personality traits. These findings support the notion that the ratio between DHEA and cortisol levels may contribute, at least in part, to the development of sex differences in cognitive abilities, as well as risk for internalising/externalising disorders, via an alteration in prefrontal-hippocampal structure during the transition from childhood to adulthood.","['adolescence', 'adrenarche', 'androgens', 'cognition', 'puberty']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2019-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Farooqi', 'firstname': 'Nasr A I', 'initials': 'NAI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Scotti', 'firstname': 'Martina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Ally', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lew', 'firstname': 'Jimin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Monnier', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics-Gynecology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nResearch Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Botteron', 'firstname': 'Kelly N', 'initials': 'KN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.\nBrain Development Cooperative Group.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Benjamin C', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.'}, {'lastname': 'Booij', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nCHU Sainte Justine Hospital Research Centre, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Herba', 'firstname': 'Catherine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'CHU Sainte Justine Hospital Research Centre, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychology, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Séguin', 'firstname': 'Jean R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'CHU Sainte Justine Hospital Research Centre, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Addiction, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Castellanos-Ryan', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'CHU Sainte Justine Hospital Research Centre, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nSchool of Psychoeducation, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'McCracken', 'firstname': 'James T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Brain Development Cooperative Group.\nDepartment of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of California in Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Tuong-Vi', 'initials': 'TV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nDepartment of Obstetrics-Gynecology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nResearch Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}]",,,,© 2018 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/jne.12682,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de130090>,,,,,,
311,30580011,Contributions of sex to cerebrovascular function and pathology.,"Sex differences exist in how cerebral blood vessels function under both physiological and pathological conditions, contributing to observed sex differences in risk and outcomes of cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs), such as vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and stroke. Throughout most of the lifespan, women are protected from CBVDs; however, risk increases following menopause, suggesting sex hormones may play a significant role in this protection. The cerebrovasculature is a target for sex hormones, including estrogens, progestins, and androgens, where they can influence numerous vascular functions and pathologies. While there is a plethora of information on estrogen, the effects of progestins and androgens on the cerebrovasculature are less well-defined. Estrogen decreases cerebral tone and increases cerebral blood flow, while androgens increase tone. Both estrogens and androgens enhance angiogenesis/cerebrovascular remodeling. While both estrogens and androgens attenuate cerebrovascular inflammation, pro-inflammatory effects of androgens under physiological conditions have also been demonstrated. Sex hormones exert additional neuroprotective effects by attenuating oxidative stress and maintaining integrity and function of the blood brain barrier. Most animal studies utilize young, healthy, gonadectomized animals, which do not mimic the clinical conditions of aging individuals likely to get CBVDs. This is also concerning, as sex hormones appear to mediate cerebrovascular function differently based on age and disease state (e.g. metabolic syndrome). Through this review, we hope to inspire others to consider sex as a key biological variable in cerebrovascular research, as greater understanding of sex differences in cerebrovascular function will assist in developing personalized approaches to prevent and treat CBVDs.","['Cerebrovascular disease', 'Dementia', 'Sex differences', 'Sex hormones', 'Stroke', 'Vascular']",Brain research,2018-12-24,"[{'lastname': 'Robison', 'firstname': 'Lisa S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208, United States.

24130763","Effects of β-alanine supplementation on physical performance, cognition, endocrine function, and inflammation during a 24 h simulated military operation.","Sustained military operations (SUSOPs) are associated with performance decrements and cognitive dysfunction. β-Alanine (BA) supplementation may have a role in increasing soldier resiliency by enhancing muscle-buffering capacity and reducing oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of BA on physical performance, cognition, endocrine function, and inflammation during a 24 h simulated SUSOP. Nineteen males were randomized into one of two groups: BA (n = 10) or placebo (n = 9; PLA) (12 g/day) for 14 days preceding the 24 h SUSOP. Assessments were performed at 0 h (0H), 12 h (12H), and 24 h (24H) during the SUSOP. No changes in visual tracking ability, jump power, or upper-body muscular endurance were observed between groups or time points (P's > 0.05). Increases in subjective feelings of soreness and fatigue were noted at 12H compared to 0H (P < 0.05) in PLA, but not in BA. Visual reaction time for PLA was slower at 24H compared to 0H (P = 0.035), and PLA made more errors on reaction time testing at 12H compared to BA (P = 0.048), but motor reaction time was faster (P = 0.016) for PLA.

In the current study, a meta-analysis (including 30 papers with 33 studies, 49 effect sizes, n = 8538) on the interaction effect of testosterone and cortisol on status-relevant behavior (i.e. status, dominance, risk taking, aggression, and psychopathy) was performed. There was only marginal support for the dual-hormone hypothesis: The effect size of the interaction between testosterone and cortisol on status-relevant behavior was significant but very small (r = -.061, p =  .026), which was corroborated by follow-up meta-analyses on simple slopes on low and high cortisol. Effect sizes were largest for direct status measures, although not significantly different from other outcome measures. Similarly, effect sizes seemed larger for men than for women. However, robustness analyses indicated signs of publication bias, enhanced significance due to potential flexibility in data-analysis, and a lack of power of individual studies, emphasizing the need for a large, pre-registered study.","['Aggression', 'Cortisol', 'Dual-hormone', 'Interaction', 'Meta-analysis', 'Simple slopes', 'Status-relevant behavior', 'Testosterone']",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2018-12-12,"[{'lastname': 'Dekkers', 'firstname': 'Tycho J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'University of Amsterdam, Department of Psychology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Forensic Psychiatry and Complex Behavioral Disorders, De Bascule - Academic Center for Child- and Adolescent Psychiatry, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

9689128",The Influence of Endogenous Opioids on the Relationship between Testosterone and Romantic Bonding.,"The endogenous opioid system has received attention and extensive research for its effects on reward, pleasure, and pain. However, relative to other neurochemicals, such as oxytocin, vasopressin and dopamine, the function of opioids in regulating human attachment, sociosexuality, and other aspects of human sociality has not received much consideration. For example, nonapeptides (oxytocin and vasopressin) have been extensively studied in animals and humans for their possible roles in mother-offspring attachment, romantic attachment, fatherhood, and social cognition. Likewise, others have proposed models wherein oxytocin and vasopressin are moderators of the relationship between steroid hormones and human social behaviors. Recently, opioids have generated renewed interest in relation to social pain, and importantly, the brain opioid hypothesis of social attachment (BOTSA), which suggests that endogenous opioids are a key implementer in primate and human bonding, has received some support. Here we focus on romantic bonds by proposing that endogenous opioids are an important mechanism mediating reproductive trade-offs through their inhibitory effects on testosterone production.","['Mating effort', 'Opioids', 'Pair bonding', 'Parenting effort', 'Testosterone']","Human nature (Hawthorne, N.Y.)",2018-12-07,"[{'lastname': 'Ponzi', 'firstname': 'Davide', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078-3064, USA. davide.ponzi@okstate.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Dandy', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078-3064, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s12110-018-9332-4,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de11e9f0>,,,,,,

Male Wistar rats (n = 24) were fed with either normal-diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks. At week 13, ND-fed rats and HFD-fed rats were randomly assigned to two subgroups to receive either a sham-operation or bilateral-orchiectomy (ORX). Rats were evaluated for metabolic parameters and cognition at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the operation. At the end of protocol, the reactive oxygen species (ROS), glial morphology, and cell apoptosis were determined in hippocampus and cortex.
Both HFD-fed groups developed obese-insulin resistance, but ND-fed rats did not. HFD-fed rats with sham-operation showed cognitive decline, when compared to ND-fed rats with sham-operation at all time points. At 4- and 8-week after ORX, the cognitive impairment of ND-fed rats and both HFD-fed groups was not different. However, 12-week after ORX, cognitive decline and of glial hyperactivity of HFD-fed rats had the greatest increase among all groups. Hippocampal ROS levels and apoptotic cells in both HFD-fed groups were equally increased, but the cortical ROS levels and apoptotic cells of HFD-fed rats with ORX were the highest ones.

316,30514653,"Salivary Pubertal Hormones, Sleep Disturbance, and an Evening Circadian Preference in Adolescents: Risk Across Health Domains.","Puberty influences biological and psychological development during adolescence. This includes a shift toward an evening circadian preference, which is characterized by greater physical and mental activity at night compared to the morning. This study examines how pubertal hormones are related to risk across key health domains among adolescents with an evening circadian preference.
Participants were adolescents with an evening circadian preference (n = 165, 96 female and 69 male, mean age = 14.8) from an NICHD-funded study. Hormones included testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and estradiol (females only). Sleep measures included weeknight total sleep time and weeknight bedtime. Circadian preference was assessed with the Children's Morningness-Eveningness Preferences Scale. Health domains included emotional, cognitive, behavioral, social, and physical health.
For female adolescents, estradiol was related to higher risk in the emotional domain. Among female adolescents with later bedtimes, higher estradiol was associated with higher behavioral domain risk (specifically alcohol and substance use). For male adolescents with a more extreme evening circadian preference, higher DHEA and testosterone were associated with higher behavioral domain risk, specifically greater alcohol and substance use or sensation seeking (DHEA only). Among female adolescents with a more extreme evening circadian preference, higher DHEA was associated with greater physical health risk.
Pubertal hormones may be associated with heightened risk across select health domains. Specifically, higher levels of hormones may contribute to increased risk for alcohol and substance use as well as sensation seeking in the context of an evening circadian preference.","['Circadian preference', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Puberty', 'Sleep']",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,2018-12-06,"[{'lastname': 'Dolsen', 'firstname': 'Emily A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Deardorff', 'firstname': 'Julianna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Harvey', 'firstname': 'Allison G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California.

15150608",No Relationship of Anti-Androgens to Alzheimer's Disease or Cognitive Disorder in the MedWatch Database.,"Two large studies suggest that risk is not increased. But other studies have found increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and impaired cognition.
To determine whether androgen deprivation therapy increases the risk of impaired cognition or Alzheimer's disease in men with prostate cancer.
We used data from MedWatch, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. Machine-readable data from MedWatch, including adverse drug reaction reports from manufacturers, are part of a public database. We used the online tool OpenVigil 2.1 to query the database. OpenVigil calculates proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) from adverse drug reaction reports to determine whether the combination of drug and adverse event are related. For example, PRR = 2 indicates that the adverse reaction is two times more frequent in users of the drug than in the general population.
We analyzed adverse event reporting data for these androgen-deprivation drugs: The luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists leuprolide, goserelin triptorelin, histrelin; the anti-androgens flutamide, nilutamide, enzalutamide, and bicalutamide; the LHRH antagonist degarelix; the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone; the anti-fungal ketoconazole, which is also an anti-androgen administered to men with advanced prostate cancer.

318,30468786,Impact of neuroimmune activation induced by alcohol or drug abuse on adolescent brain development.,"Evidence obtained in recent decades has demonstrated that the brain still matures in adolescence. Changes in neural connectivity occur in different regions, including cortical and subcortical structures, which undergo modifications in white and gray matter densities. These alterations concomitantly occur in some neurotransmitter systems and hormone secretion, which markedly influence the refinement of certain brain areas and neural circuits. The immaturity of the adolescent brain makes it more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and drug abuse, whose use can trigger long-term behavioral dysfunction. This article reviews the action of alcohol and drug abuse (cannabis, cocaine, opioids, amphetamines, anabolic androgenic steroids) in the adolescent brain, and their impact on both cognition and behavioral dysfunction, including predisposition to drug abuse in later life. It also discusses recent evidence that indicates the role of the neuroimmune system response and neuroinflammation as mechanisms that participate in many actions of ethanol and drug abuse in adolescence, including the neurotoxicity and alterations in neurocircuitry that contribute to the dysfunctional behaviors associated with addiction. The new data suggest the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory targets to prevent the long-term consequences of drug abuse in adolescence.","['Adolescence', 'Alcohol', 'Drug abuse', 'Innate immune response', 'Neuroinflammation', 'TLRs']",International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,2018-11-24,"[{'lastname': 'Guerri', 'firstname': 'Consuelo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathology of Alcohol, Príncipe Felipe Research Center, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Pascual', 'firstname': 'María', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathology of Alcohol, Príncipe Felipe Research Center, Valencia, Spain.\nDepartment of Physiology, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

18410780",Androgen treatment effects on hippocampus structure in boys with Klinefelter syndrome.,"Klinefelter syndrome (KS, 47,XXY) is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy in males. A variety of complex clinical needs is associated with KS, including physical, cognitive and psychosocial impairments. Standard treatment for KS consists of androgen replacement therapy in adolescence to offset testosterone deficiency. Such treatment has a beneficial effect on the physical and behavioral manifestations of this syndrome. Whether androgen supplementation has a significant influence on the brain, however, is unknown. In the current study, we examined regional gray matter volume in boys with KS to assess whether treatment with oxandrolone, a synthetic hormone analog of testosterone, was associated with structural changes in the brain. Specifically, we focused our investigation on the hippocampus, given (1) its involvement in KS, and (2) the high concentration of androgen receptors found in this region. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data was acquired from a subsample of boys who completed a 2-year double-blind clinical trial in which patients were randomized to treatment with oxandrolone or to placebo, as well as from a sample of typically developing (TD) boys. Group differences in hippocampal volume were examined. A significant main effect of group was observed. Pairwise comparisons indicated smaller hippocampal volume in the placebo group relative to the oxandrolone group, as well as smaller volume in the placebo group relative to the TD control group. No difference in volume was observed between the treatment and TD groups. Moreover, across KS subgroups, a significant positive association was observed between hippocampus volume and performance on a spatial memory task, indicating treatment-based changes in brain structure may underlie cognitive change. These findings confirm prior reports implicating a role of the hippocampus in KS and are important in extending previous research by demonstrating a significant effect of androgens on brain structure.","['Androgens', 'Cognition', 'Genetics', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Structural magnetic resonance imaging']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2018-11-06,"[{'lastname': 'Foland-Ross', 'firstname': 'Lara C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94304, United States.

19859074","Effects of aging, high-fat diet, and testosterone treatment on neural and metabolic outcomes in male brown Norway rats.","Risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is affected by multiple factors, including aging, obesity, and low testosterone. We previously showed that obesity and low testosterone independently and interactively exacerbate AD-related outcomes in young adult rodents. The goals of the present study are two-fold: to examine whether the effects of an obesogenic diet differ with increasing age and to determine if testosterone treatment in middle-aged and aged animals mitigates negative effects of the diet. Male brown Norway rats were maintained on control or high-fat diets for 12 weeks beginning in young adulthood, middle age, or advanced age. Separate cohorts of middle-aged and aged animals were treated with testosterone during dietary manipulations. Endpoints included metabolic indices, inflammation, cognitive performance, and neural health outcomes. Aging was associated with poorer outcomes that were generally exacerbated by high-fat diet, especially at middle age. Testosterone treatment was largely without benefit, exerting only subtle effects on a select number of measures. Understanding how the deleterious effects of obesity are affected by advancing age and the ability of protective strategies such as testosterone to reduce these effects may provide significant insight into both the development and prevention of age-related cognitive decline and AD.","['Aging', 'Diet-induced obesity', 'High-fat diet', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Testosterone']",Neurobiology of aging,2018-10-26,"[{'lastname': 'Moser', 'firstname': 'V Alexandra', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Christensen', 'firstname': 'Amy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Jiahui', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Amanda', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yagi', 'firstname': 'Shunya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Beam', 'firstname': 'Christopher R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Galea', 'firstname': 'Liisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pike', 'firstname': 'Christian J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

17178554",Androgens modulate chronic intermittent hypoxia effects on brain and behavior.,"Sleep apnea is associated with testosterone dysregulation as well as increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A rodent model of the hypoxemic events of sleep apnea, chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), has been previously documented to impair cognitive function and elevate oxidative stress in male rats, while simultaneously decreasing testosterone. Therefore, androgens may modulate neuronal function under CIH. To investigate the role of androgens during CIH, male rats were assigned to one of four hormone groups: 1) gonadally intact, 2) gonadectomized (GDX), 3) GDX + testosterone (T) supplemented, or 4) GDX + dihydrotestosterone (DHT) supplemented. Each group was exposed to either normal room air or CIH exposure for one week, followed by memory and motor task assessments. Brain regions associated with AD and PD (entorhinal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and substantia nigra) were examined for oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, key characteristics of AD and PD. Gonadally intact rats exhibited elevated oxidative stress due to CIH, but no significant memory and motor impairments. GDX increased memory impairments, regardless of CIH exposure. T preserved memory function and prevented detrimental CIH-induced changes. In contrast, DHT was not protective, as evidenced by exacerbated oxidative stress under CIH. Further, CIH induced significant spatial memory impairment in rats administered DHT. These results indicate androgens can have both neuroprotective and detrimental effects under CIH, which may have clinical relevance for men with untreated sleep apnea.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Astrocytes', 'Dihydrotestosterone', 'Entorhinal cortex', 'Hippocampus', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Oxidative stress', ""Parkinson's disease"", 'Substantia nigra', 'Testosterone']",Hormones and behavior,2018-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Snyder', 'firstname': 'Brina', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Anatomy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Duong', 'firstname': 'Phong', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Anatomy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Trieu', 'firstname': 'Jenny', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Cunningham', 'firstname': 'Rebecca L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Anatomy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, United States of America.

724398",Prenatal testosterone does not explain sex differences in spatial ability.,"The most consistent sex differences in cognition are found for spatial ability, in which males, on average, outperform females. Utilizing a twin design, two studies have shown that females with male co-twins perform better than females with female co-twins on a mental rotation task. According to the Twin Testosterone Transfer hypothesis (TTT) this advantage is due to in-uterine transmission of testosterone from males to females. The present study tested the TTT across 14 different spatial ability measures, including mental rotation tasks, in a large sample of 19-21-year-old twins.

323,30207255,The contribution of brain imaging to the understanding of psychopathy.,"Psychopathy is a personality type characterized by both callous emotional dysfunction and deviant behavior that affects society in the form of actions that harm others. Historically, researchers have been concerned with seeking data and arguments to support a neurobiological foundation of psychopathy. In the past few years, increasing research has begun to reveal brain alterations putatively underlying the enigmatic psychopathic personality. In this review, we describe the brain anatomical and functional features that characterize psychopathy from a synthesis of available neuroimaging research and discuss how such brain anomalies may account for psychopathic behavior. The results are consistent in showing anatomical alterations involving primarily a ventral system connecting the anterior temporal lobe to anterior and ventral frontal areas, and a dorsal system connecting the medial frontal lobe to the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus complex and, in turn, to medial structures of the temporal lobe. Functional imaging data indicate that relevant emotional flow breakdown may occur in both these brain systems and suggest specific mechanisms via which emotion is anomalously integrated into cognition in psychopathic individuals during moral challenge. Directions for future research are delineated emphasizing, for instance, the relevance of further establishing the contribution of early life stress to a learned blockage of emotional self-exposure, and the potential role of androgenic hormones in the development of cortical anomalies.","['Antisocial behavior', 'MRI', 'brain', 'emotional dysfunction', 'functional connectivity', 'moral dilemmas']",Psychological medicine,2018-09-13,"[{'lastname': 'Pujol', 'firstname': 'Jesus', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'MRI Research Unit, Department of Radiology,Hospital del Mar,CIBERSAM G21, Barcelona,Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Harrison', 'firstname': 'Ben J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry,Melbourne Neuropsychiatry Centre, The University of Melbourne and Melbourne Health,Melbourne,Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Contreras-Rodriguez', 'firstname': 'Oren', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Psychiatry Department,Bellvitge University Hospital, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute-IDIBELL,CIBERSAM G17, Barcelona,Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cardoner', 'firstname': 'Narcis', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mental Health, Corporació Sanitaria Parc Taulí, Sabadell, and Department of Psychiatry,Autonomous University of Barcelona,Barcelona,Spain.'}]",,,,,10.1017/S0033291718002507,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddfdae00>,,,,,,

Our retrospective study reports the neuropsychological evaluations of a large cohort of patients in order to contribute towards the understanding of this field. We consider 64 neuropsychological evaluations assessing mnesic, linguistic and executive functions collected from 2013 to 2015 in patients attending at Motor Neuron Disease Centre of University of Padova. The battery consisted in: Digit Span forwards and backwards, Prose Memory test, Phonemic Verbal fluency and Trail making tests. ANCOVA statistics were employed to compare tests scores results with those obtained from a sample of healthy control subjects. Multiple linear regressions were used to study the effect on cognitive performance of CAG-repeat expansion, the degree of androgen insensitivity and their interaction to cognitive performance. Statistical analyses did not reveal altered scores in any neuropsychological tests among those adopted. Interestingly, patients performed significantly better in the Prose Memory test's score. No relevant associations were found with genetic, hormonal or clinical patients' profile. Results inconsistent with previous studies have been interpreted according to the phenomenon of somatic mosaicism. We suggest a testosterone-related and the mood state-dependant perspectives as two possible interpretations of the enhanced performances in the Prose Memory test. Further studies employing more datailed tests batteries are encouraged.",[],Scientific reports,2018-09-13,"[{'lastname': 'Marcato', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences (DNS), University of Padova Via Giustiniani, 2 - 35128, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Kleinbub', 'firstname': 'J R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Philosophy, Sociology, Pedagogy and Applied Psychology (FISPPA), University of Padova Piazza Capitaniato, 3 - 35139, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Querin', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences (DNS), University of Padova Via Giustiniani, 2 - 35128, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pick', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Philosophy, Sociology, Pedagogy and Applied Psychology (FISPPA), University of Padova Piazza Capitaniato, 3 - 35139, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Martinelli', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences (DNS), University of Padova Via Giustiniani, 2 - 35128, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bertolin', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences (DNS), University of Padova Via Giustiniani, 2 - 35128, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cipolletta', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Psychology, University of Padova via Venezia, 8 -35131, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pegoraro', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences (DNS), University of Padova Via Giustiniani, 2 - 35128, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Sorarù', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences (DNS), University of Padova Via Giustiniani, 2 - 35128, Padova, Italy. gianni.soraru@unipd.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Palmieri', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Philosophy, Sociology, Pedagogy and Applied Psychology (FISPPA), University of Padova Piazza Capitaniato, 3 - 35139, Padova, Italy. arianna.palmieri@unipd.it.\nPadova Neuroscience Center (PNC), University of Padova Via Orus, 2 - 35129, Padova, Italy. arianna.palmieri@unipd.it.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-018-32062-5

325,30201120,"Saliva oxytocin, cortisol, and testosterone levels in adolescent boys with autism spectrum disorder, oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder and typically developing individuals.","The aim of the current study was to compare levels of oxytocin, cortisol, and testosterone in adolescents with either autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)/conduct disorder (CD), and in typically developing individuals (TDI), and relate hormone levels to severity and subtype of aggression and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Saliva concentrations of oxytocin, cortisol, and testosterone were assessed in 114 male participants (N = 49 ASD, N = 37 ODD/CD, N = 28 TDI,) aged 12-19 years (M = 15.4 years, SD = 1.9). The ASD and the ODD/CD groups had significantly lower levels of oxytocin than the TDI group, and the ODD/CD group had significantly higher levels of testosterone than the ASD group. There were no group effects on cortisol levels. Group differences remained for oxytocin after correcting for the influence of CU traits, but were not significant after controlling for aggression. Results for testosterone became non-significant after correction for either CU traits or aggression. Across groups, higher levels of CU traits were related to higher levels of cortisol and testosterone, however, proactive and reactive aggression were unrelated to all three hormonal levels. The current findings show that, regardless of cognitive ability or comorbid disorders, the diagnostic groups (ASD, ODD/CD) differ from each other by their hormonal levels, with the ASD group characterized by relative low level of oxytocin, and the ODD/CD group by a relative low level of oxytocin and high level of testosterone. These group effects were partly driven by differences in CU traits between the groups.","['Autism spectrum disorder', 'CU traits', 'Conduct disorder', 'Cortisol', 'Empathy', 'Oxytocin', 'Testosterone']",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2018-09-12,"[{'lastname': 'Bakker-Huvenaars', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Greven', 'firstname': 'C U', 'initials': 'CU', 'affiliation': ""Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; King's College London, Medical Research Council Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Herpers', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiegers', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Jansen', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Steen', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Herwaarden', 'firstname': 'A E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Baanders', 'firstname': 'A N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'Stichting Otto Gerhard Heldring, Zetten, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Nijhof', 'firstname': 'K S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'Pluryn, Hoenderloo, The Netherlands; Department of Developmental Psychopathology, Behavioral Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Scheepers', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Brain Centre Rudolf Magnus, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Rommelse', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Glennon', 'firstname': 'J C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Buitelaar', 'firstname': 'J K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

326,30144781,Sex hormones and incident dementia in older men: The health in men study.,"Low circulating testosterone has been associated with dementia in older men but existing evidence from prospective studies is inconsistent.
We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 4069 community-dwelling older men free of dementia aged 71-88 years at baseline. The main objective of the study was to determine if men with low circulating sex hormones were more likely to develop dementia over time. The main biochemical exposures of interest were collected at baseline between 2001 and 2004 and men were assessed for incident dementia via an electronic health records database to the 31 st of December 2013.
Dementia developed in 499 men over a median of 10.5 years (range 9.4-12.2 years). The risk of developing dementia increased with decreasing total (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.03-1.26 per standard deviation decrease) and calculated free testosterone (HR 1.18, 95%CI 1.06-1.31 per standard deviation decrease) after adjustment for age, baseline cognitive function, depression, body mass, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and total plasma homocysteine. Men in the lowest quartiles of total (adjusted HR 1.39, 95%CI 1.04-1.85) and calculated free testosterone (adjusted HR 1.43, 95%CI 1.08-1.90) had increased risk of developing dementia compared to those in the highest quartiles.
Lower plasma total and calculated free testosterone were associated with increased risk of developing dementia independent of relevant measured clinical and biochemical factors and was not explained due to differential mortality in those with lower testosterone levels. The association between low testosterone and dementia is biologically plausible but data on the role of testosterone treatment in preventing dementia is lacking and adequately powered trials in men at risk would be welcome.","['Dementia', 'Older men', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2018-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Ford', 'firstname': 'Andrew H', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, Western Australia, 6009, Australia; WA Centre for Health & Ageing, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, Western Australia, 6009, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Royal Perth Hospital, GPO Box X2213, Perth, Western Australia, 6847, Australia.

19446808",Developmental exposures to ultrafine particle air pollution reduces early testosterone levels and adult male social novelty preference: Risk for children's sex-biased neurobehavioral disorders.,"Epidemiological studies have reported associations of air pollution exposures with various neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit and schizophrenia, all of which are male-biased in prevalence. Our studies of early postnatal exposure of mice to the ultrafine particle (UFP) component of air pollution, considered the most reactive component, provide support for these epidemiological associations, demonstrating male-specific or male-biased neuropathological changes and cognitive and impulsivity deficits consistent with these disorders. Since these neurodevelopmental disorders also include altered social behavior and communication, the current study examined the ability of developmental UFP exposure to reproduce these social behavior deficits and to determine whether any observed alterations reflected changes in steroid hormone concentrations. Elevated plus maze, social conditioned place preference, and social novelty preference were examined in adult mice that had been exposed to concentrated (10-20x) ambient UFPs averaging approximately 45 ug/m","['Air pollution', 'Fetal origins', 'Sex-specific', 'Social behavior', 'Testosterone']",Neurotoxicology,2018-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Sobolewski', 'firstname': 'Marissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Anderson', 'firstname': 'Timothy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Conrad', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Marvin', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Klocke', 'firstname': 'Carolyn', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Morris-Schaffer', 'firstname': 'Keith', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Allen', 'firstname': 'Joshua L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Cory-Slechta', 'firstname': 'Deborah A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY, United States.

Previous studies revealed the existence of an AR gene mutation-negative group of patients with AIS who have compromised androgen receptor (AR) function (AIS type II).
To investigate whether AIS type II can be due to epigenetic repression of AR transcription.
Quantification of AR mRNA and AR proximal promoter CpG methylation levels in genital skin-derived fibroblasts (GFs) derived from patients with AIS type II and control individuals.
University hospital endocrine research laboratory.
GFs from control individuals (n = 11) and patients with AIS type II (n = 14).
Measurement of AR mRNA and AR promoter CpG methylation as well as activity of AR proximal promoter in vitro.
Fifty-seven percent of individuals with AIS type II (n = 8) showed a reduced AR mRNA expression in their GFs. A significant inverse correlation was shown between AR mRNA abundance and methylation at two consecutive CpGs within the proximal AR promoter. Methylation of a 158-bp-long region containing these CpGs was sufficient to severely reduce reporter gene expression. This region was bound by the runt related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1). Ectopic expression of RUNX1 in HEK293T cells was able to inhibit reporter gene expression through this region.
Aberrant CpGs methylation within the proximal AR promoter plays an important role in the control of AR gene expression and may result in AIS type II. We suggest that transcriptional modifiers, such as RUNX1, could play roles therein offering new perspectives for understanding androgen-mediated endocrine diseases.",[],The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2018-08-21,"[{'lastname': 'Hornig', 'firstname': 'Nadine C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.\nInstitute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodens', 'firstname': 'Pascal', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dörr', 'firstname': 'Helmuth', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hubner', 'firstname': 'Nina C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour-Centre for Neuroscience, GL Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Kulle', 'firstname': 'Alexandra E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schweikert', 'firstname': 'Hans-Udo', 'initials': 'HU', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Division III, Universitätsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Welzel', 'firstname': 'Maik', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Gemeinschaftspraxis für Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Eckernförde, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bens', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.\nInstitute of Human Genetics, Ulm University and Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hiort', 'firstname': 'Olaf', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, University Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Werner', 'firstname': 'Ralf', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, University Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzalves', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Diakonissen-Stiftungs-Krankenhaus, Speyer, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Eckstein', 'firstname': 'Anne Katrin', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Gemeinschaftspraxis für Kinderchirurgie, Kronshagen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Cools', 'firstname': 'Martine', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Verrijn-Stuart', 'firstname': 'Annemarie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Stunnenberg', 'firstname': 'Hendrik G', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Siebert', 'firstname': 'Reiner', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.\nInstitute of Human Genetics, Ulm University and Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ammerpohl', 'firstname': 'Ole', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.\nInstitute of Human Genetics, Ulm University and Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Holterhus', 'firstname': 'Paul-Martin', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.'}]",,,Fifty-seven percent of individuals with AIS type II (n = 8) showed a reduced AR mRNA expression in their GFs.

20375269",Sex-specific impact of prenatal androgens on social brain default mode subsystems.,"Early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism) affect males more frequently than females. Androgens may play a role in this male-bias by sex-differentially impacting early prenatal brain development, particularly neural circuits that later develop specialized roles in social cognition. Here, we find that increasing prenatal testosterone in humans is associated with later reduction of functional connectivity between social brain default mode (DMN) subsystems in adolescent males, but has no effect in females. Since testosterone can work directly via the androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly via the estrogen receptor through aromatase conversion to estradiol, we further examined how a potent non-aromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), acts via the AR to influence gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC)-particularly for genes of high-relevance for DMN circuitry. DHT dysregulates a number of genes enriched for syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability and for genes that in later development are expressed in anatomical patterns that highly correspond to the cortical midline DMN subsystem. DMN-related and DHT-affected genes (e.g., MEF2C) are involved in a number of synaptic processes, many of which impact excitation-inhibition balance. Androgens have male-specific prenatal influence over social brain circuitry in humans and may be relevant towards explaining some component of male-bias in early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions.",[],Molecular psychiatry,2018-08-15,"[{'lastname': 'Lombardo', 'firstname': 'Michael V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Center for Applied Neuroscience, Department of Psychology, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus. mvlombardo@gmail.com.\nAutism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom. mvlombardo@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Auyeung', 'firstname': 'Bonnie', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Pramparo', 'firstname': 'Tiziano', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Quartier', 'firstname': 'Angélique', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France.\nUniversité de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Courraud', 'firstname': 'Jérémie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France.\nUniversité de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Holt', 'firstname': 'Rosemary J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Waldman', 'firstname': 'Jack', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruigrok', 'firstname': 'Amber N V', 'initials': 'ANV', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Mooney', 'firstname': 'Natasha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Bethlehem', 'firstname': 'Richard A I', 'initials': 'RAI', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Meng-Chuan', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.\nChild and Youth Mental Health Collaborative, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and the Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kundu', 'firstname': 'Prantik', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Section on Advanced Functional Neuroimaging, Departments of Radiology & Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bullmore', 'firstname': 'Edward T', 'initials': 'ET', 'affiliation': 'Brain Mapping Unit, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.\nCambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom.\nImmunoPsychiatry, GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Stevenage, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Mandel', 'firstname': 'Jean-Louis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France.\nUniversité de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.\nChair of Human Genetics, Collège de France, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Piton', 'firstname': 'Amélie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France.\nUniversité de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Baron-Cohen', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.\nCambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}]",,,,,10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddf61540>,,,,,,

25496755",Cognitive function in children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.,"Studies of cognitive function in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are few and controversial. This study aimed to investigate general intelligence and specific cognitive functions in children with salt wasting (SW) form of CAH and their relationship to demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. This study included 36 children with classic 21 hydroxylase deficiency SW type of CAH (males = 12; females = 24; mean age = 15.6 ± 2.3 years). Intelligence quotient (IQ) and cognition were assessed using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 3rd edition (WISC-III) and Stanford Binet Subsets Test version 4 (SBST4). Compared to controls, patients had lower mean full-scale (FS) IQ (P = 0.01) score, particularly performance IQ score (P = 0.001), and comprehension, pattern analysis, quantitation, bead memory, and memory for sentences of SBST4 (P = 0.05, P = 0.014, P = 0.001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.05, respectively). Lower IQ was observed in poorly controlled compared with well-controlled patients on medical treatment. Significant correlations were observed between FSIQ with age (r = - 0.810; P = 0.001), duration of treatment (r = - 0.887; P = 0.01), dose of glucocorticoids (r = - 0.463; P = 0.01), 17-OHP (r = - 0.543; P = 0.01) and testosterone (r = - 0.462; P = - 0.006) levels, and number of hyponatremic episodes (r = - 0.350; P = 0.05). In multivariate analysis, the independent risks of low FSIQ were the dose of glucocorticoids (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.08-1.23, P = 0.0001), 17-OHP levels (OR = 2.25; 95% CI = 1.19-2.85, P = 0.01), and number of hyponatremic episodes (OR = 4.34; 95% CI = 2.05-5.15, P = 0.01).Conclusion: Patients with SW form of CAH may have lower IQ and cognitive deficits which may be related to the dose of glucocorticoids, androgen excess, and number of hyponatremic episodes. What is Known: • Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited impairment of cortisol biosynthesis. • Studies of cognitive function in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are few and controversial. What is New: • Children with CAH may have lower intelligent quotient (IQ) and cognitive deficits. • Early hyponatremic episodes, overtreatment with glucocorticoids, and high androgen levels may be possible causative factors for the cognitive deficits.","['Cognition', 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Memory', 'Testosterone']",European journal of pediatrics,2018-08-09,"[{'lastname': 'Hamed', 'firstname': 'Sherifa Ahmed', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Metwalley', 'firstname': 'Kotb Abbass', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, B.O. 71111, Assiut, Egypt. kotb72@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Farghaly', 'firstname': 'Hekma Saad', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, B.O. 71111, Assiut, Egypt.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s00431-018-3226-7,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddf0f9a0>,,,,,,

7492257",What has sex got to do with it? The role of hormones in the transgender brain.,"Sex differences and hormonal effects in presumed cisgender individuals have been well-studied and support the concept of a mosaic of both male and female ""characteristics"" in any given brain. Gonadal steroid increases and fluctuations during peri-puberty and across the reproductive lifespan influence the brain structure and function programmed by testosterone and estradiol exposures in utero. While it is becoming increasingly common for transgender and gender non-binary individuals to block their transition to puberty and/or use gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) to obtain their desired gender phenotype, little is known about the impact of these manipulations on brain structure and function. Using sex differences and the effects of reproductive hormones in cisgender individuals as the backdrop, we summarize here the existing nascent neuroimaging and behavioral literature focusing on potential brain and cognitive differences in transgender individuals at baseline and after GAHT.

Estimating cardiometabolic risk accurately and expediently is challenging, and no single biomarker is satisfactory; hence, we investigated the potential of serum activin A for this purpose. Study data were collected from 433 community-dwelling adults age ≥53 years from Yilan County, Taiwan. Data included: demographics and medical history; physical measurements (blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference); comprehensive functional assessments (frailty, cognitive function, depressive symptoms, nutritional status); fasting blood biochemistry (glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor-1, activin A, stratified into high, medium and low tertiles, and others); and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Metabolic syndrome was considered a proxy for overall cardiometabolic risk. Subjects mean age was 69.3 ± 9.2 years, 48.3% were males. Compared to women, men had higher systolic blood pressure, education levels, relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass, waist circumference, physical activity, walking speed, free androgen index, and levels of serum uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. High activin A was significantly associated with age, relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass in both gender, waist circumference in women, current alcohol drinking, hypertension, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. There were dose-dependent relationships (low to high) between serum activin A and frailty, cognitive impairment, malnutrition, metabolic syndrome, uric acid, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Logistic regression analyses showed older age, serum uric acid, and metabolic syndrome were significantly associated with medium and high activin-A status, whereas, skeletal muscle mass, insulin-like growth factor-1 and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate were associated with high, but not medium, serum activin A. This discovery of a dose-dependent association between serum activin A levels, age, and metabolic syndrome, suggests activin A may be a biomarker of overall cardiometabolic risk; however, further studies are needed to evaluate its potential applications in assessing and managing cardiometabolic risk.","['Activin A', 'Aging', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Diabetes', 'Metabolic syndrome']",Experimental gerontology,2018-08-03,"[{'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Li-Ning', 'initials': 'LN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, National Yang Ming University School of Medicine, 115, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Aging and Health Research Center, National Yang Ming University, 155, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, 201, Sec. 2, Shih-Pai Rd., Taipei 11217, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chou', 'firstname': 'Ming-Yueh', 'initials': 'MY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, National Yang Ming University School of Medicine, 115, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Aging and Health Research Center, National Yang Ming University, 155, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, 386 Ta-Chun 1st Rd., Kaohsiung 81362, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Chih-Kuang', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, National Yang Ming University School of Medicine, 115, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Aging and Health Research Center, National Yang Ming University, 155, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, 386 Ta-Chun 1st Rd., Kaohsiung 81362, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Wei-Ju', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, National Yang Ming University School of Medicine, 115, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Aging and Health Research Center, National Yang Ming University, 155, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Department of Family Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital Yuanshan Branch, 386 Rongguang Rd., Yuanshan Township, YiLan County 264, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kojima', 'firstname': 'Taro', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, Graduate Institute of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Jongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Ming-Hsien', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, National Yang Ming University School of Medicine, 115, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Aging and Health Research Center, National Yang Ming University, 155, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, 201, Sec. 2, Shih-Pai Rd., Taipei 11217, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Loh', 'firstname': 'Ching-Hui', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, National Yang Ming University School of Medicine, 115, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Aging and Health Research Center, National Yang Ming University, 155, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Center for Aging and Health, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, 707, Sec. 3, Chung Yang Rd., Hualien 970, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Liang-Kung', 'initials': 'LK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, National Yang Ming University School of Medicine, 115, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Aging and Health Research Center, National Yang Ming University, 155, Sec. 2, Linong St., Taipei 11221, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, 201, Sec. 2, Shih-Pai Rd., Taipei 11217, Taiwan.

25246292","Salivary testosterone in relation to social cognition and social anxiety in children and adolescents with 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome).","Approximately 1 in 650 boys are born with an extra X chromosome. Boys and men with 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and specific cognitive impairments. This study was focused on social anxiety and social cognition. The aim was to assess if these aspects of the phenotype are related to testosterone deficiency, which is typically seen in 47,XXY from puberty onwards.
In the study 20 boys with 47,XXY and 25 non-clinical controls between 8 and 19 years participated. None had ever used testosterone supplements. Cognitive tests measuring the labeling of facial expressions and perspective taking (Theory of Mind) were administered. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess social anxiety. Testosterone was measured in saliva.
Within the 47,XXY group lower levels of salivary testosterone were significantly associated with higher levels of social anxiety. The correlation was strong, andindependent of age and pubertal development. However, salivary levels of testosterone were uncorrelated to social cognitive skills.
These findings point out that lower testosterone levels might contribute to high social anxiety in 47,XXY, suggesting that anxiety should be monitored in pubertal boys with XXY presenting with testosterone deficiency. This should be done in addition to exploring cognitive behavioral therapy or psychopharmacologic treatments targeting anxiety, which are more evidence based. In contrast, testosterone levels were not associated with social cognitive functioning, suggesting that other mechanisms are driving vulnerabilities in this domain.",[],PloS one,2018-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'van Rijn', 'firstname': 'Sophie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Leiden University, Clinical Child and Adolescent Studies, Leiden, The Netherlands.\nLeiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}]",,,"Within the 47,XXY group lower levels of salivary testosterone were significantly associated with higher levels of social anxiety.

334,30017800,Testosterone treatment in older men: clinical implications and unresolved questions from the Testosterone Trials.,"A decrease in the concentration of circulating testosterone in many older men is a biomarker and possibly a rectifiable contributing factor to ill health. Low circulating testosterone concentration has been associated with cardiovascular disease, reduced cognition, fracture risk, and anaemia. However, randomised placebo-controlled trials are essential to clarify the benefits and possible risks of testosterone treatment in men without hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular disease. The Testosterone Trials (T-Trials) were a coordinated set of trials that, following a screening-to-enrolment ratio of 65:1, randomly assigned 790 men aged 65 years or older who had a baseline testosterone concentration of less than 9·54 nmol/L and symptoms consistent with hypogonadism, but no recognisable hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis pathology, to daily transdermal testosterone or placebo for 12 months. In the main trial, testosterone treatment resulted in a modest benefit for sexual function, whereas the other primary outcomes of vitality and physical function were not met. Data from concomitant substudies raised a possible concern over changes in coronary plaque volume, showed a neutral effect on memory and other cognitive functions, and revealed improvements in volumetric bone mineral density and anaemia. Although insufficient to alter the existing clinical equipoise, the T-Trials provided substantial new data on organ-specific outcomes for testosterone treatment in older men. Further clinical trials are necessary to determine whether testosterone treatment will translate into patient-valued health outcomes and to clarify effects on the cardiovascular system.",[],The lancet.

337,29894840,Slow-wave sleep and androgens: selective slow-wave sleep suppression affects testosterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone secretion.,"Levels of steroid hormones such as androgens and cortisol exhibit circadian variation, and their fluctuations are related to the sleep-wake cycle. Currently, the functional role of different stages of sleep in steroid hormone secretion remains unclear. The present study aims to explore the effect of slow-wave sleep (SWS) suppression on morning levels of cortisol and androgens.
Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in two experimental sessions: a session with selective SWS suppression during night sleep and a session with regular night sleep (control). SWS suppression was achieved by stimulation using an acoustic tone. Salivary samples were collected in the morning immediately after awakening and again 40 min later. The samples were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for testosterone, androstenedione (Ad), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), and cortisol.
SWS suppression reduced overall SWS duration by 54.2% without significant changes in total sleep time and sleep efficiency. In the session with selective SWS suppression, the average level of morning testosterone was lower than in the control session (p = 0.017). Likewise, 17-OHP was lower in the SWS suppression condition (p = 0.011) whereas the ratio of DHEA/Ad was higher (p = 0.025). There were no significant differences between sessions in cortisol, Ad, or DHEA concentrations.
The effect of selective SWS suppression on morning levels of testosterone and 17-OHP points to the importance of SWS for the synthesis and secretion of androgens. These results suggest that chronic sleep problems, which lead to reduced SWS, increase the risk for the development of androgen deficiency in the long term.","['17α-hydroxyprogesterone', 'Androstenedione', 'Cortisol', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone', 'Slow-wave sleep', 'Testosterone']",Sleep medicine,2018-06-13,"[{'lastname': 'Ukraintseva', 'firstname': 'Yu V', 'initials': 'YV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Butlerova St. 5A, 117485, Moscow, Russia; ITMO University, Kronverksky Pr. 49, 197101, Saint Petersburg, Russia.

338,29884451,Cognitive abilities in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and women with gonadal dysgenesis.,"Many questions regarding the mechanisms behind sex differences in cognitive abilities are still unanswered. On a group level, men typically outperform women on certain spatial tasks, whereas women perform better on certain tests of memory and verbal ability. The prevailing theories concerning the biological predispositions for these and other differences in behaviour and brain function focus on early and prolonged exposure to sex hormones. There is, however, evidence of direct effects of sex chromosomes on sex-typical behaviour in other species.
To study the influence of sex hormones and sex chromosomes on cognition in women with Complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) and Gonadal dysgenesis (GD).
Eighteen women with CAIS, 6 women with 46,XYGD, and 7 women with 46,XXGD were compared with age-matched male and female controls on tests of spatial and verbal abilities, memory functions, and emotion recognition.
Women with CAIS, XYGD, and XXGD performed similar to female controls on cognitive tasks. However, on a test of emotion recognition, women with XXGD outperformed the other groups, whereas women with CAIS and XYGD performed similar to male controls.
Our results support theories of androgen effects on cognitive abilities and suggest that factors related to sex chromosomes may influence emotion recognition.

25465747",Impact of gender and genetics on emotion processing in Parkinson's disease - A multimodal study.,"•Understanding of the phenotypic heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease is needed.•Gender and genetics determine manifestation and progression of Parkinson's disease.•Altered emotion processing in Parkinson's disease is specific to male patients.•This is influenced by endocrinal and genetic factors in both genders.•This finding may impact the diagnosis and treatment of emerging clinical features.
Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested to affect males and females differently. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and disabling in PD. However, previous studies focusing on emotion recognition in PD have neglected the confounder of gender and lack evidence on the underlying endocrinal and genetic mechanisms. Moreover, while there are many imaging studies on emotion processing in PD, gender-related analyses of neural data are scarce. We therefore aimed at exploring the interplay of the named factors on emotion recognition and processing in PD.
51 non-demented PD patients (26 male) and 44 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC; 25 male) were examined clinically and neuropsychologically including an emotion recognition task (Ekman 60faces test). A subsample of 25 patients and 31 HC underwent task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) comprised of videos of emotional facial expressions. To examine the impact of hormones and genetics on emotion processing, blood samples were taken for endocrinal (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone) and genetic testing (5-HTTLPR, Val158Met COMT polymorphisms).
No group or gender differences emerged regarding cognitive abilities. Male but not female PD patients exhibited confined impairments in recognizing the emotion anger accompanied by diminished neural response to facial expressions (e.g. in the putamen and insula). Endocrinologically, fear recognition was positively correlated with estrogen levels in female patients, while on the genetic level we found an effect of Val158Met COMT genotype on the recognition of fear in PD patients.
Our study provides evidence that impaired emotion processing in PD specifically affects male patients, and that hormones and genetics contribute to emotion recognition performance. Further research on the underlying neural, endocrinological and genetic mechanisms of specific symptoms in PD is of clinical relevance, as it can improve our understanding of the phenomenology and pathobiology of the disease and may allow a more personalized medicine.","['BAI, Beck anxiety inventory', 'BDI-II, Beck depression inventory version II', 'BFRT, Benton facial recognition test', 'BOLD, blood‑oxygen-level dependent', 'COMT, catechol-O-methyltransferase', 'EPI, echo planar imaging', 'Emotion', 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)', 'GM, gray matter', 'Gender', 'Genetics', 'H&Y, Hoehn and Yahr rating scale', 'HC, healthy controls', 'LEDD, levodopa equivalence daily dose', 'MCI, mild cognitive impairment', 'MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination', 'MRI, magnetic resonance imaging', 'MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment', 'NMS, non-motor symptoms', ""PD, Parkinson's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease (PD)"", ""UPDRS, Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale"", 'VBM, voxel-based morphometry', 'fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging']",NeuroImage.

340,29752975,"Changes in mood, fatigue, sleep, cognitive performance and stress hormones among instructors conducting stressful military captivity survival training.","Numerous studies have examined the effects of captivity survival training on psychological and physiological function in trainees. In the present study we shifted the focus to instructors, and measured the effects that the delivery of training exerts on their levels of stress and performance. Because instructors are called upon to perform difficult duties (e.g., mock interrogations) under extreme conditions, we hypothesized that significant increases in psychological and physiological indices of stress would occur due to training. In addition, as part of their job tasking, the instructors conducted courses in consecutive weeks. This offered a unique and ecologically valid opportunity to assess carryover of stress from one week to the next. We hypothesized stress levels would be higher in the second than the first week of training. Our first hypothesis was supported: Delivering training was associated with impairments in mood, fatigue, and sleep, as well as a reduction in the ratio of testosterone/cortisol level in blood. Our second hypothesis was largely not supported as a 3-day break separating consecutive courses appeared sufficient for restoring psychological and physiological function. Our results demonstrate that although the delivery of training exerts negative effects on instructors' levels of stress, the 3-day recovery period separating consecutive courses is sufficient to return psychological and physiological function to baseline levels.","['Fatigue', 'Memory', 'Military', 'Mood', 'Testosterone/cortisol']",Physiology & behavior,2018-05-13,"[{'lastname': 'Vartanian', 'firstname': 'Oshin', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Defence Research and Development Canada, Toronto Research Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

341,29702443,Immediate and delayed neuroendocrine responses to social exclusion in males and females.,"Social exclusion is a complex phenomenon, with wide-ranging immediate and delayed effects on well-being, hormone levels, brain activation and motivational behavior. Building upon previous work, the current fMRI study investigated affective, endocrine and neural responses to social exclusion in a more naturalistic Cyberball task in 40 males and 40 females. As expected, social exclusion elicited well-documented affective and neural responses, i.e., increased anger and distress, as well as increased exclusion-related activation of the anterior insula, the posterior-medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Cortisol and testosterone decreased over the course of the experiment, whereas progesterone showed no changes. Hormone levels were not correlated with subjective affect, but they were related to exclusion-induced neural responses. Exclusion-related activation in frontal areas was associated with decreases in cortisol and increases in testosterone until recovery. Given that results were largely independent of sex, the current findings have important implications regarding between-sex vs. within-sex variations and the conceptualization of state vs. trait neuroendocrine functions in social neuroscience.","['Cortisol', 'Cyberball', 'Progesterone', 'Social exclusion', 'Testosterone', 'fMRI']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2018-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Radke', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr. 30, 52074 Aachen, Germany; Jülich Aachen Research Alliance (JARA) - BRAIN Institute 1, Brain Structure-Function Relationships: Decoding the Human Brain at Systemic Levels, Pauwelsstr. 30, 52074 Aachen, Germany.

12476433",Changes in cerebral metabolic activity in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a common treatment option for men with biochemical relapse from prostate cancer. ADT is associated with changes in mood, cognition, and quality of life, and most recently with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examined changes in brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) in men undergoing intermittent ADT.
Nine men with prostate cancer and a rising PSA (biochemical recurrence) without evidence of metastases were treated with intermittent ADT consisting of 9 months of complete androgen blockade achieved with combined leuprolide acetate and flutamide. Patients underwent resting [Fuorine-18] fluorodeoxyglucose PET (
Whole-brain mapping analysis after 9 months of androgen deprivation compared to pretreatment baseline revealed decreased regional cerebral glucose metabolism in the cerebellum, posterior cingulate, and medial thalamus bilaterally. Associations of brain metabolism with measurements of cognition and mood while on androgen deprivation revealed positive correlations between the posterior cingulate, left inferior parietal lobule (BA40), and left mid temporal gyrus (BA39) and spatial reasoning and a negative correlation between left inferior parietal lobule and verbal memory. Several mood indices were negatively correlated with hypothalamus and brainstem.
These findings suggest that complete androgen deprivation may result in changes in regional brain metabolism associated with variation in mood, verbal memory, and spatial performance.

23149223",Neural correlates of emotional action control in anger-prone women with borderline personality disorder.,"Difficulty in controlling emotional impulses is a crucial component of borderline personality disorder (BPD) that often leads to destructive, impulsive behaviours against others. In line with recent findings in aggressive individuals, deficits in prefrontal amygdala coupling during emotional action control may account for these symptoms.
To study the neurobiological correlates of altered emotional action control in individuals with BPD, we asked medication-free, anger-prone, female patients with BPD and age- and intelligence-matched healthy women to take part in an approach-avoidance task while lying in an MRI scanner. The task required controlling fast behavioural tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Additionally, before the task we collected saliva testosterone and self-reported information on tendencies to act out anger and correlated this with behavioural and functional MRI (fMRI) data.
We included 30 patients and 28 controls in our analysis. Patients with BPD reported increased tendencies to act out anger and were faster in approaching than avoiding angry faces than with healthy women, suggesting deficits in emotional action control in women with BPD. On a neural level, controlling fast emotional action tendencies was associated with enhanced activation in the antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex across groups. Healthy women showed a negative coupling between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right amygdala, whereas this was absent in patients with BPD.
Specificity of results to BPD and sex differences remain unknown owing to the lack of clinical control groups and male participants.
The results indicate reduced lateral prefrontal-amygdala communication during emotional action control in anger-prone women with BPD. The findings provide a possible neural mechanism underlying difficulties with controlling emotional impulses in patients with BPD.",[],Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN,2018-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Bertsch', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'From the Department of General Psychiatry, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany (Bertsch, Herpertz);

345,29683499,The role of androgens on periodontal repair in female rats.,"Testosterone replacement enhances cognitive function and musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women. However, the biological role of testosterone on inflammation and bone metabolism in females is not well understood. Our objective was to measure the impact of androgens and their receptors on periodontal tissues during periodontal repair in female rats.
Seventy female Holtzman rats were divided into seven groups (n = 10/group): negative control; repair control; androgen receptor antagonist (flutamide, 50 mg/kg, every other day); estrogen receptor antagonist (fulvestrant, 1.5 mg/kg/day); testosterone supplementation (durateston, 250 mg/kg, weekly); aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, 0.2 mg /kg/day); testosterone plus anastrozole. Cotton ligatures were kept for 13 days, when pharmacological treatment was initiated. On day 14, the ligatures were removed. The rats were euthanized on the 17
Blockage of androgen receptors had little effect on inflammatory cell count, although it tended to increase interleukin (IL)-4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as decrease IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6. Flutamide also significantly impaired bone repair (P < 0.05) and had greater osteoclast count, although this last difference was not statistically significant. Testosterone supplementation significantly increased the inflammatory cell count, decreased the levels of IL-4, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α; and increased VEGF and EGF.

346,29680294,Klinefelter Syndrome. The Effects of Early Androgen Therapy on Competence and Behavioral Phenotype.,"Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the result of sex chromosome aneuploidy most often characterized as 47,XXY. The typical features of KS include tall stature, gynecomastia, small firm testicles, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and infertility. However, abnormalities in neurodevelopment, cognition, and social and behavioral functioning also can be present. The abnormalities in neurodevelopment are believed to be due in part to androgen deficiency during early development and puberty.
To discuss the role of androgens in normal adolescent development; discuss the cognitive, behavioral, and social functioning of children with KS; evaluate the evidence for early androgen therapy in men with KS; and discuss management strategies in the development of boys with KS.
A systematic review of early androgen therapy and KS was performed using PubMed-Medline and Scopus databases. Relevant articles commenting on social, behavioral, cognitive, and physical outcomes among infants, children, and adolescents were included for reporting and discussion.
Social and behavior functioning; cognitive outcomes; adverse effects associated with androgen therapy.
3 retrospective articles and 2 randomized controlled trials addressing early androgen therapy in boys with KS were reviewed. These studies showed an improvement in several aspects of social and cognitive functioning based on validated questionnaires. Treatment strategies, potential negative effects, and limitations of the literature on early androgen therapy in boys with KS are discussed.
Our findings indicate that early androgen supplementation in children with KS combined with specific educational, family, and social support improves behavioral functioning. The optimal timing of hormonal therapy might require prospective studies, but based on our data and review of the literature, the benefit of early hormonal and therapeutic intervention in KS is very encouraging.

348,29625804,[Use of the 2D:4D digit ratio as a biological marker of specific language disorders].,"The finding of biological markers of specific language impairment would facilitate their detection and early intervention. In this sense, the 2D:4D finger ratio is considered an indirect indicator of prenatal exposure to testosterone. Previous studies have related it to linguistic competence and aggressive behaviour, and could be a candidate for a biological marker of language impairment. The aim was to compare the value of the 2D:4D ratio in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) with those of children with typical language development, as well as to establish to what extent this biological index correlates with the behaviour (linguistic, cognitive, social,...) in both groups.
2D:4D ratio, language, cognition and social behaviour were compared in a group of children with SLI (n=15), with a group of children without language difficulties (n=16) of the same age (between 5-8 years), gender (male), and socio-cultural level.
Children with SLI showed significantly higher values of 2D:4D ratio of the right hand, and a negative correlation between this ratio and their linguistic competence. Although the children with SLI showed impaired adaptive abilities, but not more aggressive behaviour, these measurements did not correlate with the 2D:4D index. Nevertheless, social behaviour correlated with language and cognition competence.
A higher value of the biological 2D:4D ration (lower intrauterine exposure to testosterone) seems to be associated with language difficulties in boys with SLI, but not with their behavioural difficulties. Their behavioural difficulties seem to be a consequence of their linguistic difficulties and their level of cognition.","['Adaptive behaviour', 'Ajuste social', 'Androgen exposure', 'Androgenización', 'Biomarcador', 'Biomarker', 'Conducta adaptativa', 'Developmental language disorders', 'Social adjustment', 'Testosterona', 'Testosterone', 'Trastornos del desarrollo del lenguaje']",Anales de pediatria,2018-04-08,"[{'lastname': 'Font-Jordà', 'firstname': 'Antònia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Gamundí', 'firstname': 'Antoni', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Nicolau Llobera', 'firstname': 'María Cristina', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Aguilar-Mediavilla', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, España.

25929443",Interactive effects of testosterone and cortisol on hippocampal volume and episodic memory in middle-aged men.,"Animal and human research suggests that testosterone is associated with hippocampal structure and function. Studies examining the association between testosterone and either hippocampal structure or hippocampal-mediated cognitive processes have overwhelmingly focused on the effects of testosterone alone, without considering the interaction of other neuroendocrine factors. The aim of the present study was to examine the interactive effects of testosterone and cortisol in relation to hippocampal volume and episodic memory in a sample of late-middle aged men from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. The average age of participants was 56.3 years (range 51-60). Salivary hormone samples were collected at multiple time-points on two non-consecutive at-home days, and an in-lab assessment. Area under the curve with respect to ground measures for cortisol and testosterone were utilized. Significant testosterone-by-cortisol interactions were observed for hippocampal volume, and episodic memory. When cortisol levels were elevated (1 SD above the mean), testosterone levels were positively associated with hippocampal volume and memory performance. However, when cortisol levels were low (1 SD below the mean), testosterone levels were inversely related to hippocampal volume and memory performance. These findings suggest that in context of high cortisol levels, testosterone may be neuroprotective. In contrast, low testosterone may also be neuroprotective in the context of low cortisol levels.

350,29547741,"Unraveling age, puberty and testosterone effects on subcortical brain development across adolescence.","The onset of adolescence in humans is marked by hormonal changes that give rise to secondary sexual characteristics, noted as puberty. It has, however, proven challenging to unravel to what extent pubertal changes may have organizing effects on the brain beyond chronological age, as reported in animal studies. The present longitudinal study aimed to characterize the unique effects of age and puberty on subcortical brain volumes and included three waves of data collection at two-year intervals and 680 T1-weighted MRI scans of 271 participants (54% females) aged between 8 and 29 years old. Generalized additive mixed model procedures were used to assess the effects of age, self-report pubertal status and testosterone level on basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum gray matter volumes. We observed age-related increases in putamen and pallidum volumes, and decreases in accumbens and thalamus volumes, all show larger volumes in boys than girls. Only the cerebellum showed an interaction effect of age by sex, such that males showed prolonged increases in cerebellar volume than females. Next, we showed that changes in self-report puberty status better described developmental change than chronological age for most structures in males, and for caudate, pallidum and hippocampal volumes in females. Furthermore, changes in testosterone level were related to development of pallidum, accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala volumes in males and caudate and hippocampal volumes in females. The modeling approach of the present study allowed us to characterize the complex interactions between chronological age and pubertal maturational changes, and the findings indicate puberty unique changes in brain structure that are sex specific.","['Adolescence', 'Hormones', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Puberty', 'Subcortical structures', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2018-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Wierenga', 'firstname': 'Lara M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, PO Box 9600, 2300 RB Leiden, The Netherlands; Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, The Netherlands.

351,29529521,Prenatal dexamethasone treatment in the context of at risk CAH pregnancies: Long-term behavioral and cognitive outcome.,"Dexamethasone (DEX) is used to prevent prenatal virilization in female fetuses with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Since treatment has to be started before the genotype of the fetus is known, 7 out of 8 fetuses will be exposed to DEX without benefit. Previously, we have observed negative effects on cognition and behavior in DEX treated children. Here we evaluated neuropsychological functions, psychopathology and autistic traits in non-CAH DEX-treated adults exposed during the first trimester of fetal life (duration 6.2 ± 2.2 weeks). Cognitive functions, psychopathology and autistic traits were compared between DEX-treated subjects (n = 23) and non-exposed controls (n = 58). Cognitive outcome was also evaluated longitudinally for DEX-treated participants. We used neuropsychological tests (Wechsler Scales and the Stroop Interference Test) and questionnaires assessing executive functions (the Barkley Deficit in Executive Functioning Scale), psychopathology (the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Ratings Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and autistic traits (Autism Quota). We did not observe any significant differences in cognition, psychopathology or autistic traits between DEX-treated individuals and population controls. A significant improvement in verbal working memory (p = 0.038) and in impulse inhibition (p = 0.011) was seen when subjects were evaluated longitudinally. In summary, first-trimester DEX-exposed adult individuals do not show any significant neuropsychological deficits nor an increase in anxiety, depression or autistic traits, compared with a control group from the general population. The results also suggest that the observed deficits in executive functioning during childhood may improve with time.","['Cognitive functions', 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia', 'Dexamethasone', 'Neuropsychological assessment', 'Prenatal treatment', 'Social functioning']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2018-03-13,"[{'lastname': 'Karlsson', 'firstname': 'Leif', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit (Q2:08), Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Nordenström', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit (Q2:08), Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Hirvikoski', 'firstname': 'Tatja', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Neuropsychiatry Unit, Center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND), Karolinska Institutet, SE-113 30 Stockholm, Sweden; Habilitation and Health, Stockholm County Council, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Lajic', 'firstname': 'Svetlana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit (Q2:08), Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.

352,29522764,Does the use of hormonal contraceptives affect the mental rotation performance?,"Oral contraceptive pill (OC) is one of the most popular form of contraception. Despite both behavioral and neuroimaging evidence of its significant impact on female brain and cognitive functions, much remains to be discovered regarding OCs targets in the brain and mechanisms of action. In the present study mental rotation performance was compared between women using anti-androgenic oral contraceptives (n = 35), naturally cycling (NC) women (n = 33) and men (n = 29). On average, OC users were less accurate than NC women and men. Men performed the task more accurately than NC women, but the difference reached significance only in the highest angular disparity condition (150 deg). The response time was positively related with progesterone level while accuracy was negatively related with 17ß-estradiol level, in NC, but not OC women. The comparison of slope and intercept values (parameters relating response time to angular disparity) revealed the main result of present study: OC users exhibited significantly lower slope compared to men and NC women, but there were no differences in intercept between groups. These results suggest that OC users instead of using rotation in mind strategy implemented some alternative method(s). We conclude that lower performance accuracy of OC users could be related to a less efficient performance strategy.","['Estradiol', 'Mental rotation', 'Oral contraceptives', 'Progesterone', 'Progestins']",Hormones and behavior,2018-03-10,"[{'lastname': 'Griksiene', 'firstname': 'Ramune', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biosciences, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.

24445948",Lessons From the Testosterone Trials.,"The Testosterone Trials (TTrials) were a coordinated set of seven placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in 788 men with a mean age of 72 years to determine the efficacy of increasing the testosterone levels of older men with low testosterone. Testosterone treatment increased the median testosterone level from unequivocally low at baseline to midnormal for young men after 3 months and maintained that level until month 12. In the Sexual Function Trial, testosterone increased sexual activity, sexual desire, and erectile function. In the Physical Function Trial, testosterone did not increase the distance walked in 6 minutes in men whose walk speed was slow; however, in all TTrial participants, testosterone did increase the distance walked. In the Vitality Trial, testosterone did not increase energy but slightly improved mood and depressive symptoms. In the Cognitive Function Trial, testosterone did not improve cognitive function. In the Anemia Trial, testosterone increased hemoglobin in both men who had anemia of a known cause and in men with unexplained anemia. In the Bone Trial, testosterone increased volumetric bone mineral density and the estimated strength of the spine and hip. In the Cardiovascular Trial, testosterone increased the coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume as assessed using computed tomographic angiography. Although testosterone was not associated with more cardiovascular or prostate adverse events than placebo, a trial of a much larger number of men for a much longer period would be necessary to determine whether testosterone increases cardiovascular or prostate risk.",[],Endocrine reviews,2018-03-10,"[{'lastname': 'Snyder', 'firstname': 'Peter J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Division

354,29482135,Single dose testosterone administration modulates emotional reactivity and counterfactual choice in healthy males.,"Testosterone has been implicated in the regulation of emotional responses and risky decision-making. However, the causal effect of testosterone upon emotional decision-making, especially in non-social settings, is still unclear. The present study investigated the role of testosterone in counterfactual thinking: regret is an intense negative emotion that arises from comparison of an obtained outcome from a decision against a better, non-obtained (i.e. counterfactual) alternative. Healthy male participants (n = 64) received a single-dose of 150 mg testosterone Androgel in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-participants design. At 180 min post-administration, participants performed the counterfactual thinking task. We applied a computational model derived from behavioral economic principles to uncover latent decision-making mechanisms that may be invisible in simple choice analyses. Our data showed that testosterone increased the ability to use anticipated regret to guide choice behavior, while reducing choice based on expected value. On affective ratings, testosterone increased sensitivity to both obtained and counterfactual outcomes. These findings provide evidence that testosterone causally modulates emotional decision-making, and highlight the role of testosterone in affective sensitivity.","['Dual process', 'Emotion', 'Human male', 'Regret', 'Reward', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2018-02-27,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Brain Function and Psychological Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Affective and Social Cognitive Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

355,29477720,Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Self-Reported Cognitive Function in Men with Prostate Cancer.,"Although androgen deprivation therapy is widely used to treat prostate cancer, its effects on cognitive function are unclear. To our knowledge no prior report has examined the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on self-reported cognitive function.
Three groups of men 50 years old or older who were matched on age and education were enrolled in the study, including 81 with prostate cancer starting on continuous androgen deprivation therapy, 84 controls with prostate cancer not receiving androgen deprivation therapy and 85 healthy controls. Two scales from the FACT-Cog (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive subscale) version 3 were used to assess self-reported cognitive function. Changes in cognitive scores with time were analyzed by 2 approaches, including 1) multivariable regression and 2) calculation of the proportion of subjects per group with a decrease of 1 SD or more. Multivariable regression was applied to assess predictors of a decline in self-reported cognitive function. We also examined relationships between the FACT-Cog and a neuropsychological battery of 15 tests.
Mean participant age was 69 years (range 50 to 87). The mean educational level was 15 years (range 8 to 24). FACT-Cog scores were similar at baseline across the cohorts. Neither analytical approach revealed that androgen deprivation therapy was associated with changes in self-reported cognitive function on either FACT-Cog scale. Mood and fatigue correlated with changes in self-reported cognitive function. The relationship between self-reported and objective cognitive measures was weak (maximum Spearman correlation coefficient 0.14) and only 2 of 30 correlations were statistically significant.
A total of 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy were not associated with self-reported cognitive function changes in older men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.","['androgen antagonists', 'cognitive dysfunction', 'prostatic neoplasms', 'quality of life', 'surveys and questionnaires']",The Journal of urology,2018-02-27,"[{'lastname': 'Marzouk', 'firstname': 'Shireen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Naglie', 'firstname': 'Gary', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomlinson', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Duff Canning', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Neurosciences Program, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Breunis', 'firstname': 'Henriette', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Timilshina', 'firstname': 'Narhari', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Alibhai', 'firstname': 'Shabbir M H', 'initials': 'SMH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

356,29465774,Measuring Resilience to Operational Stress in Canadian Armed Forces Personnel.,"Adaptability to stress is governed by innate resilience, comprised of complex neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms alongside inherited or learned behavioral traits. Based on their capacity to adapt, some people thrive in stressful situations, whereas others experience maladaptation. In our study, we used state-of-the-art tools to assess the resilience level in individuals, as well as their susceptibility to developing military stress-induced behavioral and cognitive deficits. To address this complex question, we tested Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel in three distinct stress environments (baselines): during predeployment training, deployment in Afghanistan, and readjustment upon return to Canada. Our comprehensive outcome measures included psychometric tests, saliva biomarkers, and computerized cognitive tests that used the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. Participants were categorized based on initial biomarker measurements as being at low-, moderate-, or high stress-maladaptation risk. Biomarkers showed significant changes (ds = 0.56 to 2.44) between baselines, calculated as ""delta"" changes. Participants at low stress-maladaptation risk demonstrated minimal changes, whereas those at high stress-maladaptation risk showed significant biomarker variations. The psychometric patterns and cognitive functions were likewise affected across baselines, suggesting that the panel of saliva stress biomarkers could be a useful tool for determining the risk of stress maladaptation that can cause psychological and cognitive decline.",[],Journal of traumatic stress,2018-02-22,"[{'lastname': 'Hellewell', 'firstname': 'Sarah C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': ""Canadian Military and Veterans' Clinical Rehabilitation Research Program, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Cernak', 'firstname': 'Ibolja', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Canadian Military and Veterans' Clinical Rehabilitation Research Program, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.""}]",,,,Copyright © 2018 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.,10.1002/jts.22261,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddbf2a90>,,,,,,

We assessed stability of neurocognitive features across diverse populations and quantified factors mediating outcome. Forty-four boys from the Netherlands (NL) and 54 boys from the United States (US) participated. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales assessed intellectual functioning; the ANT program evaluated cognitive function; and the CBCL assessed behavioral functioning. ANOVA was used for group comparisons. Hierarchical regressions assessed variance explained by each independent variable: parental education, timing of diagnosis, testosterone, age, and nationality. Parental education, timing of diagnosis, and hormonal treatment all played an important role in neurocognitive performance. The observed higher IQ and better attention regulation in the US group as compared to the NL group was observed with decreased levels of behavioral problems in the US group. Cognitive measures that were different between the NL and US groups, i.e., attention regulation and IQ scores, were also significantly influenced by external factors including timing of diagnosis, testosterone treatment, and parental education. On the ANT, a cognitive phenotype of 47,XXY was observed, with similar scores on 9 out of the 10 ANT subtests for the NL and US groups. This study lays additional features to the foundation for an algorithm linking external variables to outcome on various neurodevelopmental measures.","['47,XXY', 'Klinefelter syndrome', 'XXY', 'sex chromosome', 'sex chromosome aneuploidy']",American journal of medical genetics.

29384141",Why is understanding the relationship of testosterone to cardiovascular risk so important?,"Epidemiological studies hint at a beneficial influence of endogenous circulating testosterone (T), or its metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT), such that men with lower concentrations of T or DHT appear to have poorer health outcomes including frailty, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Small interventional studies of T have shown favorable effects on surrogate outcome measures, but a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the prespecified outcome of cardiovascular events has not been performed and would be logistically demanding. In the absence of such a definitive RCT, there is a controversy about the cardiovascular risks of T-therapy fuelled by contradictory findings from retrospective analyses of insurance databases of men prescribed T. The US Testosterone Trials (T-Trials) are the largest published RCTs of T-therapy in older men with symptoms or signs of hypogonadism and circulating T <9.54 nmol l",[],Asian journal of andrology,2018-02-07,"[{'lastname': 'Yeap', 'firstname': 'Bu B', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6009, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth, Western Australia 6150, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Anawalt', 'firstname': 'Bradley D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States.'}]",,,,,10.4103/aja.aja_71_17,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddc0b5e0>,,,,,,

12760514","Gendered Peer Involvement in Girls with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Effects of Prenatal Androgens, Gendered Activities, and Gender Cognitions.","A key question in understanding gender development concerns the origins of sex segregation. Children's tendencies to interact with same-sex others have been hypothesized to result from gender identity and cognitions, behavioral compatibility, and personal characteristics. We examined whether prenatal androgen exposure was related to time spent with boys and girls, and how that gendered peer involvement was related to sex-typed activities and gender identity and cognitions. We studied 54 girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) aged 10-13 years varying in degree of prenatal androgen exposure: 40 girls with classical CAH (C-CAH) exposed to high prenatal androgens and 14 girls with non-classical CAH (NC-CAH) exposed to low, female-typical, prenatal androgens. Home interviews and questionnaires provided assessments of gendered activity interests and participation, gender identity, and gender cognitions. Daily phone calls over 7 days assessed time spent in gendered activities and with peers. Girls with both C-CAH and NC-CAH interacted more with girls than with boys, with no significant group differences. The groups did not differ significantly in gender identity or gender cognitions, but girls with C-CAH spent more time in male-typed activities and less time in female-typed activities than did girls with NC-CAH. Time spent with girls reflected direct effects of gender identity/cognitions and gender-typed activities, and an indirect effect of prenatal androgens (CAH type) through gender-typed activities. Our results extend findings that prenatal androgens differentially affect gendered characteristics and that gendered peer interactions reflect combined effects of behavioral compatibility and feelings and cognitions about gender. The study also shows the value of natural experiments for testing hypotheses about gender development.","['Congenital adrenal hyperplasia', 'Gender cognitions', 'Gender identity', 'Gender-typed activities', 'Prenatal androgens', 'Sex segregation']",Archives of sexual behavior,2018-01-11,"[{'lastname': 'Berenbaum', 'firstname': 'Sheri A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, 453 Moore Building, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. sberenbaum@psu.edu.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA. sberenbaum@psu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Beltz', 'firstname': 'Adriene M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bryk', 'firstname': 'Kristina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, 453 Moore Building, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McHale', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Development and Family Studies, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1007/s10508-017-1112-4

This form of hypogonadism results in decreased testosterone levels and variable gonadotrophin levels. - The symptoms of LOH are often aspecific and may be consistent with ageing in men: lowered libido, loss of strength, reduced cognitive functioning and disorders of sleeping and mood. - There is discussion about testosterone parameters, but if clinical symptoms are consistent with LOH and the testosterone level is < 8 nmol/l, hypogonadism is evidently indicated. - The first step is giving advice on lifestyle and treating comorbidity. In addition, treatment with testosterone may be given. - Testosterone has a positive effect on sexual function and vitality. Testosterone therapy for hypogonadism decreases the risk of osteoporosis. Contraindications are advanced prostate cancer and the desire to have children. - If a patient is treated with testosterone, strict follow-up is recommended; testosterone, haematocrit and PSA levels should be determined at set intervals.",[],Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,2018-01-06,"[{'lastname': 'Maatje', 'firstname': 'M G F', 'initials': 'MGF', 'affiliation': 'HagaZiekenhuis, afd.

26348661",Computerized cognitive training in prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy: a pilot study.,"Prostate cancer patients who have undergone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may experience cognitive impairment, yet there is an unmet need for nonpharmacological interventions to address cognitive impairment in this population. This study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a home-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) program to treat cancer-related cognitive impairment.
Sixty men who had received ≥ 3 months of ADT were screened for at least mild cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment and randomized to 8 weeks of CCT or usual care. Follow-up assessments occurred immediately post-intervention or equivalent (T2) and 8 weeks later (T3). The acceptability of CCT was also assessed.
Feasibility:A priori feasibility thresholds were partially met (i.e., randomization rate > 50%, retention rate > 70% excluding CCT drop-outs, but < 70% for intent-to-treat). Acceptability: Participants were mostly satisfied with CCT and found it somewhat enjoyable, though barriers to uptake existed. Preliminary efficacy: Linear mixed models indicated significant time by group effects favorable to CCT in reaction time (p = .01), but unfavorable to CCT in verbal and visual memory (ps < .05). Memory was temporarily suppressed in the CCT group at T2, but normalized by T3. There was no effect of CCT on self-reported cognitive functioning, neurobehavioral functioning, nor quality of life.
This study provides tentative support for the feasibility and acceptability of CCT to treat mild cognitive impairment in ADT patients. CCT had a beneficial effect on reaction time, but temporarily suppressed memory. CCT's benefits may be limited to a narrow area of functioning. Larger-scale studies are needed.","['Antiandrogens', 'Cancer-related cognitive impairment', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Hormone therapy', 'Oncology']",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2017-12-29,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Lisa M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 633 North St. Clair, 19th floor, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA. lisa.wu1@northwestern.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Amidi', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Unit for Psychooncology and Health Psychology, Department of Oncology and Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences, Aarhus University Hospital and Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanenbaum', 'firstname': 'Molly L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Winkel', 'firstname': 'Gary', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gordon', 'firstname': 'Wayne A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hall', 'firstname': 'Simon J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Urology, Northwell Health, Great Neck, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bovbjerg', 'firstname': 'Katrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 633 North St. Clair, 19th floor, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Diefenbach', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Urology, Northwell Health, Great Neck, NY, USA.'}]",,,"Feasibility:A priori feasibility thresholds were partially met (i.e., randomization rate > 50%, retention rate > 70% excluding CCT drop-outs, but < 70% for intent-to-treat).

Among others, it manifests in loss of control over Internet usage and social problems due to problematic Internet use. Although IUD currently is not an official diagnosis in DSM-5 or ICD-10, mounting evidence suggests that IUD indeed could be categorized as a behavioral addiction. On a systemic neuroscientific level, IUD is well characterized and dysfunctions in the fronto-striatal-limbic loop have been observed in persons being afflicted with IUD.

Other studies have shown that androgens decrease dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell, a region important for decision-making behavior in probability discounting. Thus, we attempted to restore selection of the large/uncertain reward in testosterone-treated rats by administering the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole or the D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 and testing probability discounting.
Adolescent male Long-Evans rats were treated chronically with high-dose testosterone (7.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (13% cyclodextrin in water), and tested for probability discounting after injections of saline, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg of quinpirole or SKF81297. Rats chose between a small/certain reward (1 sugar pellet, 100% probability) and a large/uncertain reward (4 pellets, decreasing probability: 100, 75, 50, 25, 0%).
Testosterone-treated rats selected the large/uncertain reward significantly less than vehicle-treated controls after saline injection. However, acute injection with 0.1 mg/kg quinpirole increased large/uncertain reward preference in testosterone-treated rats only, indicated by a testosterone × quinpirole interaction. At 0.5 mg/kg, quinpirole increased large/uncertain reward preference in all rats. Acute injection with SKF81297 at 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg rescued large/uncertain reward preference in testosterone-treated rats by eliminating the difference between groups.
It appears that altered probability discounting behavior in testosterone-treated rats is due to both decreased D1 and D2 receptor function.","['Anabolic agents', 'Decision making', 'Dopamine', 'Food reward', 'Operant behavior']",Psychopharmacology,2017-12-16,"[{'lastname': 'Wallin-Miller', 'firstname': 'Kathryn G', 'initials': 'KG', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kreutz', 'firstname': 'Frida', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Grace', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Integrated Anatomical Sciences, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, 1333 San Pablo St., BMT 401, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wood', 'firstname': 'Ruth I', 'initials': 'RI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Integrated Anatomical Sciences, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, 1333 San Pablo St., BMT 401, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, USA. riw@usc.edu.'}]",,,"Testosterone-treated rats selected the large/uncertain reward significantly less than vehicle-treated controls after saline injection.

364,29241313,Hormonal treatment and quality of life of prostate cancer patients: new evidence.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment of patients with relapsed or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostatic carcinoma. The dramatic reduction of serum testosterone levels induced by ADT produces multiple side effects as vasomotor flushing, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, impairment of cognitive function, reduced quality of sleep, gynecomastia and anemia, that are able to decrease health-related quality of life (QoL). In addition, hormonal therapy can interfere with bone metabolism and induce metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Recently, new-generation hormonal therapies, such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, have been tested and approved in castration resistant prostatic cancer patients and current studies are moving forward to the earlier use of these two drugs. In this evolving scenario, the management of hormonal therapy toxicity, given the long duration of treatment and the potentially high impact of side effects on patients' functional status and quality of life, is a critical challenge for clinicians. A correct information of patients before the initiation of treatment, together with the adoption of preventive measures, could help to ameliorate their quality of life. The aim of this review is to describe the impact on quality of life of endocrine treatment side effects and analyze possible interventions to alleviate them.",[],Minerva urologica e nefrologica = The Italian journal of urology and nephrology,2017-12-16,"[{'lastname': 'Tucci', 'firstname': 'Marcello', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Turin, Italy - marcello.tucci@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Leone', 'firstname': 'Gianmarco', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Buttigliero', 'firstname': 'Consuelo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Zichi', 'firstname': 'Clizia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'DI Stefano', 'firstname': 'Rosario F', 'initials': 'RF', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pignataro', 'firstname': 'Daniele', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Vignani', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Ordine Mauriziano Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Scagliotti', 'firstname': 'Giorgio V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'DI Maio', 'firstname': 'Massimo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Ordine Mauriziano Hospital, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.'}]",,,,,10.23736/S0393-2249.17.03066-1,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddae3540>,,,,,,

11449190",Neuroanatomical and molecular correlates of cognitive and behavioural outcomes in hypogonadal males.,"Robust epidemiological, clinical and laboratory evidence supports emerging roles for the sex steroids in such domains as neurodevelopment, behaviour, learning and cognition. Regions of the mammalian brain that are involved in cognitive development and memory do not only express the classical nuclear androgen receptor, but also the non-genomic membrane receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates some rapid effects of the androgens on neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Under physiological conditions, hippocampal neurons do express the enzyme aromatase, and therefore actively aromatize testosterone to oestradiol. Although glial expression of the aromatase enzyme is minimal, increased expression following injury suggests a role for sex steroids in neuroprotection. It is therefore plausible to deduce that low levels of circulating androgens in males would perturb neuronal functions in relation to cognition and memory, as well as neural repair following injury. The present review is an overview of some roles of the sex steroids on cognitive function in males, and the neuroanatomical and molecular underpinnings of some behavioural and cognitive deficits characteristic of such genetic disorders noted for low androgen levels, including Klinefelter syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Kallman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Recent literature in relation to some behavioural and cognitive changes secondary to surgical and pharmacological castration are also appraised.","['Bardet-Biedl syndrome', 'Cognition and behaviour', 'Kallman syndrome', 'Klinefelter syndrome', 'Male hypogonadism', 'Prader-Willi syndrome']",Metabolic brain disease,2017-12-13,"[{'lastname': 'Akinola', 'firstname': 'O B', 'initials': 'OB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria. akinolub@unilorin.edu.ng.'}, {'lastname': 'Gabriel', 'firstname': 'M O', 'initials': 'MO', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s11011-017-0163-5,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddaeb9f0>,,,,,,
366,29210957,Physiological and Performance Effects of Caffeine Gum Consumed During a Simulated Half-Time by Professional Academy Rugby Union Players.,"Russell, M, Reynolds, NA, Crewther, BT, Cook, CJ, and Kilduff, L. Physiological and performance effects of caffeine gum consumed during a simulated half-time by professional academy rugby union players. J Strength Cond Res 34(1): 145-151, 2020-Despite the prevalence of caffeine (CAF) as an ergogenic aid, few studies have examined the use of caffeinated gums, especially during half-time in team sports. The physiological (blood lactate and salivary hormone concentrations) and performance (repeated sprints and cognitive function) effects of consuming CAF gum during a simulated half-time were examined. Professional academy rugby union players (n = 14) completed this double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced study. After pre-exercise measurements, players chewed a placebo (PLC) gum for 5 minutes before a standardized warm-up and completing repeated sprint testing (RSSA1). Thereafter, during a 15-minute simulated half-time period, players chewed either CAF (400 mg; 4.1 ± 0.5 mg·kg) or PLC gum for 5 minutes before completing a second repeated sprint test (RSSA2). Blood lactate, salivary testosterone and cortisol concentrations, and indices of cognitive function (i.e., reaction time and Stroop test) were measured at baseline, pre-RSSA1, post-RSSA1, pre-RSSA2, and post-RSSA2. Sprint performance was not affected by CAF (p = 0.995) despite slower sprint times after the first sprint of both RSSA tests (all p < 0.002). After half-time, salivary testosterone increased by 70% (+97 ± 58 pg·ml) in CAF vs. PLC (p < 0.001), whereas salivary cortisol remained unchanged (p = 0.307). Cognitive performance was unaffected by time and trial (all p > 0.05). Although performance effects were absent, chewing CAF gum increased the salivary testosterone concentrations of professional rugby union players over a simulated half-time. Practitioners may, therefore, choose to recommend CAF gum between successive exercise bouts because of the increases in salivary testosterone observed; a variable associated with increased motivation and high-intensity exercise performance.",[],Journal of strength and conditioning research,2017-12-07,"[{'lastname': 'Russell', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Social and Health Sciences, Leeds Trinity University, Leeds, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Reynolds', 'firstname': 'Nicholas A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Applied Sports Technology Exercise and Medicine Research Center (A-STEM), Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Crewther', 'firstname': 'Blair T', 'initials': 'BT', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Sport-National Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Cook', 'firstname': 'Christian J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom; and.'}, {'lastname': 'Kilduff', 'firstname': 'Liam P', 'initials': 'LP', 'affiliation': 'Applied Sports Technology Exercise and Medicine Research Center (A-STEM), Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.\nWelsh Institute of Performance Sciences (WIPS), Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.'}]",,,,,10.1519/JSC.0000000000002185,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05ddb16900>,,,,,,
367,29195161,Prenatal and pubertal testosterone affect brain lateralization.,"After decades of research, the influence of prenatal testosterone on brain lateralization is still elusive, whereas the influence of pubertal testosterone on functional brain lateralization has not been investigated, although there is increasing evidence that testosterone affects the brain in puberty. We performed a longitudinal study, investigating the relationship between prenatal testosterone concentrations in amniotic fluid, pubertal testosterone concentrations in saliva, and brain lateralization (measured with functional Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTCD)) of the Mental Rotation, Chimeric Faces and Word Generation tasks. Thirty boys and 30 girls participated in this study at the age of 15 years. For boys, we found a significant interaction effect between prenatal and pubertal testosterone on lateralization of Mental Rotation and Chimeric Faces. In the boys with low prenatal testosterone levels, pubertal testosterone was positively related to the strength of lateralization in the right hemisphere, while in the boys with high prenatal testosterone levels, pubertal testosterone was negatively related to the strength of lateralization. For Word Generation, pubertal testosterone was negatively related to the strength of lateralization in the left hemisphere in boys. For girls, we did not find any significant effects, possibly because their pubertal testosterone levels were in many cases below quantification limit. To conclude, prenatal and pubertal testosterone affect lateralization in a task-specific way. Our findings cannot be explained by simple models of prenatal testosterone affecting brain lateralization in a similar way for all tasks. We discuss alternative models involving age dependent effects of testosterone, with a role for androgen receptor distribution and efficiency.","['Brain asymmetry', 'Cognitive function', 'FTCD', 'Laterality', 'Puberty', 'Sex hormones']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2017-12-02,"[{'lastname': 'Beking', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'University of Groningen, Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences, Department Clinical & Developmental Neuropsychology, Grote Kruisstraat 2/1, 9712 TS Groningen, The Netherlands.

368,29194818,"Rapid nongenomic modulation by neurosteroids of dendritic spines in the hippocampus: Androgen, oestrogen and corticosteroid.","Memories are stored in synapses that consist of axon terminals and dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are postsynaptic structures of synapses and are essential for synaptic plasticity and cognition. Therefore, extensive investigations concerning the functions and structures of spines have been performed. Sex steroids and stress steroids have been shown to modulate hippocampal synapses. Although the rapid modulatory action of sex steroids on synapses has been studied in hippocampal neurones over several decades, the essential molecular mechanisms have not been fully understood. Here, a description of kinase-dependent signalling mechanisms is provided that can explain the rapid nongenomic modulation of dendritic spinogenesis in rat and mouse hippocampal slices by the application of sex steroids, including dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, oestradiol and progesterone. We also indicate the role of synaptic (classic) sex steroid receptors that trigger these rapid synaptic modulations. Moreover, we describe rapid nongenomic spine modulation by applying corticosterone, which is an acute stress model of the hippocampus. The explanations for the results obtained are mainly based on the optical imaging of dendritic spines. Comparisons are also performed with results obtained from other types of imaging, including electron microscopic imaging. Relationships between spine modulation and modulation of cognition are discussed. We recognise that most of rapid effects of exogenously applied oestrogen and androgen were observed in steroid-depleted conditions, including acute slices of the hippocampus, castrated male animals and ovariectomised female animals. Therefore, the previously observed effects can be considered as a type of recovery event, which may be essentially similar to hormone replacement therapy under hormone-decreased conditions. On the other hand, in gonadally intact young animals with high levels of endogenous sex hormones, further supplementation of sex hormones might not be effective, whereas the infusion of blockers for steroid receptors or kinases may be effective, with respect to suppressing sex hormone functions, thus providing useful information regarding molecular mechanisms.","['androgens', 'cortisol/corticosterone', 'glucocorticoids', 'membrane/nuclear receptors', 'neuroactive steroids', 'oestrogens', 'steroids']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2017-12-02,"[{'lastname': 'Murakami', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Liberal Arts, Faculty of Medicine, Saitama Medical University, Iruma, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hojo', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Saitama Medical University, Iruma, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kato', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics and Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Komatsuzaki', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics, College of Science and Technology, Nihon University, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Horie', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Hongo, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Soma', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawato', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics and Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan.\nDepartment of Urology, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Hongo, Tokyo, Japan.\nDepartment of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi, Tokyo, Japan.'}]",,,,© 2017 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/jne.12561,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dda739f0>,,,,,,
369,29178359,"Elevated luteinizing hormone despite normal testosterone levels in older men-natural history, risk factors and clinical features.","Elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) with normal testosterone (T) suggests compensated dysregulation of the gonadal axis. We describe the natural history, risk factors and clinical parameters associated with the development of high LH (HLH, LH >9.4 U/L) in ageing men with normal T (T ≥ 10.5 nmol/L).
We conducted a 4.3-year prospective observational study of 3369 community-dwelling European men aged 40-79 years. Participants were classified as follows: incident (i) HLH (n = 101, 5.2%); persistent (p) HLH (n = 128, 6.6%); reverted (r) HLH (n = 46, 2.4%); or persistent normal LH (pNLH, n = 1667, 85.8%). Potential predictors and changes in clinical features associated with iHLH and rHLH were analysed using regression models.
Age >70 years (OR = 4.12 [2.07-8.20]), diabetes (OR = 2.86 [1.42-5.77]), chronic pain (OR = 2.53 [1.34-4.77]), predegree education (OR = 1.79 [1.01-3.20]) and low physical activity (PASE ≤ 78, OR = 2.37 [1.24-4.50]) predicted development of HLH. Younger age (40-49 years, OR = 8.14 [1.35-49.13]) and nonsmoking (OR = 5.39 [1.48-19.65]) predicted recovery from HLH. Men with iHLH developed erectile dysfunction, poor health, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer more frequently than pNLH men. In pHLH men, comorbidities, including CVD, developed more frequently, and cognitive and physical function deteriorated more, than in pNLH men.

The extent and functional relevance of these abnormalities have not been studied with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis.
To examine white matter microstructure, neural volumes, and central nervous system (CNS) metabolites in CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) and to determine whether identified abnormalities are associated with cognition, glucocorticoid, and androgen exposure.
A cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital including 19 women (18 to 50 years) with 21OHD and 19 age-matched healthy women.
Recruits underwent cognitive assessment and brain imaging, including diffusion weighted imaging of white matter, T1-weighted volumetry, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for neural metabolites. We evaluated white matter microstructure by using tract-based spatial statistics. We compared cognitive scores, neural volumes, and metabolites between groups and relationships between glucocorticoid exposure, MRI, and neurologic outcomes.
Patients with 21OHD had widespread reductions in white matter structural integrity, reduced volumes of right hippocampus, bilateral thalami, cerebellum, and brainstem, and reduced mesial temporal lobe total choline content. Working memory, processing speed, and digit span and matrix reasoning scores were reduced in patients with 21OHD, despite similar education and intelligence to controls. Patients with 21OHD exposed to higher glucocorticoid doses had greater abnormalities in white matter microstructure and cognitive performance.

371,29143410,Early contributions to infants' mental rotation abilities.,"Some cognitive abilities exhibit reliable gender differences, with females outperforming males in specific aspects of verbal ability, and males showing an advantage on certain spatial tasks. Among these cognitive gender differences, differences in mental rotation are the most robust, and appear to be present even in infants. A large body of animal research suggests that gonadal hormones, particularly testosterone, during early development could contribute to this gender difference in mental rotation. Also, substantial evidence supports an influence of socialization on mental rotation performance. The present study investigated the relationship of two types of factors, early postnatal testosterone exposure and parental attitudes about gender, to mental rotation performance in 61 healthy infants (29 males, 32 females). We measured salivary testosterone at two time points: 1-2.5 months of age and 5-6 months of age. Infants' mental rotation performance and parents' attitudes about gender were assessed at 5-6 months of age. As predicted, testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in boys than girls in early infancy (d = 0.54), and boys performed significantly better than girls on mental rotation (d = 0.64). A significant positive correlation between testosterone at age 1-2.5 months and mental rotation was found only in boys (r = 0.50, p = .01). A significant negative correlation between parents' gender-stereotypical attitudes and mental rotation performance was found only in girls (r = -.57, p = .002). These findings suggest that the early postnatal testosterone surge (also known as ""mini-puberty"") may have organizational influences on mental rotation performance in boys, and that parents may influence their daughters' mental rotation abilities beginning very early in life.",[],Developmental science,2017-11-17,"[{'lastname': 'Constantinescu', 'firstname': 'Mihaela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'David S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Psychology Field Group, Pitzer College and Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Scott P', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hines', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}]",,,,© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/desc.12613,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dda33a40>,,,,,,

Prospective, observational, multicentre, open-label study of patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic or asymptomatic metastatic PCa scheduled to receive LHRH analogues for≥6 months. We assessed four CP domains at baseline and after 6 months of ADT: 1) Working memory: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS III) Digit Span Subtest (WAIS III-Digit); 2) Visual memory: ad hoc visual memory test; 3) Visuospatial ability: Judgement of Line Orientation (JLO) and Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects (3D-Rotation); and 4) Nonverbal analytical reasoning: WAIS III Matrix Reasoning Test (WAIS III-MRT). Changes outside the baseline 95% confidence intervals were considered significant.

374,29065316,Testosterone facilitates the sense of agency.,"Sense of agency (SoA) refers to feelings of being in control of one's actions. Evidence suggests that SoA might contribute towards higher-order feelings of personal control - a key attribute of powerful individuals. Whether testosterone, a steroid hormone linked to power in dominance hierarchies, also influences the SoA is not yet established. In a repeated-measures design, 26 females participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the effects of 0.5 mg testosterone on SoA, using an implicit measure based upon perceived shifts in time between a voluntary action and its outcome. Illusions of control, as operationalized by optimism in affective forecasting, were also assessed. Testosterone increased action binding but there was no significant effect on tone binding. Affective forecasting was found to be significantly more positive on testosterone. SoA and optimistic expectations are basic manifestations of power which may contribute to feelings of infallibility often associated with dominance and testosterone.","['Affective forecast', 'Control', 'Embodied cognition', 'Hormones', 'Mood', 'Power', 'Sense of agency', 'Testosterone']",Consciousness and cognition,2017-10-25,"[{'lastname': 'van der Westhuizen', 'firstname': 'Donné', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town, South Africa.

375,29054014,Sex differences in behavioral and neurochemical effects of gonadectomy and aromatase inhibition in rats.,"Aromatase inhibitors, which are widely used for the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers, have been associated with psychiatric side effects ranging from mania to depression. In the present study, we investigated sex differences in the behavioral and neurochemical effects of aromatase inhibition on male and female, sham-operated or gonadectomized adult rats. Three weeks after surgery, rats received chronic treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole or vehicle and were then subjected to the open field test, which assesses general activity. Half of the subjects were subsequently exposed to the stressful procedure of the forced swim test (FST), which is also a test of antidepressant activity. Aromatase activity was analyzed in the hypothalamus and testosterone and corticosterone were assayed in the blood serum of all rats. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were analyzed for monoamine (noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin), as well as amino acid (GABA, glutamate, glycine, taurine, alanine and histidine) levels. The observed decrease in hypothalamic aromatase activity confirmed the efficacy of letrozole treatment in both sexes. Moreover, letrozole enhanced testosterone levels in sham-operated females. In the open field test, females were overall more active and explorative than males and gonadectomy eliminated this sex difference. In the FST, females exhibited overall higher immobility than males and gonadectomy further enhanced this passive behavior in both sexes. However, sustained aromatase inhibition had no effect on open field and FST behaviors. Head shakes during FST, which were fewer in females than in males, were reduced by castration in males and by letrozole treatment in ovariectomized females, suggesting a role of testosterone and extra-gonadal estrogens in the expression of this behavior. Sustained aromatase inhibition also decreased noradrenaline and the dopaminergic turnover rates [DOPAC/DA, HVA/DA] in the hippocampus and PFC of male and female rats, irrespectively of gonadectomy. Moreover, letrozole treatment enhanced the serotonergic turnover [5HIAA/5HT] rate in the hippocampus of males and females, irrespectively of gonadectomy. Amino acid levels were not influenced by letrozole, but sex differences were demonstrated with higher levels in the PFC of females vs. males. Present findings suggest that the neuropsychiatric effects of aromatase inhibition can be attributed to the inhibition of extragonadal estrogen synthesis, presumably in the brain, and could be further associated with serotonergic and catecholaminergic changes in brain regions involved in mood and cognition. Importantly, present data could be linked with the neurobiology of affective side-effects in post-menopausal women receiving aromatase inhibitors.","['Amino acids', 'Castration', 'Estrogens', 'Forced swim test', 'Hippocampus', 'Letrozole', 'Monoamines', 'Open field', 'Ovariectomy', 'Prefrontal cortex', 'Rat', 'Stress', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2017-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kokras', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece; First Department of Psychiatry, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Pastromas', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Papasava', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'de Bournonville', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Research Group, GIGA Neurosciences, University of Liège, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Cornil', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Research Group, GIGA Neurosciences, University of Liège, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Dalla', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.

376,29044447,Relationship between androgen deficiency and memory impairment in aging and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.,"Aging and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) are associated with a declination of cognition and memory, whose severity increases in AD. Recent investigations point to a greater participation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) than that of senile plaques, as responsible for cognitive impairment in AD and normal aging. On the other hand, aging is related with reduced levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S) as well as testosterone (T). Basic and clinical studies give evidence that hypoandrogenism is associated with memory impairment. Accordingly, some animal studies show that the administration of these hormones improves the performance of cognitive tasks. However, effects of DHEA, DHEA-S, and T in the clinical setting, are not clear in part because of the balance between the benefits and risks of hormone therapy in aging subjects and because the cellular mechanism underlying its effects on memory in old age and related pathologies are unknown. The objective of this review is to analyze the role of DHEA, DHEA-S, and T, on memory in normal aging and in AD, and to determine whether these hormones modulate the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, a molecular marker in AD pathology. The method used in the review included articles from the PubMed database, using the following search terms: DHEA, DHEA-S, T, memory, androgen deprivation therapy, tau protein, aging, and AD. Finally, we analyze the use of these steroids as an adjunct in the treatment of memory deficits in aging subjects and AD patients.",[],Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,2017-10-19,"[{'lastname': 'Jiménez-Rubio', 'firstname': 'Graciela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorio de Farmacología Conductual.

3408446","Understanding the role of steroids in typical and atypical brain development: Advantages of using a ""brain in a dish"" approach.","Steroids have an important role in growth, development, sexual differentiation and reproduction. All four classes of steroids, androgens, oestrogens, progestogens and glucocorticoids, have varying effects on the brain. Androgens and oestrogens are involved in the sexual differentiation of the brain, and also influence cognition. Progestogens such as progesterone and its metabolites have been shown to be involved in neuroprotection, although their protective effects are timing-dependent. Glucocorticoids are linked with stress and memory performance, also in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Importantly, dysfunction in steroid function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of disease. Moreover, regulating steroid-signalling has been suggested as potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of a number of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, clarifying the role of steroids in typical and atypical brain function is essential for understanding typical brain functions, as well as determining their potential use for pharmacological intervention in the atypical brain. However, the majority of studies have thus far have been conducted using animal models, with limited work using native human tissue or cells. Here, we review the effect of steroids in the typical and atypical brain, focusing on the cellular, molecular functions of these molecules determined from animal models, and the therapeutic potential as highlighted by human studies. We further discuss the promise of human-induced pluripotent stem cells, including advantages of using three-dimensional neuronal cultures (organoids) in high-throughput screens, in accelerating our understanding of the role of steroids in the typical brain, and also with respect to their therapeutic value in the understanding and treatment of the atypical brain.","['17β-oestradiol', 'androgens', 'autism spectrum conditions', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'neurodevelopmental disorders', 'oestrogens', 'psychiatric', 'schizophrenia', 'stem cells', 'synapse', 'testosterone']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2017-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Adhya', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\nDepartment of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.\nMRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Annuario', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Lancaster', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Price', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.\nMRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London, London, UK.\nNational Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Baron-Cohen', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Srivastava', 'firstname': 'D P', 'initials': 'DP', 'affiliation': ""Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.\nMRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London, London, UK.""}]",,,,© 2017 The Authors.

28594925",The Role of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids in Disruption of the Physiological Function in Discrete Areas of the Central Nervous System.,"Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) abuse is often associated with a wide spectrum of adverse effects. These drugs are frequently abused by adolescents and athletes for esthetic purposes, as well as for improvement of their endurance and performances. In this literature review, we evaluated the correlation between AAS and anxiety or aggression. Two pathways are thought to be involved in AAS-induced behavioral disorders. Direct pathway via the amygdalo-fugal pathway, which connects the central nucleus of the amygdala to the brainstem, is involved in cognitive-emotive and homeostatic processes. The latter is modified by chronic AAS use, which subsequently leads to increased anxiety. Indirect pathways via the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic signals which are modified by AAS abuse in latero-anterior hypothalamus and can mediate the aggressive behavior. In conclusion, the molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral alterations following AAS abuse is unclear and remains ambiguous as additional long-term studies aimed to understand the precise mechanisms are required.","['Abuse', 'Amygdala', 'Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS)', 'Behavioral disorders', 'Central nervous system', 'Molecular mechanisms']",Molecular neurobiology,2017-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Bertozzi', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Forensic Pathology, University of Foggia, Ospedale Colonnello D'Avanzo, Foggia, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Sessa', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Forensic Pathology, University of Foggia, Ospedale Colonnello D'Avanzo, Foggia, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Albano', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe Davide', 'initials': 'GD', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Forensic Pathology, University of Foggia, Ospedale Colonnello D'Avanzo, Foggia, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Sani', 'firstname': 'Gabriele', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""NESMOS Department (Neurosciences, Mental Health, and Sensory Organs), Sapienza University of Rome, School of Medicine and Psychology, Sant'Andrea Hospital, Rome, Italy.\nCentro Lucio Bini, Rome, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Maglietta', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Forensic Pathology, University of Foggia, Ospedale Colonnello D'Avanzo, Foggia, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Roshan', 'firstname': 'Mohsin H K', 'initials': 'MHK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, University of Malta, Msida, Malta.'}, {'lastname': 'Volti', 'firstname': 'Giovanni Li', 'initials': 'GL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bernardini', 'firstname': 'Renato', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Avola', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pomara', 'firstname': 'Cristoforo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Forensic Pathology, University of Foggia, Ospedale Colonnello D'Avanzo, Foggia, Italy. cristoforo.pomara@unifg.it.\nDepartment of Anatomy, School of Medicine, University of Malta, Msida, Malta. cristoforo.pomara@unifg.it.\nD'Avanzo Hospital, 71122, Foggia, Italy. cristoforo.pomara@unifg.it.""}, {'lastname': 'Salerno', 'firstname': 'Monica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Forensic Pathology, University of Foggia, Ospedale Colonnello D'Avanzo, Foggia, Italy.""}]",,,,,"10.1007/s12035-017-0774-1

20921389",Dehydroepiandrosterone impacts working memory by shaping cortico-hippocampal structural covariance during development.,"Existing studies suggest that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may be important for human brain development and cognition. For example, molecular studies have hinted at the critical role of DHEA in enhancing brain plasticity. Studies of human brain development also support the notion that DHEA is involved in preserving cortical plasticity. Further, some, though not all, studies show that DHEA administration may lead to improvements in working memory in adults. Yet these findings remain limited by an incomplete understanding of the specific neuroanatomical mechanisms through which DHEA may impact the CNS during development. Here we examined associations between DHEA, cortico-hippocampal structural covariance, and working memory (216 participants [female=123], age range 6-22 years old, mean age: 13.6 +/-3.6 years, each followed for a maximum of 3 visits over the course of 4 years). In addition to administering performance-based, spatial working memory tests to these children, we also collected ecological, parent ratings of working memory in everyday situations. We found that increasingly higher DHEA levels were associated with a shift toward positive insular-hippocampal and occipito-hippocampal structural covariance. In turn, DHEA-related insular-hippocampal covariance was associated with lower spatial working memory but higher overall working memory as measured by the ecological parent ratings. Taken together with previous research, these results support the hypothesis that DHEA may optimize cortical functions related to general attentional and working memory processes, but impair the development of bottom-up, hippocampal-to-cortical connections, resulting in impaired encoding of spatial cues.","['Adolescence', 'Androgen', 'Attention', 'Brain development', 'Cortical thickness', 'DHEA', 'Puberty', 'Structural magnetic resonance imaging']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2017-09-26,"[{'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Tuong-Vi', 'initials': 'TV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A1A1, Canada; Department of Obstetrics-Gynecology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, H4A 3J1, Canada; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, H4A 3J1, Canada.

380,28946020,A randomized controlled study of power posing before public speaking exposure for social anxiety disorder: No evidence for augmentative effects.,"This manuscript details a randomized controlled study designed to test the efficacy of power posing (i.e., briefly holding postures associated with dominance and power) as an augmentative strategy for exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Seventy-three individuals diagnosed with SAD were assigned to one of three conditions: power posing, submissive posing, or rest (no posing) prior to participating in an exposure therapy session. Participants were assessed for between-group differences in pre- and post-manipulation salivary hormone levels, within-session subjective experiences of fear, and pre- and 1-week post-treatment SAD severity outcome measures. Though the intervention resulted in decreased SAD symptom severity one week later, analyses revealed no significant between-group differences on any tested variables. Accordingly, this study provides no evidence to suggest that power posing impacts hormone levels or exposure therapy outcomes.","['Exposure therapy', 'Randomized trial', 'Social anxiety disorder']",Journal of anxiety disorders,2017-09-26,"[{'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Michelle L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Institute for Mental Health Research, The University of Texas at Austin, United States.

381,28914204,A Review on the Effects of Testosterone Supplementation in Hypogonadal Men with Cognitive Impairment.,"Cognitive function and testosterone level of men decline concurrently with age. Low testosterone levels are associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment in men. There are continuous debates on whether this relationship is casual. This paper aims to summarize the current evidence on the association between testosterone level and cognitive function in elderly men. The presence of testosterone, androgen receptor and its responsive genes indicates that testosterone has biological functions in the central nervous system. The ability of the body to convert testosterone into estrogen suggests that part of the actions of testosterone could be mediated by estrogen. Observational studies generally showed that low endogenous testosterone levels were associated with poor cognitive performance in healthy elderly men. Testosterone substitution exerted positive effects on certain cognitive domains in normal and hypogonadal elderly men. In conclusion, testosterone may influence cognitive function in elderly men and its substitution may be considered in men with cognitive impairment and testosterone deficiency.","['Aging', 'Alzheimer', 'brain', 'cognitive ability', 'hypogonadism', 'testosterone.']",Current drug targets,2017-09-16,"[{'lastname': 'Mohamad', 'firstname': 'Nur Vaizura', 'initials': 'NV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ima-Nirwana', 'firstname': 'Soelaiman', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chin', 'firstname': 'Kok-Yong', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.'}]",,,,"Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.",10.2174/1389450118666170913162739,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd913310>,,,,,,

20488256",Postmenopausal cognitive changes and androgen levels in the context of apolipoprotein E polymorphism.,"The focus of this study was to assess cognitive functions in relation to androgens and specifically testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in postmenopausal women as well as the correlation between cognitive functions and these two androgens according to polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE).
A group of 402 women was recruited to the study (minimum 2 years after the last menstruation, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) more than 30 U/ml and no dementia signs on Montreal Cognitive Assessment). The computerized battery of the Central Nervous System Vital Signs test was used to diagnose cognitive functions. APOE genotyping was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Testosterone (TTE) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in the blood serum were assessed for further statistical correlations analysis.
In the group of postmenopausal women, higher testosterone concentration was associated with lower scores for Neurocognition Index (NCI) (
Hormonal balance variations after menopause may influence brain processes concerned with cognition, especially memory and psychomotor speed. The observed effects may be related to androgens' influence on higher cortical functions in the changed hormonal dynamics of the postmenopausal period.","['apolipoprotein E', 'cognitive functions', 'dehydroepiandrosterone', 'menopause', 'testosterone']",Archives of medical science : AMS,2017-09-09,"[{'lastname': 'Bojar', 'firstname': 'Iwona', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department for Women Health, Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pinkas', 'firstname': 'Jarosław', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Center of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gujski', 'firstname': 'Mariusz', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention of Environmental Hazards and Allergology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Owoc', 'firstname': 'Alfred', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Public Health and Health Promotion, Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Raczkiewicz', 'firstname': 'Dorota', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Statistics and Demography, Warsaw School of Economics, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gustaw-Rothenberg', 'firstname': 'Kasia', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Lou Ruvo Brain Wellness Center, Neurological Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.\nDepartment of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland.'}]",,,"In the group of postmenopausal women, higher testosterone concentration was associated with lower scores for Neurocognition Index (NCI) (",,10.5114/aoms.2016.62869,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd91c400>,,,,,,

Testosterone is increasingly being prescribed. Particularly in the setting of recent data suggestive of possible cardiovascular risk associated with its use; a clear understanding of the domains of health that improve with exogenous testosterone use is important. Data on endogenous and exogenous testosterone with cognition and mood are mixed, likely partly related to methodological differences of type of testosterone, patient population, and dosing.
Overall, available data are not suggestive of a clear benefit of testosterone supplementation in multiple domains of cognition and in mood.

385,28818501,Is human brain masculinization estrogen receptor-mediated? Reply to Luoto and Rantala.,"Human genetic males are unlike rodent males in that neither the ability to convert testosterone to estrogen nor a functional estrogen receptor (ER) appears necessary for male-typical behavior, but a functional androgen receptor (AR) is required. Brain masculinization is probably mainly AR-mediated in human genetic males. ER binding may nevertheless have important masculinizing or defeminizing effects in human genetic females. Probably the strongest available evidence on this issue is derived from females exposed to synthetic estrogens in utero due to their mother's treatment with DES. As we review, the totality of evidence from this population indicates little or no effect of estrogens on sexuality in genetic females. In addition, if brain masculinization were ER-mediated in humans, it seems unlikely that sex hormone-binding globulin would bind estrogens so effectively as to prevent them from masculinizing the brain. In sum, current evidence suggests that estrogen plays a limited role in masculinizing the human brain and behavior.","['Androgen receptor', 'Aromatase', 'Diethylstilbestrol', 'Estrogen receptor', 'Sexuality', 'Testosterone']",Hormones and behavior,2017-08-19,"[{'lastname': 'Puts', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA; Center for Brain, Behavior, and Cognition, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA; Center for Human Evolution and Diversity, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.

10097774",Impact of new generation hormone-therapy on cognitive function in elderly patients treated for a metastatic prostate cancer: Cog-Pro trial protocol.,"New generation hormone-therapies (NGHT) targeting the androgen signalling pathway are nowadays proposed to elderly patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). The impact of these treatments on cognitive function has never been evaluated whereas cognitive impairment may have an impact on the autonomy and the treatment adherence. The aim of this study is to prospectively assess the incidence of cognitive impairment in elderly men after treatment by NGHT for a metastatic CRPCa.
The Cog-Pro study is a multicentre longitudinal study including CRPCa patients ≥70 years old treated with NGHT (n = 134), control metastatic prostate cancer patients without castration resistance treated with first generation androgen deprivation therapy (n = 55), and healthy participants (n = 33), matched on age and education. Cognitive, geriatric and quality of life assessment and biological tests will be performed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after start of the treatment (inclusion time). The primary endpoint is the proportion of elderly patients receiving a NGHT who will experience a decline in cognitive performances within 3 months after study enrollment. Secondary endpoints concern: autonomy, quality of life, anxiety, depression, cognitive reserve, adherence to hormone-therapy, comparison of the cognitive impact of 2 different NGHT (abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide), impact of co-morbidities and biological assessments.
Evaluating, understanding and analyzing the incidence, severity of cognitive impairments and their impact on quality of life, autonomy and adherence in this group of patients with advanced disease is a challenge. This study should help to improve cancer care of elderly patients and secure the use of oral treatments as the risk of non-observance does exist. Our results will provide up-to date information for patients and caregivers on impact of these treatments on cognitive function in order to help the physicians in the choice of the treatment.

387,28811112,Exogenous testosterone affects early threat processing in socially anxious and healthy women.,"Testosterone plays an important role in social threat processing. Recent evidence suggests that testosterone administration has socially anxiolytic effects, but it remains unknown whether this involves early vigilance or later, more sustained, processing-stages. We investigated the acute effects of testosterone administration on social threat processing in 19 female patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 19 healthy controls. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during an emotional Stroop task with subliminally presented faces. Testosterone induced qualitative changes in early ERPs (<200ms after stimulus onset) in both groups. An initial testosterone-induced spatial shift reflected a change in the basic processing (N170/VPP) of neutral faces, which was followed by a shift for angry faces suggesting a decrease in early threat bias. These findings suggest that testosterone specifically affects early automatic social information processing. The decreased attentional bias for angry faces explains how testosterone can decrease threat avoidance, which is particularly relevant for SAD.","['Emotional stroop', 'Event-related potentials', 'Social anxiety', 'Social threat', 'Testosterone']",Biological psychology,2017-08-16,"[{'lastname': 'van Peer', 'firstname': 'Jacobien M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Radboud University Nijmegen, Behavioural Science Institute (BSI), Nijmegen, Montessorilaan 3, PO Box 9104, 6500 HE Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands..

24361350",Body composition changes with testosterone replacement therapy following spinal cord injury and aging: A mini review.,"Context Hypogonadism is a male clinical condition in which the body does not produce enough testosterone. Testosterone plays a key role in maintaining body composition, bone mineral density, sexual function, mood, erythropoiesis, cognition and quality of life. Hypogonadism can occur due to several underlying pathologies during aging and in men with physical disabilities, such as spinal cord injury (SCI). This condition is often under diagnosed and as a result, symptoms undertreated. Methods In this mini-review, we propose that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may be a viable strategy to improve lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM) in men with SCI. Evidence Synthesis Supplementing the limited data from SCI cohorts with consistent findings from studies in non-disabled aging men, we present evidence that, relative to placebo, transdermal TRT can increase LBM and reduce FM over 3-36 months. The impact of TRT on bone mineral density and metabolism is also discussed, with particular relevance for persons with SCI. Moreover, the risks of TRT remain controversial and pertinent safety considerations related to transdermal administration are outlined. Conclusion Further research is necessary to help develop clinical guidelines for the specific dose and duration of TRT in persons with SCI. Therefore, we call for more high-quality randomized controlled trials to examine the efficacy and safety of TRT in this population, which experiences an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases as a result of deleterious body composition changes after injury.","['Body composition', 'Fat mass', 'Lean body mass', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testosterone replacement therapy']",The journal of spinal cord medicine,2017-08-05,"[{'lastname': 'Nightingale', 'firstname': 'Tom E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'a Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Center , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.\nb Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation , Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'Pamela', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'a Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Center , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Harman', 'firstname': 'Joshua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'a Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Center , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Khalil', 'firstname': 'Refka', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'a Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Center , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gill', 'firstname': 'Ranjodh S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'c Endocrinology Service , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.\nd Endocrine Division , Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Castillo', 'firstname': 'Teodoro', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'a Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Center , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.\nb Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation , Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Adler', 'firstname': 'Robert A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'c Endocrinology Service , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.\nd Endocrine Division , Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gorgey', 'firstname': 'Ashraf S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'a Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Center , Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.\nb Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation , Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1080/10790268.2017.1357917

392,28760247,Psychometric Evaluation of the Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire Short Form (HIS-Q-SF).,"The Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire Short Form (HIS-Q-SF) is a patient-reported outcome measurement designed to evaluate the symptoms of hypogonadism. The HIS-Q-SF is an abbreviated version including17 items from the original 28-item HIS-Q.
To conduct item analyses and reduction, evaluate the psychometric properties of the HIS-Q-SF, and provide guidance on score interpretation.
A 12-week observational longitudinal study of hypogonadal men was conducted as part of the original HIS-Q psychometric evaluation. Participants completed the original HIS-Q every 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected to evaluate testosterone levels. Participants completed the Aging Male's Symptoms Scale, the International Index of Erectile Function, the Short Form-12, and the PROMIS Sexual Activity, Satisfaction with Sex Life, Sleep Disturbance, and Applied Cognition Scales (baseline and weeks 6 and 12). Clinicians completed the Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Change scales and a clinical form.
Item performance was evaluated using descriptive statistics and Rasch analyses. Reliability (internal consistency and test-retest), validity (concurrent and know groups), and responsiveness were assessed.
One hundred seventy-seven men participated (mean age = 54.1 years, range = 23-83). Similar to the full HIS-Q, the final abbreviated HIS-Q-SF instrument includes five domains (sexual, energy, sleep, cognition, and mood) with two sexual subdomains (libido and sexual function). For key domains, test-retest reliability was very good, and construct validity was good for all domains. Known-groups validity was demonstrated for all domain scores, subdomain scores, and total score based on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity. All domains and subdomains were responsive to change based on patient-rated anchor questions.
The HIS-Q-SF could be a useful tool in clinical practice, epidemiologic studies, and other academic research settings.
Careful consideration was given to the selection of the final HIS-Q-SF items based on quantitative data and clinical expert feedback. Overall, the reduced set of items demonstrated strong psychometric properties. Testosterone levels for the participating men were not as low as anticipated, which could have limited the ability to examine the relations between the HIS-Q-SF and testosterone levels. Further, the analyses used data collected through administration of the full HIS-Q, and future studies should administer the standalone HIS-Q-SF to replicate the psychometric analyses reported in the present study.
Similar to the original HIS-Q, the HIS-Q-SF has evidence supporting reliability, validity, and responsiveness. The short form includes a smaller set of items that might be more suitable for use in clinical practice or academic research settings. Gelhorn HL, Roberts LJ, Khandelwal N, et al.

393,28716218,The risk of dementia with the use of 5 alpha reductase inhibitors.,"There has been considerable interest in the interplay between testosterone and cognition. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which has been correlated with cognitive function, is significantly reduced with the use of 5 alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI) for prostatic enlargement. Our objective was to assess whether the use of 5ARIs was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia.
We used a matched cohort design and linked administrative data from the province of Ontario, Canada. A total of 99 covariates were measured, and a propensity score was used for matching; 81,162 men who used a 5ARIs were matched to an equal number of men who did not.
New initiation of 5ARI medication was associated with an increased risk of dementia during the first (HR 2.18, 95% CI 2.01-2.35) and second (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.39-1.67) year, however this risk was nonsignificant among the men with the longest exposure to 5ARIs (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98-1.14). There was no difference in the results between types of 5ARIs.
As the strength of the association decreased with increased exposure, the higher risk seen in the initial two years likely represents the presentation and treatment of urinary symptoms which coexist with mild cognitive impairment and eventually progresses to a diagnosis of dementia.","['5-Alpha reductase inhibitors', 'Dementia', 'Dutasteride', 'Finasteride']",Journal of the neurological sciences,2017-07-19,"[{'lastname': 'Welk', 'firstname': 'Blayne', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Western University, London, ON, Canada; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, ON, Canada; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University, London, ON, Canada.

We evaluated changes in CP after 6 months of medical castration with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues.
We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter, open-label study of PCa patients scheduled to receive LHRH analogues for ≥6 months. We assessed 4 domains of CP at baseline and after 6 months of ADT: (1) working memory, assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS III) Digit Span subtest; (2) visual memory, assessed with an ad hoc visual memory test; (3) visuospatial ability, assessed with the Judgment of Line Orientation test and Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects test; and (4) nonverbal analytical reasoning, assessed with the WAIS III Matrix Reasoning test. Changes outside the baseline 95% confidence intervals were considered significant.

21762880",Acute gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment enhances extinction memory in male rats.,"Leuprolide acetate (LEU), also known as Lupron, is commonly used to treat prostate cancer in men. As a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonist, it initially stimulates the release of gonadal hormones, testosterone (T) and estradiol. This surge eventually suppresses these hormones, preventing the further growth and spread of cancer cells. Individuals receiving this treatment often report anxiety and cognitive changes, but LEU's effects on the neural mechanisms that are involved in anxiety during the trajectory of treatment are not well known. In this study, we examined the acute effects of LEU on fear extinction, hypothesizing that increased T levels following a single administration of LEU will facilitate extinction recall by altering neuronal activity within the fear extinction circuitry. Two groups of naïve adult male rats underwent a 3-day fear conditioning, extinction, and recall experiment. The delayed group (n=15) received a single injection of vehicle or LEU (1.2mg/kg) 3weeks before behavioral testing. The acute group (n=25) received an injection one day after fear conditioning, 30min prior to extinction training. Following recall, the brains for all animals were collected for c-fos immunohistochemistry. Blood samples were also collected and assayed for T levels. Acute administration of LEU increased serum T levels during extinction training and enhanced extinction recall 24h later. This enhanced extinction memory was correlated with increased c-fos activity within the infralimbic cortex and amygdala, which was not observed in the delayed group. These results suggest that the elevation in T induced by acute administration of LEU can influence extinction memory consolidation, perhaps through modification of neuronal activity within the infralimbic cortex and amygdala. This may be an important consideration in clinical applications of LEU and its effects on anxiety and cognition.","['Anxiety', 'Fear extinction', 'Leuprolide acetate', 'Lupron', 'Testosterone', 'c-fos']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2017-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Maeng', 'firstname': 'L Y', 'initials': 'LY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, 02129, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, United States.

25637074",Erythrocytosis Following Testosterone Therapy.,"A rapid increase in awareness of androgen deficiency has led to substantial increases in prescribing of testosterone therapy (TTh), with benefits of improvements in mood, libido, bone density, muscle mass, body composition, energy, and cognition. However, TTh can be limited by its side effects, particularly erythrocytosis. This review examines the literature on testosterone-induced erythrocytosis and polycythemia.
To review the available literature on testosterone-induced erythrocytosis, discuss possible mechanisms for pathophysiology, determine the significance of formulation, and elucidate potential thromboembolic risk.
A literature review was performed using PubMed for articles addressing TTh, erythrocytosis, and polycythemia.
Mechanism, pharmacologic contribution, and risk of testosterone-induced erythrocytosis.
For men undergoing TTh, the risk of developing erythrocytosis compared with controls is well established, with short-acting injectable formulations having the highest associated incidence. Potential mechanisms explaining the relation between TTh and erythrocytosis include the role of hepcidin, iron sequestration and turnover, erythropoietin production, bone marrow stimulation, and genetic factors. High blood viscosity increases the risk for potential vascular complications involving the coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular circulations, although there is limited evidence supporting a relation between TTh and vascular complications.
Short-acting injectable testosterone is associated with greater risk of erythrocytosis compared with other formulations. The mechanism of the pathophysiology and its role on thromboembolic events remain unclear, although some data support an increased risk of cardiovascular events resulting from testosterone-induced erythrocytosis.

14764757",Associations of androgens with depressive symptoms and cognitive status in the general population.,"Associations between androgens and depressive symptoms were mostly reported from cross-sectional and patient-based studies.
Longitudinal data from 4,110 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania were used to assess sex-specific associations of baseline total and free testosterone, androstenedione and sex hormone-binding globulin with incident depressive symptoms and cognitive status at 5- and 10-year follow-up.
Despite sex-specific differences in depressive symptoms prevalence at baseline (women: 17.4%, men: 8.1%), cross-sectional analyses showed no associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. In age-adjusted longitudinal analyses, total testosterone was associated with incident depressive symptoms (relative risk at 5-year follow-up: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.92). Similarly, age-adjusted analyses showed a positive association between sex hormone-binding globulin and cognitive status in men (β-coefficient per standard deviation: 0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.74). In women, age-adjusted associations of androstenedione with baseline depressive symptoms (relative risk: 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.99) were found. None of the observed associations remained after multivariable adjustment.
The present population-based, longitudinal study revealed inverse associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. However, the null finding after multivariable adjustment suggests, that the observed associations were not independent of relevant confounders including body mass index, smoking and physical inactivity. Furthermore, the low number of incident endpoints in our non-clinical population-based sample limited the statistical power and reduced the chance to detect a statistically significant effect.",[],PloS one,2017-05-13,"[{'lastname': 'Kische', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gross', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nDepartment of Cardiology, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wallaschofski', 'firstname': 'Henri', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Grabe', 'firstname': 'Hans Jörgen', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Völzke', 'firstname': 'Henry', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nInstitute for Community Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nauck', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Haring', 'firstname': 'Robin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nEuropean University of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Applied Public Health, Rostock, Germany.\nSchool of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}]",,,"Despite sex-specific differences in depressive symptoms prevalence at baseline (women: 17.4%, men: 8.1%), cross-sectional analyses showed no associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms.

403,28489322,Developmental effects of androgens in the human brain.,"Neuroendocrine theories of brain development posit that androgens play a crucial role in sex-specific cortical growth, although little is known about the differential effects of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on cortico-limbic development and cognition during adolescence. In this context, the National Institutes of Health Study of Normal Brain Development, a longitudinal study of typically developing children and adolescents aged 4-24 years (n=433), offers a unique opportunity to examine the developmental effects of androgens on cortico-limbic maturation and cognition. Using data from this sample, our group found that higher testosterone levels were associated with left-sided decreases in cortical thickness (CTh) in post-pubertal boys, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, compared to right-sided increases in CTh in somatosensory areas in pre-pubertal girls. Prefrontal-amygdala and prefrontal-hippocampal structural covariance (considered to reflect structural connectivity) also varied according to testosterone levels, with the testosterone-related brain phenotype predicting higher aggression levels and lower executive function, particularly in boys. By contrast, DHEA was associated with a pre-pubertal increase in CTh of several regions involved in cognitive control in both boys and girls. Covariance within several cortico-amygdalar structural networks also varied as a function of DHEA levels, with the DHEA-related brain phenotype predicting improvements in visual attention in both boys and girls. DHEA-related cortico-hippocampal structural covariance, on the other hand, predicted higher scores on a test of working memory. Interestingly, there were significant interactions between testosterone and DHEA, such that DHEA tended to mitigate the anti-proliferative effects of testosterone on brain structure. In sum, testosterone-related effects on the developing brain may lead to detrimental effects on cortical functions (ie, higher aggression and lower executive function), whereas DHEA-related effects may optimise cortical functions (ie, better attention and working memory), perhaps by decreasing the influence of amygdalar and hippocampal afferents on cortical functions.","['\ndehydroepiandrosterone\n', 'adolescence', 'brain development', 'brain structure', 'puberty', 'testosterone']",Journal of neuroendocrinology,2017-05-11,"[{'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'T-V', 'initials': 'TV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nDepartment of Obstetrics-Gynecology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}]",,,,© 2017 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.,10.1111/jne.12486,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd71b8b0>,,,,,,

27158240",Effects of ginseng on two main sex steroid hormone receptors: estrogen and androgen receptors.,"Ginseng has been used in China for at least two millennia and is now popular in over 35 countries. It is one of the world's popular herbs for complementary and alternative medicine and has been shown to have helpful effects on cognition and blood circulation, as well as anti-aging, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic effects, among many others. The pharmacological activities of ginseng are dependent mainly on ginsenosides. Ginsenosides have a cholesterol-like four trans-ring steroid skeleton with a variety of sugar moieties. Nuclear receptors are one of the most important molecular targets of ginseng, and reports have shown that members of the nuclear receptor superfamily are regulated by a variety of ginsenosides. Here, we review the published literature on the effects of ginseng and its constituents on two main sex steroid hormone receptors: estrogen and androgen receptors. Furthermore, we discuss applications for sex steroid hormone receptor modulation and their therapeutic efficacy.","['androgen receptor', 'estrogen receptor', 'ginseng', 'nuclear receptor', 'steroid hormone receptor']",Journal of ginseng research,2017-04-18,"[{'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Joonwoo', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Science, Sejong University, Kwangjingu, Kunjadong, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Heewon', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Science, Sejong University, Kwangjingu, Kunjadong, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Si-Kwan', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Myeong Soo', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Rhee', 'firstname': 'Dong-Kwon', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'YoungJoo', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Science, Sejong University, Kwangjingu, Kunjadong, Seoul, Korea.'}]",,,,,10.1016/j.jgr.2016.08.005,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd6c3400>,,,,,,
407,28408350,Neuroactive steroid levels and psychiatric and andrological features in post-finasteride patients.,"Recent reports show that, in patients treated with finasteride for male pattern hair loss, persistent side effects including sexual side effects, depression, anxiety and cognitive complaints may occur. We here explored the psychiatric and andrological features of patients affected by post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and verified whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of neuroactive steroids (i.e., important regulators of nervous function) are modified. We found that eight out of sixteen PFS male patients considered suffered from a DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, all PFS patients showed erectile dysfunction (ED); in particular, ten patients showed a severe and six a mild-moderate ED. We also reported abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials of the pudendal nerve in PFS patients with severe ED, the first objective evidence of a neuropathy involving peripheral neurogenic control of erection. Testicular volume by ultrasonography was normal in PFS patients. Data obtained on neuroactive steroid levels also indicate interesting features. Indeed, decreased levels of pregnenolone, progesterone and its metabolite (i.e., dihydroprogesterone), dihydrotestosterone and 17beta-estradiol and increased levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone and 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol were observed in CSF of PFS patients. Neuroactive steroid levels were also altered in plasma of PFS patients, however these changes did not reflect exactly what occurs in CSF. Finally, finasteride did not only affect, as expected, the levels of 5alpha-reduced metabolites of progesterone and testosterone, but also the further metabolites and precursors suggesting that this drug has broad consequence on neuroactive steroid levels of PFS patients.","['5α-Reductase', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Major depressive disorder', 'Pregnenolone', 'Progesterone', 'Testosterone']",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2017-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Melcangi', 'firstname': 'Roberto Cosimo', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche e Biomolecolari, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.

20409644",The role of cholesterol metabolism and various steroid abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders: A hypothesis paper.,"Based on evidence from the relevant research literature, we present a hypothesis that there may be a link between cholesterol, vitamin D, and steroid hormones which subsequently impacts on the development of at least some of the ""autisms"" [Coleman & Gillberg]. Our hypothesis, driven by the peer reviewed literature, posits that there may be links between cholesterol metabolism, which we will refer to as ""steroid metabolism"" and findings of steroid abnormalities of various kinds (cortisol, testosterone, estrogens, progesterone, vitamin D) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Further research investigating these potential links is warranted to further our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying ASD.

409,28333214,'Forever Young'-Testosterone replacement therapy: a blockbuster drug despite flabby evidence and broken promises.,"In the last decade, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has been increasingly prescribed to treat a controversial condition known as 'late-onset hypogonadism (LOH)'. This syndrome is diagnosed in men who, for no discernible reason other than older age, obesity or ill health have serum testosterone concentrations below the normal range for healthy young men and report one or more of the following symptoms: muscle weakness or wasting, mood, behaviour and cognition-related symptoms and sexual function or libido impairment. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that testosterone drugs do not substantially ameliorate these symptoms and, more worryingly, that their long-term use may be associated with severe adverse effects (i.e. increased risk of prostate cancer, stroke and myocardial infarction, worsening of benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and testicular atrophy). Nonetheless, testosterone drugs have exhibited extraordinary commercial success and their pharmaceutical sales are steadily rising. Behind this apparently unjustifiable trend there are deliberate, well designed direct and indirect pharmaceutical marketing initiatives that exploit the conviction rooted in contemporary society that testosterone can reverse the effects of ageing and ensure social accomplishment. Commercial mechanisms have laid the foundation for disease mongering of LOH and also have resulted a considerable expansion of the indications for treatment. This promotion model deserves particular attention since it is applicable to any drug with a purportedly favourable risk-benefit ratio not supported by evidence.","['LOH', 'TRT', 'disease mongering', 'late-onset hypogonadism', 'marketing campaign', 'risk-benefit ratio', 'testosterone', 'testosterone replacement therapy']","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",2017-03-24,"[{'lastname': 'Busnelli', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Infertility Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Via M.

410,28325650,"The potential role of follicle-stimulating hormone in the cardiovascular, metabolic, skeletal, and cognitive effects associated with androgen deprivation therapy.","To explore how follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may contribute to cardiovascular, metabolic, skeletal, and cognitive events in men treated for prostate cancer, with various forms of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).
A colloquium of prostate cancer experts was convened in May 2015, to discuss the role of FSH in the development of unwanted effects associated with ADT. Subsequently, a literature review (Medline, PubMed, and relevant congress abstract databases) was performed to further explore and evaluate the collected evidence.
It has become evident that, in the setting of ADT, FSH can promote the development of atherosclerotic plaque formation, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. Data also suggest that FSH is an important mediator of bone remodeling, particularly bone resorption, and thereby increases the risk for bone fracture. Additional evidence implicates a role for FSH in bone metastasis as well. The influence of FSH on ADT-induced cognitive deficits awaits further elucidation; however, the possibility that FSH may be involved therein cannot be ruled out.
The widespread molecular and physiological consequences of FSH system activation in normal and pathological conditions are becoming better understood. Progress in this area has been achieved by the development of additional investigative and clinical measures to better evaluate specific adverse effects. More research is needed on FSH function in the development of cancer as well as its association with cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and cognitive effects in ADT.","['Bone', 'Cardiovascular', 'Cognition', 'Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Prostate cancer']",Urologic oncology,2017-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Crawford', 'firstname': 'E David', 'initials': 'ED', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urologic Oncology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, Denver, CO.

6835476",Cognitive Impacts of Estrogen Treatment in Androgen-Deprived Males: What Needs to be Resolved.,"Many prostate cancer (PCa) patients are on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as part of their cancer treatments but ADT may lead to cognitive impairments. ADT depletes men of both androgen and estrogen. Whether estradiol supplementation can improve cognitive impairments in patients on ADT is understudied.
To summarize data on the effects of estradiol treatment on cognitive function of androgen-deprived genetic male populations (PCa patients and male-to-female transsexuals) and castrated male animals.
Publications were identified by a literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar.
While some studies showed that estradiol improves cognitive function (most notably, spatial ability) for castrated rats, what remains uninvestigated are: 1) whether estradiol can improve cognition after long-term androgen deprivation, 2) how estradiol affects memory retention, and 3) how early vs. delayed estradiol treatment after castration influences cognition. For androgendeprived genetic males, estradiol treatment may improve some cognitive functions (e.g., verbal and visual memory), but the findings are not consistent due to large variability in the study design between studies.
Future studies are required to determine the best estradiol treatment protocol to maximize cognitive benefits for androgen-deprived genetic males. Tests that assess comparable cognitive domains in human and rodents are needed. What particularly under-investigated is how the effects of estradiol on cognitive ability intersect with other parameters; sleep, depression and physical fatigue. Such studies have clinical implications to improve the quality of life for both PCa patients on ADT as well as for male-to-female transsexuals.","['Estradiol', 'androgen deprivation therapy', 'cognition', 'male-to-female transsexuals', 'prostate cancer', 'spatial memory.', 'verbal memory', 'visual memory']",Current neuropharmacology,2017-03-16,"[{'lastname': 'Wibowo', 'firstname': 'Erik', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Level 6, 2775 Laurel Street, Gordon & Leslie Diamond Health Care Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 1M9.

Double-blind trial of 84 boys, ages 4-12 years, randomized to oxandrolone (Ox; 0.06?mg/kg daily; n?=?43) or placebo (Pl; n?=?41) for 24 months. Standardized assessments were performed at baseline and every 12 months for 24 months evaluating motor, cognitive, and behavioral function.
The 24-month outcomes were better in the Ox vs. Pl group on 1 of 5 primary endpoints (motor function/strength): Bruininks Visual-Motor scale (P?=?.005), without significant differences between the 2 groups for the other 4 components. Secondary analyses suggested improvement in the Ox vs. Pl group in the anxiety/depression (P?=?.03) and social problems (P?=?.01) scales on the Child Behavior Checklist, anxiety (P?=?.04) on the Piers Harris Self Concept Scale, and interpersonal problems (P?=?.02) on the Children's Depression Inventory, without significant differences in hyperactive or aggressive behaviors.
This double-blind, randomized trial demonstrates that 24 months of childhood low-dose androgen treatment in boys with Klinefelter syndrome benefited 1 of 5 primary endpoints (visual-motor function). Secondary analyses demonstrated positive effects of androgen on aspects of psychosocial function (anxiety, depression, social problems), without significant effects on cognitive function, or hyperactive or aggressive behaviors.

413,28281909,Positive association of personal distress with testosterone in opiate-addicted patients.,"Clinical studies report that substance addictions are associated with sociocognitive impairments. Regarding opiate-addicted patients, the few existing studies point to deficits in empathic abilities. Previous research suggests that testosterone might be a relevant biomarker of these impairments. The authors aimed to investigate whether opiate-addicted patients show specific impairments in emotional (empathic concern, personal distress) and cognitive empathy compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the authors aimed to assess possible associations of testosterone levels with impaired empathic abilities in the patients' group. In this cross-sectional study, 27 opiate-addicted, diacetylmorphine-maintained patients (21 males, age mean 41.67 years, standard deviation 8.814) and 31 healthy controls (23 males, age mean 40.77 years, standard deviation 8.401) matched in age, sex, and educational level were examined. Cognitive and emotional empathy were measured via the German version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index and salivary testosterone levels were assessed. The authors found higher personal distress scores (p < 0.01, d = 0.817) and higher testosterone (p < 0.001, d = 1.093) in the patients' group compared to controls. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between testosterone and personal distress among the patients' group (r = 0.399, p < 0.05). Opiate-addicted patients show specific impairments in emotional empathy, namely higher personal distress, which has clinical implications regarding social cognition rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The current data point toward testosterone as a possible biomarker for these sociocognitive impairments and suggest that high personal distress and high testosterone during withdrawal are possible markers for severe opiate addiction.","['Testosterone', 'empathy', 'opiate addiction', 'personal distress']",Journal of addictive diseases,2017-03-11,"[{'lastname': 'Stange', 'firstname': 'Katrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'a Center for Addiction Research (CARe) , Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hanover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krüger', 'firstname': 'Mathias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'b Department of Psychology , University of Bonn , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Janke', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'a Center for Addiction Research (CARe) , Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hanover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lichtinghagen', 'firstname': 'Ralf', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'c Institute for Clinical Chemistry , Hanover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bleich', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'a Center for Addiction Research (CARe) , Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hanover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hillemacher', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'a Center for Addiction Research (CARe) , Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hanover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heberlein', 'firstname': 'Annemarie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'a Center for Addiction Research (CARe) , Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hanover Medical School , Germany.'}]",,,,,10.1080/10550887.2017.1303980,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd509310>,,,,,,
414,28266735,Testosterone in human studies: Modest associations between plasma and salivary measurements.,"Testosterone is involved in many processes like aggression and mood disorders. As it may easily diffuse from blood into saliva, salivary testosterone is thought to reflect plasma free testosterone level. If so, it would provide a welcome noninvasive and less stressful alternative to blood sampling. Past research did not reveal consensus regarding the strength of the association, but sample sizes were small. This study aimed to analyse the association in a large cohort. In total, 2,048 participants (age range 18-65 years; 696 males and 1,352 females) were included and saliva (using cotton Salivettes) and plasma were collected for testosterone measurements. Levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoassay respectively. Free testosterone was calculated by the Vermeulen algorithm. Associations were determined using linear regression analyses. Plasma total and free testosterone showed a significant association with salivary testosterone in men (adjusted β = .09, p = .01; and β = .15, p < .001, respectively) and in women (adjusted β = .08, p = .004; and crude β = .09, p = .002 respectively). The modest associations indicate that there are many influencing factors of both technical and biological origin.","['associations', 'large cohort', 'plasma', 'saliva', 'testosterone']",Andrologia,2017-03-08,"[{'lastname': 'de Wit', 'firstname': 'A E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bosker', 'firstname': 'F J', 'initials': 'FJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Giltay', 'firstname': 'E J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Kloet', 'firstname': 'C S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, Centrum'45, Oegstgeest, The Netherlands.""}, {'lastname': 'Roelofs', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute and Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Pelt', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorium KCHI, Medisch Centrum Alkmaar, Alkmaar, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Penninx', 'firstname': 'B W J H', 'initials': 'BWJH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Schoevers', 'firstname': 'R A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.,10.1111/and.12779,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd513c70>,,,,,,

17686551",Integrating insulin-like growth factor 1 and sex hormones into neuroprotection: Implications for diabetes.,"Brain integrity and cognitive aptitude are often impaired in patients with diabetes mellitus, presumably a result of the metabolic complications inherent to the disease. However, an increasing body of evidence has demonstrated the central role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its relation to sex hormones in many neuroprotective processes. Both male and female patients with diabetes display abnormal IGF1 and sex-hormone levels but the comparison of these fluctuations is seldom a topic of interest. It is interesting to note that both IGF1 and sex hormones have the ability to regulate phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases-extracellular signal-related kinase signaling cascades in animal and cell culture models of neuroprotection. Additionally, there is considerable evidence demonstrating the neuroprotective coupling of IGF1 and estrogen. Androgens have also been implicated in many neuroprotective processes that operate on similar signaling cascades as the estrogen-IGF1 relation. Yet, androgens have not been directly linked to the brain IGF1 system and neuroprotection. Despite the sex-specific variations in brain integrity and hormone levels observed in diabetic patients, the IGF1-sex hormone relation in neuroprotection has yet to be fully substantiated in experimental models of diabetes. Taken together, there is a clear need for the comprehensive analysis of sex differences on brain integrity of diabetic patients and the relationship between IGF1 and sex hormones that may influence brain-health outcomes. As such, this review will briefly outline the basic relation of diabetes and IGF1 and its role in neuroprotection. We will also consider the findings on sex hormones and diabetes as a basis for separately analyzing males and females to identify possible hormone-induced brain abnormalities. Finally, we will introduce the neuroprotective interplay of IGF1 and estrogen and how androgen-derived neuroprotection operates through similar signaling cascades. Future research on both neuroprotection and diabetes should include androgens into the interplay of IGF1 and sex hormones.","['Androgens', 'Brain integrity', 'Cognition', 'Diabetes', 'Estrogen', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-like growth factor 1', 'Neuroprotection']",World journal of diabetes,2017-03-08,"[{'lastname': 'Huffman', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Jacob Huffman, Christina Hoffmann, George T Taylor, Behavioral Neuroscience Program, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, St. Louis, MO 63121, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoffmann', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Jacob Huffman, Christina Hoffmann, George T Taylor, Behavioral Neuroscience Program, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, St. Louis, MO 63121, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'George T', 'initials': 'GT', 'affiliation': 'Jacob Huffman, Christina Hoffmann, George T Taylor, Behavioral Neuroscience Program, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, St. Louis, MO 63121, United States.'}]",,,,,10.4239/wjd.v8.i2.45,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd51f180>,,,,,,
416,28257758,Cognition in female rats after blocking conversion of androgens to estrogens.,"Women and non-human females have surprisingly high levels of circulating testosterone, yet the effects of androgens on non-reproductive behaviors, including cognition, of females are not well characterized. The current project used an aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, to block conversion of androgens to estrogens. Adult female rats were ovariectomized and administered either vehicle only, testosterone propionate only (400μg/kg, TP only), letrozole only (1mg/kg, Letro only), or the combination of letrozole and testosterone (TP+Letro) over 4weeks. A gonadally intact group was used for comparisons. During the last 3weeks, the animals were tested for working memory in both a spatial task (radial arm maze) and a non-spatial task (object recognition). At sacrifice, uterine weights and serum testosterone and estradiol were determined. Behavioral results were the intact animals showed better working memories on the object recognition task, but that there were no differences among the ovariectomized groups. In the radial arm maze task, groups with best to worst performance were TP only>Intact=TP+Letro>vehicle=Letro only. Highest to lowest serum titers, for testosterone, were TP+Letro>TP only>Intact=Letro only>vehicle and, for estradiol, Intact>TP only>Vehicle>Letro only=TP+Letro. Our interpretation is that testosterone enhanced spatial performance when bioavailability of both TP and E2 are high, and high testosterone can rescue spatial memory when E2 bioavailability is low.","['Aromatase', 'Letrozole', 'Metabolism', 'RAM', 'Steroid', 'Working memory']",Hormones and behavior,2017-03-05,"[{'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'George T', 'initials': 'GT', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Neuroscience Program, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri - St. Louis, USA, St. Louis, MO 63121, USA; Interfakultäre Biomedizinische Forschungseinrichtung (IBF) der Universität Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Manzella', 'firstname': 'Francesca M', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Neuroscience Program, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri - St. Louis, USA, St. Louis, MO 63121, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, 660 S.

12107206",Testosterone Treatment and Cognitive Function in Older Men With Low Testosterone and Age-Associated Memory Impairment.,"Most cognitive functions decline with age. Prior studies suggest that testosterone treatment may improve these functions.
To determine if testosterone treatment compared with placebo is associated with improved verbal memory and other cognitive functions in older men with low testosterone and age-associated memory impairment (AAMI).
The Testosterone Trials (TTrials) were 7 trials to assess the efficacy of testosterone treatment in older men with low testosterone levels. The Cognitive Function Trial evaluated cognitive function in all TTrials participants. In 12 US academic medical centers, 788 men who were 65 years or older with a serum testosterone level less than 275 ng/mL and impaired sexual function, physical function, or vitality were allocated to testosterone treatment (n = 394) or placebo (n = 394). A subgroup of 493 men met criteria for AAMI based on baseline subjective memory complaints and objective memory performance. Enrollment in the TTrials began June 24, 2010; the final participant completed treatment and assessment in June 2014.
Testosterone gel (adjusted to maintain the testosterone level within the normal range for young men) or placebo gel for 1 year.
The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 6 months and 12 months for delayed paragraph recall (score range, 0 to 50) among men with AAMI. Secondary outcomes were mean changes in visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test; score range, 0 to -26), executive function (Trail-Making Test B minus A; range, -290 to 290), and spatial ability (Card Rotation Test; score range, -80 to 80) among men with AAMI. Tests were administered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.
Among the 493 men with AAMI (mean age, 72.3 years [SD, 5.8]; mean baseline testosterone, 234 ng/dL [SD, 65.1]), 247 were assigned to receive testosterone and 246 to receive placebo. Of these groups, 247 men in the testosterone group and 245 men in the placebo completed the memory study. There was no significant mean change from baseline to 6 and 12 months in delayed paragraph recall score among men with AAMI in the testosterone and placebo groups (adjusted estimated difference, -0.07 [95% CI, -0.92 to 0.79]; P = .88). Mean scores for delayed paragraph recall were 14.0 at baseline, 16.0 at 6 months, and 16.2 at 12 months in the testosterone group and 14.4 at baseline, 16.0 at 6 months, and 16.5 at 12 months in the placebo group. Testosterone was also not associated with significant differences in visual memory (-0.28 [95% CI, -0.76 to 0.19]; P = .24), executive function (-5.51 [95% CI, -12.91 to 1.88]; P = .14), or spatial ability (-0.12 [95% CI, -1.89 to 1.65]; P = .89).
Among older men with low testosterone and age-associated memory impairment, treatment with testosterone for 1 year compared with placebo was not associated with improved memory or other cognitive functions.

418,28214680,Exploring the role of testosterone in the cerebellum link to neuroticism: From adolescence to early adulthood.,"Previous research has found an association between a smaller cerebellar volume and higher levels of neuroticism. The steroid hormone testosterone reduces stress responses and the susceptibility to negative mood. Together with in vitro studies showing a positive effect of testosterone on cerebellar gray matter volumes, we set out to explore the role of testosterone in the relation between cerebellar gray matter and neuroticism. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired, and indices of neurotic personality traits were assessed by administering the depression and anxiety scale of the revised NEO personality inventory and Gray's behavioural avoidance in one hundred and forty-nine healthy volunteers between 12 and 27 years of age. Results demonstrated an inverse relation between total brain corrected cerebellar volumes and neurotic personality traits in adolescents and young adults. In males, higher endogenous testosterone levels were associated with lower scores on neurotic personality traits and larger cerebellar gray matter volumes. No such relations were observed in the female participants. Analyses showed that testosterone significantly mediated the relation between male cerebellar gray matter and measures of neuroticism. Our findings on the interrelations between endogenous testosterone, neuroticism and cerebellar morphology provide a cerebellum-oriented framework for the susceptibility to experience negative emotions and mood in adolescence and early adulthood.","['Behavioural inhibition', 'Cerebellum', 'Gray matter', 'Neuroticism', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2017-02-20,"[{'lastname': 'Schutter', 'firstname': 'Dennis J L G', 'initials': 'DJLG', 'affiliation': 'Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Montessorilaan 3, 6525 HR Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Group 1 consisted of 78 patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer who received complete ADT treatment continuously for 12 months and group 2 (control group) consisted of 78 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy without any additional treatment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) test with Turkish language version were used to evaluate multiple domains of cognitive function.
Post-treatment results of both tests revealed that patients in group 1 achieved lower mean total scores than group 2. In MoCA test, the deficits were especially prominent in the areas of language ability and short-term memory capacity (P < .05 and P < .05). No significant differences could be identified between groups in respect to attention, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, abstract thinking, calculating abilities, and orientation. In FAB test, the deficits were especially prominent in the areas of mental flexibility and inhibitory control (P < .05 and P < .05). No significant differences could be identified between groups in conceptualization, motor series, conflicting instructions, and environmental autonomy.
ADT affects cognitive functions such as language ability, short-term memory capacity, mental flexibility, and inhibitory control. Urologists should keep in mind these side effects and inform the patients and their families for the early symptoms of cognitive dysfunction.",[],Urology,2017-02-12,"[{'lastname': 'Gunlusoy', 'firstname': 'Bulent', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ceylan', 'firstname': 'Yasin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.

24367081",Sex in the brain: hormones and sex differences.,"Contrary to popular belief, sex hormones act throughout the entire brain of both males and females via both genomic and nongenomic receptors. Many neural and behavioral functions are affected by estrogens, including mood, cognitive function, blood pressure regulation, motor coordination, pain, and opioid sensitivity. Subtle sex differences exist for many of these functions that are developmentally programmed by hormones and by not yet precisely defined genetic factors, including the mitochondrial genome. These sex differences, and responses to sex hormones in brain regions and upon functions not previously regarded as subject to such differences, indicate that we are entering a new era in our ability to understand and appreciate the diversity of gender-related behaviors and brain functions.
A diferencia de la creencia popular, las hormonas sexuales actúan sobre todo el cerebro tanto de machos como de hembras mediante los receptores genómicos y no genómicos. Muchas funciones neurales y conductuales están influenciadas por los estrógenos, incluyendo el ánimo, la función cognitiva, la regulación de la presión sanguínea, la coordinación motora, el dolor y la sensibilidad a los opioides. Existen sutiles diferencias por sexo para muchas de estas funciones que están programadas a través del desarrollo por hormonas y por factores genéticos no todavía bien definidos, incluyendo el genoma mitocondrial. Estas diferencias de sexo, y las respuestas a las hormonas sexuales en regiones cerebrales y sobre funciones que antes no se consideraban sujetas a tales diferencias, indican que estamos entrando en una nueva era en nuestra capacidad para comprender y apreciar la diversidad de las conductas relacionadas con el género y las funciones cerebrales.
Contrairement à la croyance populaire, les hormones sexuelles agissent sur tout le cerveau, masculin et féminin, à travers des récepteurs génomiques et non génomiques. Les estrogènes agissent sur de nombreuses fonctions neuronales et comportementales dont l'humeur, les fonctions cognitives, la régulation de la pression artérielle, la coordination motrice, la douleur et la sensibilité aux opioïdes. Il existe des différences subtiles selon le sexe pour un grand nombre de ces fonctions dont le développement est sous dépendance hormonale et sous l'influence de facteurs génétiques non encore précisément définis, comme le génome mitochondrial. Ces différences selon le sexe et les réponses aux hormones sexuelles dans des régions cérébrales et sur des fonctions considérées auparavant comme non concernées par de telles différences, montrent qu'une nouvelle ère de compréhension et d'appréciation de la variété des comportements et des fonctions cérébrales selon le sexe s'ouvre devant nous.","['aging', 'androgen', 'depression', 'epigenetics', 'estradiol', 'hippocampus', 'memory', 'prefrontal cortex', 'progesterone', 'structural plasticity', 'synapse formation']",Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,2017-02-10,"[{'lastname': 'Marrocco', 'firstname': 'Jordan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, the Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McEwen', 'firstname': 'Bruce S', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': 'Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, the Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.'}]",,,,,10.31887/DCNS.2016.18.4/jmarrocco,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd42a040>,,,,,,

21176115",Safety Profile of Finasteride: Distribution of Adverse Effects According to Structural and Informational Dichotomies of the Mind/Brain.,"Finasteride is currently used extensively for male androgenic alopecia and benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, some adverse effects are severe and even persistent after treatment cessation, the so-called 'post-finasteride syndrome'. The following most severe adverse effects-sexual dysfunction and depression-often occur together and may potentiate one other, a fact that could explain (at least in part) the magnitude and persistence of finasteride adverse effects. This paper presents the pharmacological action of finasteride and the corresponding adverse effects, the biological base explaining the occurrence, persistence and distribution of these adverse effects, and a possible therapeutic solution for post-finasteride syndrome. The distribution of finasteride adverse effects is presented within a comprehensive and modern neuro-endocrine perspective related to structural and informational dichotomies of the brain. Understanding the variation of finasteride side effects among different populations would be necessary not only to delineate the safety profile of finasteride for different subgroups of men (a subject may or may not be affected by a certain anti-hormonal compound dependent on the individual neuro-endocrine profile), but also as a possible premise for a therapeutic approach of finasteride adverse effects. Such therapeutic approach should include administration of exogenous hormones, which are deficient in men with post-finasteride syndrome, namely dihydrotestosterone (in right-handed men) or progesterone/dihydroprogesterone (in left-handed subjects).",[],Clinical drug investigation,2017-02-06,"[{'lastname': 'Motofei', 'firstname': 'Ion G', 'initials': 'IG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Carol Davila University, Cazangiilor Street No. 10, 033063, Bucharest, Romania. igmotofei@yahoo.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Rowland', 'firstname': 'David L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, IN, 46383-6493, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Manea', 'firstname': 'Mirela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Carol Davila University, Cazangiilor Street No. 10, 033063, Bucharest, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Georgescu', 'firstname': 'Simona R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Carol Davila University, Bucharest, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Păunică', 'firstname': 'Ioana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Carol Davila University, Cazangiilor Street No. 10, 033063, Bucharest, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Sinescu', 'firstname': 'Ioanel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Carol Davila University, Bucharest, Romania.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s40261-017-0501-8,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd456d60>,,,,,,
422,28137427,Hypercaloric diet prevents sexual impairment induced by maternal food restriction.,"Prenatal undernutrition impairs copulatory behavior and increases the tendency to become obese/overweight, which also reduces sexual behavior. Re-feeding rats prenatally undernourished with a normocaloric diet can restore their physiological conditions and copulatory behavior. Thus, the present study investigated whether a hypercaloric diet that is administered in rats during the juvenile period prevents sexual impairments that are caused by maternal food restriction and the tendency to become overweight/obese. Female rats were prenatally fed a 40% restricted diet from gestational day 2 to 18. The pups received a hypercaloric diet from postnatal day (PND) 23 to PND65 (food restricted hypercaloric [FRH] group) or laboratory chow (food restricted control [FRC] group). Pups from non-food-restricted dams received laboratory chow during the entire experiment (non-food-restricted [NFR] group). During the juvenile period and adulthood, body weight gain was evaluated weekly. The day of balanopreputial separation, sexual behavior, sexual organ weight, hypodermal adiposity, striatal dopamine and serotonin, serum testosterone, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were evaluated. The FRH group exhibited an increase in body weight on PND58 and PND65. The FRC group exhibited an increase in the latency to the first mount and intromission and an increase in serum TNF-α levels but a reduction of dopaminergic activity. The hypercaloric diet reversed all of these effects but increased adiposity. We concluded that the hypercaloric diet administered during the juvenile period attenuated reproductive impairments that were induced by maternal food restriction through increases in the energy expenditure but not the tendency to become overweight/obese.","['Behavior', 'Developmental programming', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Nutrition, monoamines levels', 'Testosterone']",Physiology & behavior,2017-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bernardi', 'firstname': 'M M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Environmental and Experimental Pathology, Paulista University, UNIP, Rua Dr. Bacelar, 1212, São Paulo, SP CEP 04026-002, Brazil; Mathematics, Computing and Cognition Center, Federal University of ABC, Av. dos Estados, 5001, Santo André, SP CEP 09210-971, Brazil.

423,28088127,Cerebral laterality for language is related to adult salivary testosterone levels but not digit ratio (2D:4D) in men: A functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound study.,"The adequacy of three competing theories of hormonal effects on cerebral laterality are compared using functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD). Thirty-three adult males participated in the study (21 left-handers). Cerebral lateralization was measured by fTCD using an extensively validated word generation task. Adult salivary testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) concentrations were measured by luminescence immunoassay and prenatal T exposure was indirectly estimated by the somatic marker of 2nd to 4th digit length ratio (2D:4D). A significant quadratic relationship between degree of cerebral laterality for language and adult T concentrations was observed, with enhanced T levels for strong left hemisphere dominance and strong right hemisphere dominance. No systematic effects on laterality were found for cortisol or 2D:4D. Findings suggest that higher levels of T are associated with a relatively attenuated degree of interhemispheric sharing of linguistic information, providing support for the callosal and the sexual differentiation hypotheses rather than the Geschwind, Behan and Galaburda (GBG) hypothesis.","['2D:4D', 'Cerebral language lateralization', 'Functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD)', 'Testosterone', 'Word generation']",Brain and language,2017-01-15,"[{'lastname': 'Papadatou-Pastou', 'firstname': 'Marietta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cognition and Health Research Group, Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, 9 South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3UD, UK.

18374335",Sex-specific associations of testosterone with prefrontal-hippocampal development and executive function.,"Testosterone is thought to play a crucial role in mediating sexual differentiation of brain structures. Examinations of the cognitive effects of testosterone have also shown beneficial and potentially sex-specific effects on executive function and mnemonic processes. Yet these findings remain limited by an incomplete understanding of the critical timing and brain regions most affected by testosterone, the lack of documented links between testosterone-related structural brain changes and cognition, and the difficulty in distinguishing the effects of testosterone from those of related sex steroids such as of estradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Here we examined associations between testosterone, cortico-hippocampal structural covariance, executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) and verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version), in a longitudinal sample of typically developing children and adolescents 6-22 yo, controlling for the effects of estradiol, DHEA, pubertal stage, collection time, age, handedness, and total brain volume. We found prefrontal-hippocampal covariance to vary as a function of testosterone levels, but only in boys. Boys also showed a specific association between positive prefrontal-hippocampal covariance (as seen at higher testosterone levels) and lower performance on specific components of executive function (monitoring the action process and flexibly shifting between actions). We also found the association between testosterone and a specific aspect of executive function (monitoring) to be significantly mediated by prefrontal-hippocampal structural covariance. There were no significant associations between testosterone-related cortico-hippocampal covariance and verbal memory. Taken together, these findings highlight the developmental importance of testosterone in supporting sexual differentiation of the brain and sex-specific executive function.","['Adolescents', 'Androgen', 'Cognition', 'Gonadarche', 'Human brain', 'Puberty']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Tuong-Vi', 'initials': 'TV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Department of Obstetrics-Gynecology, McGill University Health Center (Royal Victoria Hospital at the Glen site), McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4A 3J1.

425,27981914,Serum Testosterone and Cognitive Function in Ageing Male: Updating the Evidence.,"Testosterone (T) deficit, either in prepubertal or postpubertal form of hypogonadism, seems to play a key role in impairing cognitive function, including memory, attention, language and visuospatial abilities, especially in elderly men.
Several studies have recently showed the association between low serum T levels and important cognitive dysfunctions in ageing male as well as in subjects suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and even depression, suggesting that T could exert an active neuroprotective role.
By searching PubMed and recent patents (ranging from 2010 to 2015), we identified several observational and intervention studies dealing with T and cognitive function in adult and ageing men. Findings were reviewed, thoroughly examined and, finally, summarized herein.
Although a large number of studies have been carried out so far, conclusive evidence cannot be drawn, in particular, for cognitive disorders in males.

8295951",The endocrine-brain-aging triad where many paths meet: female reproductive hormone changes at midlife and their influence on circuits important for learning and memory.,"Female mammals undergo natural fluctuations in sex steroid hormone levels throughout life. These fluctuations span from early development, to cyclic changes associated with the menstrual or estrous cycle and pregnancy, to marked hormone flux during perimenopause, and a final decline at reproductive senescence. While the transition to reproductive senescence is not yet fully understood, the vast majority of mammals experience this spontaneous, natural phenomenon with age, which has broad implications for long-lived species. Indeed, this post-reproductive life stage, and its transition, involves significant and enduring physiological changes, including considerably altered sex steroid hormone and gonadotropin profiles that impact multiple body systems, including the brain. The endocrine-brain-aging triad is especially noteworthy, as many paths meet and interact. Many of the brain regions affected by aging are also sensitive to changes in ovarian hormone levels, and aging and reproductive senescence are both associated with changes in memory performance. This review explores how menopause is related to cognitive aging, and discusses some of the key neural systems and molecular factors altered with age and reproductive hormone level changes, with an emphasis on brain regions important for learning and memory.","['Aging', 'Androgen', 'Brain', 'Cholinergic', 'Cognition', 'ERK', 'Estrogen', 'GABAergic', 'Gonadotropins', 'Hormone', 'Learning', 'Memory', 'Ovarian', 'Progesterone', 'Steroid']",Experimental gerontology,2016-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'Koebele', 'firstname': 'Stephanie V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States; Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium, Phoenix, AZ 85006, United States.""}, {'lastname': 'Bimonte-Nelson', 'firstname': 'Heather A', 'initials': 'HA', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States; Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium, Phoenix, AZ 85006, United States.

22224834",Brain connectivity aberrations in anabolic-androgenic steroid users.,"Sustained anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use has adverse behavioral consequences, including aggression, violence and impulsivity. Candidate mechanisms include disruptions of brain networks with high concentrations of androgen receptors and critically involved in emotional and cognitive regulation. Here, we tested the effects of AAS on resting-state functional brain connectivity in the largest sample of AAS-users to date. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 151 males engaged in heavy resistance strength training. 50 users tested positive for AAS based on the testosterone to epitestosterone (T/E) ratio and doping substances in urine. 16 previous users and 59 controls tested negative. We estimated brain network nodes and their time-series using ICA and dual regression and defined connectivity matrices as the between-node partial correlations. In line with the emotional and behavioral consequences of AAS, current users exhibited reduced functional connectivity between key nodes involved in emotional and cognitive regulation, in particular reduced connectivity between the amygdala and default-mode network (DMN) and between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and a frontal node encompassing the superior and inferior frontal gyri (SFG/IFG) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with further reductions as a function of dependency, lifetime exposure, and cycle state (on/off).","['Amygdala', 'Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS)', 'Default-mode network', 'Dependency', 'Functional connectivity', 'fMRI']",NeuroImage.

Here, we present the most important recent findings from empirical studies and reviews that have focused on the effects of hormone therapy on cognitive functioning in breast and prostate cancer populations, underline some general shortcomings, and propose directions for future research.
Recent research indicates that cognitive impairment may occur in breast and prostate cancer patients following onset of hormone therapy. However, because of methodological shortcomings and heterogeneity of current research, conclusions regarding the effects of hormone therapy on cognitive functions remain tentative.
The review highlights the general findings while also describing the many methodological shortcomings that need to be addressed in future research. It is clear that larger scale neuropsychological studies that also evaluate the impact of impairments on daily life functioning will improve our understanding of the effects of hormone therapy on cognition and inform the development of appropriate interventions.",[],Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,2016-12-08,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Lisa M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'aDepartment of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA bUnit for Psycho-oncology and Health Psychology, Department of Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital cDepartment of Psychology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Amidi', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.1097/SPC.0000000000000251

25032478",Hormone replacement therapy in young women with primary ovarian insufficiency and early menopause.,"Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a rare but important cause of ovarian hormone deficiency and infertility in women. In addition to causing infertility, POI is associated with multiple health risks, including bothersome menopausal symptoms, decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures, early progression of cardiovascular disease, psychologic impact that may include depression, anxiety, and decreased perceived psychosocial support, potential early decline in cognition, and dry eye syndrome. Appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to replace premenopausal levels of ovarian sex steroids is paramount to increasing quality of life for women with POI and ameliorating associated health risks. In this review, we discuss POI and complications associated with this disorder, as well as safe and effective HRT options. To decrease morbidity associated with POI, we recommend using HRT formulations that most closely mimic normal ovarian hormone production and continuing HRT until the normal age of natural menopause, ∼50 years. We address special populations of women with POI, including women with Turner syndrome, women with increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer, women approaching the age of natural menopause, and breastfeeding women.","['Primary ovarian insufficiency', 'androgen', 'early menopause', 'estrogen', 'hormone replacement therapy', 'management', 'menopausal hormone therapy', 'morbidity', 'mortality', 'premature menopause', 'premature ovarian failure', 'progestin']",Fertility and sterility,2016-12-04,"[{'lastname': 'Sullivan', 'firstname': 'Shannon D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sarrel', 'firstname': 'Philip M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences and Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'Lawrence M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Intramural Research Program, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.

19620821",Association between dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and attention in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with only chemotherapy.,"Long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for neurocognitive impairment, as well as compromised hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) is an adrenal androgen commonly used as a marker of HPA function. In the general population, a low level of DHEAS has been associated with poorer cognition. At ≥2years post-treatment, we examined the association of DHEAS with attention outcomes in 35 male and 34 female long-term survivors of childhood ALL (mean[standard deviation] age at evaluation 14.5[4.7] years; 7.5[1.9] years post-diagnosis) who were treated with only chemotherapy and without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Male survivors with low-normal levels of DHEAS had worse performance than male survivors with high levels of DHEAS on multiple measures of attention (all P's<0.05). However, association between DHEAS and attention measures were not found in female survivors. Our results suggest that survivors of ALL who suffer from partial but persistent adrenal insufficiency may be at risk for neurocognitive deficits. This finding should be validated in a larger prospective study, with attention to sex differences in the potential impact of adrenal insufficiency on neurocognitive outcomes.","['Attention', 'Chemotherapy', 'Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate', 'Neurocognitive function']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-12-03,"[{'lastname': 'Cheung', 'firstname': 'Yin Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Chemaitilly', 'firstname': 'Wassim', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Department of Endocrinology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Mulrooney', 'firstname': 'Daniel A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA; Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Brinkman', 'firstname': 'Tara M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA; Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Banerjee', 'firstname': 'Pia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Srivastava', 'firstname': 'Deokumar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Pui', 'firstname': 'Ching-Hon', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Robison', 'firstname': 'Leslie L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Hudson', 'firstname': 'Melissa M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA; Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Krull', 'firstname': 'Kevin R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA; Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA.

432,27872000,Is Testosterone a Food for the Brain?,"Testosterone is fundamental for psychological, sexological, cognitive, and reproductive aspects, and its lack or reduction largely impacts the quality of life in males and females.
Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the role of testosterone in the neurophysiology of the brain and related aspects regarding the quality of general and sexual life.
We listed and discussed the principal studies on the role of testosterone in the brain regarding sexual health, psychopathological conditions, and the elderly. The search strategies were composed by the insertion of specific terms in PubMed regarding the main studies from January 2000 to June 2015.
Using a psychoneuroendocrinologic perspective, we considered 4 main sections: brain and testosterone, sexuality and testosterone, psychopathology and testosterone, and cognitive impairment and testosterone.
Much evidence on the neuroendocrinology of testosterone regarding brain activity, sexual function, psychological health, and senescence was found. In any case, it is known that testosterone deficiency negatively impacts quality of life, first, but not exclusively, through a central effect. Moreover, testosterone and androgen receptors are differently expressed according to age and gender. This aspect contributes to gender differences and to the dimorphic physiological role of this hormone.
A universal role for testosterone can be recognized: low levels of testosterone are associated with mental disorders, sexual dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in both sexes. Hence, physicians should carefully assess testosterone levels, not only in the management of sexual dysfunctions but also when seeking to help patients with severe mental or organic diseases.","['Brain', 'Elderly', 'Psychopathology', 'Sexuality', 'Testosterone', 'Testosterone Replacement Therapy']",Sexual medicine reviews,2016-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Ciocca', 'firstname': 'Giacomo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Limoncin', 'firstname': 'Erika', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Carosa', 'firstname': 'Eleonora', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Di Sante', 'firstname': 'Stefania', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gravina', 'firstname': 'Giovanni L', 'initials': 'GL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Mollaioli', 'firstname': 'Daniele', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Gianfrilli', 'firstname': 'Daniele', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lenzi', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Jannini', 'firstname': 'Emmanuele A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Systems Medicine, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy.

433,27855417,Testosterone Deficiency and Testosterone Treatment in Older Men.,"Frailty is a clinical condition related to changes in metabolism, to sarcopenia, and to decline in muscle mass and strength, bone mineral density, and physical function with aging. The pathophysiology of frailty is multifactorial and associated with comorbidities. Testosterone is implicated in regulating metabolic functions, maintenance of muscle and bone, and inhibition of adipogenesis. In older individuals, reduced testosterone is thought to contribute to an altered state of metabolism, loss of muscle and bone, and increased fat, leading to sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and frailty. While no direct relationship between testosterone deficiency (commonly known as hypogonadism) and frailty has been established (due to the multifactorial nature of frailty), clinical evidence suggests that testosterone deficiency is associated with increased sarcopenia and obesity. Testosterone treatment in frail older men with limited mobility and with testosterone deficiency improved insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, and body composition. These changes contribute to better physical function and improved quality of life. Because frailty increases disability, comorbidities, and the risk of hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortality in older men, it is warranted to explore the potential usefulness of testosterone treatment in frail men with hypogonadism in order to attenuate the progression of sarcopenia and frailty. In this paper, we will discuss the impact of testosterone deficiency on frailty and the potential role of testosterone treatment in ameliorating and reducing the progression of frailty. Such an approach may reduce disability and the risk of hospitalization and increase functional independence and quality of life.",[],Gerontology,2016-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Saad', 'firstname': 'Farid', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Global Medical Affairs Andrology, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Röhrig', 'firstname': 'Gabriele', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'von Haehling', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Traish', 'firstname': 'Abdulmaged', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"© 2016 S.

10325223",Spatial memory is impaired by peripubertal GnRH agonist treatment and testosterone replacement in sheep.,"Chronic gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is used therapeutically to block activity within the reproductive axis through down-regulation of GnRH receptors within the pituitary gland. GnRH receptors are also expressed in non-reproductive tissues, including areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and amygdala. The impact of long-term GnRHa-treatment on hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions, such as spatial orientation, learning and memory, is not well studied, particularly when treatment encompasses a critical window of development such as puberty. The current study used an ovine model to assess spatial maze performance and memory of rams that were untreated (Controls), had both GnRH and testosterone signaling blocked (GnRHa-treated), or specifically had GnRH signaling blocked (GnRHa-treated with testosterone replacement) during the peripubertal period (8, 27 and 41 weeks of age). The results demonstrate that emotional reactivity during spatial tasks was compromised by the blockade of gonadal steroid signaling, as seen by the restorative effects of testosterone replacement, while traverse times remained unchanged during assessment of spatial orientation and learning. The blockade of GnRH signaling alone was associated with impaired retention of long-term spatial memory and this effect was not restored with the replacement of testosterone signaling. These results indicate that GnRH signaling is involved in the retention and recollection of spatial information, potentially via alterations to spatial reference memory, and that therapeutic medical treatments using chronic GnRHa may have effects on this aspect of cognitive function.","['Gender dysphoria', 'GnRH', 'Hippocampus', 'Puberty', 'Spatial memory', 'Spatial orientation']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Hough', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biodiversity Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bellingham', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biodiversity Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Haraldsen', 'firstname': 'I R H', 'initials': 'IRH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Neurobiology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Oslo University Hospital - Rikshospitalet, 0027, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'McLaughlin', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Veterinary Bioscience and Education, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rennie', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biodiversity Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Robinson', 'firstname': 'J E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biodiversity Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Solbakk', 'firstname': 'A K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Neurobiology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Oslo University Hospital - Rikshospitalet, 0027, Oslo, Norway; Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Pb 1094 Blindern, 0317 Oslo, Norway; Department of Neuropsychology, Helgeland Hospital, Mosjøen, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'N P', 'initials': 'NP', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biodiversity Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.

435,27692845,Psychometric Evaluation of the Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire.,"The Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire (HIS-Q) is a patient-reported outcome measurement designed to comprehensively evaluate the symptoms of hypogonadism and to detect changes in these symptoms in response to treatment.
To conduct item analysis and reduction, evaluate the psychometric properties of the HIS-Q, and provide guidance on interpreting the instrument score.
A 12-week observational, longitudinal study of hypogonadal men was conducted. Participants completed the HIS-Q every 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected to evaluate testosterone levels. Participants also completed the Aging Male's Symptoms Scale, the International Index of Erectile Function, the Short Form-12 Health Survey, and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sexual Activity, Satisfaction with Sex Life, Sleep Disturbance, and Applied Cognition Scales (at baseline and weeks 6 and 12). Clinicians completed the Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Change measurements and a clinical form.
Individual item performance was evaluated using descriptive statistics and Rasch analyses. Reliability (internal consistency and test-retest), validity (concurrent and know groups), and responsiveness were assessed.
In total, 177 men participated in the study (mean age = 54.1 years, range = 23-83). The original 53-item draft HIS-Q was reduced to 28 items; the final instrument included five domains (sexual, energy, sleep, cognition, and mood) with two sexual subdomains (libido and sexual function). For all domains, test-retest reliability was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.70), construct validity was good (|r > 0.30| for all comparisons). Known-groups validity was demonstrated for all HIS-Q domain scores, subdomain scores, and the total score as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Severity, and total testosterone level at baseline (P < .05 for all comparisons). All domains and subdomains were responsive to change based on patient-rated anchor questions (P < .05 for all comparisons).

We investigated whether adolescent girls with gender dysphoria (GD), before and after 10 months of testosterone treatment, showed male-typical brain activity during a mental rotation task (MRT).
Girls with GD underwent fMRI while performing the MRT twice: when receiving medication to suppress their endogenous sex hormones before onset of testosterone treatment, and 10 months later during testosterone treatment. Two age-matched control groups participated twice as well.
We included 21 girls with GD, 20 male controls and 21 female controls in our study. In the absence of any group differences in performance, control girls showed significantly increased activation in frontal brain areas compared with control boys (
Since all girls with GD identified as gynephilic, their resemblance in spatial cognition with the control boys, who were also gynephilic, may have been related to their shared sexual orientation rather than their shared gender identity. We did not account for menstrual cycle phase or contraceptive use in our analyses.
Our findings suggest atypical sexual differentiation of the brain in natal girls with GD and provide new evidence for organizational and activational effects of testosterone on visuospatial cognitive functioning.",[],Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN,2016-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Burke', 'firstname': 'Sarah M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': ""From the Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria, Department of Medical Psychology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Burke, Kreukels, Cohen-Kettenis, Bakker);

437,27744092,Subcortical gray matter changes in transgender subjects after long-term cross-sex hormone administration.,"Sex-steroid hormones are primarily involved in sexual differentiation and development and are thought to underlie processes related to cognition and emotion. However, divergent results have been reported concerning the effects of hormone administration on brain structure including side effects like brain atrophy and dementia. Cross-sex hormone therapy in transgender subjects offers a unique model for studying the effects of sex hormones on the living human brain. In this study, 25 Female-to-Male (FtM) and 14 Male-to-Female (MtF) subjects underwent MRI examinations at baseline and after a period of at least 4-months of continuous cross-sex hormone administration. While MtFs received estradiol and anti-androgens, FtM subjects underwent high-dose testosterone treatment. The longitudinal processing stream of the FreeSurfer software suite was used for the automated assessment and delineation of brain volumes to assess the structural changes over the treatment period of cross-sex hormone administration. Most prominent results were found for MtFs receiving estradiol and anti-androgens in the form of significant decreases in the hippocampal region. Further analysis revealed that these decreases were reflected by increases in the ventricles. Additionally, changes in progesterone levels correlated with changes in gray matter structures in MtF subjects. In line with prior studies, our results indicate hormonal influences on subcortical structures related to memory and emotional processing. Additionally, this study adds valuable knowledge that progesterone may play an important role in this process.","['Gray matter volume', 'Hormone therapy', 'Hormones', 'Transgender', 'Transsexuals']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Seiger', 'firstname': 'Rene', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hahn', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hummer', 'firstname': 'Allan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'MR Centre of Excellence, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kranz', 'firstname': 'Georg S', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Ganger', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Woletz', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'MR Centre of Excellence, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kraus', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Sladky', 'firstname': 'Ronald', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'MR Centre of Excellence, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kautzky', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kasper', 'firstname': 'Siegfried', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Windischberger', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'MR Centre of Excellence, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanzenberger', 'firstname': 'Rupert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.

19880786",Effects of Testosterone Therapy on Cognitive Function in Aging: A Systematic Review.,"Endogenous testosterone in the aging man has been scrutinized extensively in regard to its effects on performance in many cognitive domains, especially verbal fluency, visuospatial and visuoperceptual abilities, memory, and executive function. Studies of testosterone supplementation have sought to identify potential cognitive improvements in men with and without baseline cognitive impairment, and have had a wide range of results. The variability in outcomes is likely related, in part, to the lack of consensus on methods for testosterone measurement and supplementation and, in part, to the disparate measures of cognitive function used in randomized controlled studies. Despite the limitations imposed by such inconsistent methods, promising associations have been found between cognition and testosterone supplementation in both eugonadal men and men with low testosterone levels, with and without baseline cognitive dysfunction. This systematic review highlights the cognitive measures used in and the outcomes of existing studies of testosterone and cognition in aging men. The review suggests that larger studies and a more standardized approach to assessment will be needed before we can fully understand and realize sustained benefits from testosterone supplementation in the elderly male population, particularly given the substantial increase in testosterone supplementation in clinical practice.",[],Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,2016-09-24,"[{'lastname': 'Hua', 'firstname': 'Jeremy T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Departments of *Neurology †Medicine ‡Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.'}, {'lastname': 'Hildreth', 'firstname': 'Kerry L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pelak', 'firstname': 'Victoria S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000104,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd221770>,,,,,,

To determine whether these persistent symptoms after discontinuation of finasteride use are due to androgen deficiency, decreased peripheral androgen action, or persistent inhibition of steroid 5α-reductase (SRD5A) enzymes.
Finasteride users, who reported persistent sexual symptoms after discontinuing finasteride (group 1); age-matched finasteride users who did not report sexual symptoms (group 2); and healthy men who had never used finasteride (group 3).
Sexual function, mood, affect, cognition, hormone levels, body composition, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to sexually and affectively valenced stimuli, nucleotide sequences of androgen receptor (AR), SRD5A1, and SRD5A2; expression levels of androgen-dependent genes in skin.
Academic medical center.
Symptomatic finasteride users were similar in body composition, strength, and nucleotide sequences of AR, SRD5A1, and SRD5A2 genes to asymptomatic finasteride users and nonusers. Symptomatic finasteride users had impaired sexual function, higher depression scores, a more negative affectivity balance, and more cognitive complaints than men in groups 2 and 3 but had normal objectively assessed cognitive function. Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol-glucuronide, testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and androsterone glucuronide to etiocholanolone glucuronide ratios, and markers of peripheral androgen action and expression levels of AR-dependent genes in skin did not differ among groups. fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent responses to erotic and nonerotic stimuli revealed abnormal function in brain circuitry linked to sexual arousal and major depression.
We found no evidence of androgen deficiency, decreased peripheral androgen action, or persistent peripheral inhibition of SRD5A in men with persistent sexual symptoms after finasteride use. Symptomatic finasteride users revealed depressed mood and fMRI findings consistent with those observed in depression.",[],The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2016-09-24,"[{'lastname': 'Basaria', 'firstname': 'Shehzad', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Research Program in Men's Health: Aging and Metabolism (S.Ba., R.K., G.H., K.P., Z.L., C.S., A.P., T.W.S., S.Bh.), Harvard Medical School, Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory (H.P., E.S.), Department of Radiology, and Section of Urology (M.O.), Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115;

440,27647279,Oxytocin Modulates Semantic Integration in Speech Comprehension.,"Listeners interpret utterances by integrating information from multiple sources including word level semantics and world knowledge. When the semantics of an expression is inconsistent with their knowledge about the world, the listener may have to search through the conceptual space for alternative possible world scenarios that can make the expression more acceptable. Such cognitive exploration requires considerable computational resources and might depend on motivational factors. This study explores whether and how oxytocin, a neuropeptide known to influence social motivation by reducing social anxiety and enhancing affiliative tendencies, can modulate the integration of world knowledge and sentence meanings. The study used a between-participant double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design. Semantic integration, indexed with magnetoencephalography through the N400m marker, was quantified while 45 healthy male participants listened to sentences that were either congruent or incongruent with facts of the world, after receiving intranasally delivered oxytocin or placebo. Compared with congruent sentences, world knowledge incongruent sentences elicited a stronger N400m signal from the left inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions and medial pFC (the N400m effect) in the placebo group. Oxytocin administration significantly attenuated the N400m effect at both sensor and cortical source levels throughout the experiment, in a state-like manner. Additional electrophysiological markers suggest that the absence of the N400m effect in the oxytocin group is unlikely due to the lack of early sensory or semantic processing or a general downregulation of attention. These findings suggest that oxytocin drives listeners to resolve challenges of semantic integration, possibly by promoting the cognitive exploration of alternative possible world scenarios.",[],Journal of cognitive neuroscience,2016-09-21,"[{'lastname': 'Ye', 'firstname': 'Zheng', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Radboud University Nijmegen.\nChinese Academy of Sciences.'}, {'lastname': 'Stolk', 'firstname': 'Arjen', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Radboud University Nijmegen.'}, {'lastname': 'Toni', 'firstname': 'Ivan', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Radboud University Nijmegen.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagoort', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Radboud University Nijmegen.\nMax Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.'}]",,,,,10.1162/jocn_a_01044,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd1e7860>,,,,,,
441,27616036,Structural Brain Imaging of Long-Term Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Users and Nonusing Weightlifters.,"Prolonged high-dose anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits, yet we have almost no knowledge of the long-term consequences of AAS use on the brain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between long-term AAS exposure and brain morphometry, including subcortical neuroanatomical volumes and regional cortical thickness.
Male AAS users and weightlifters with no experience with AASs or any other equivalent doping substances underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain. The current paper is based upon high-resolution structural T1-weighted images from 82 current or past AAS users exceeding 1 year of cumulative AAS use and 68 non-AAS-using weightlifters. Images were processed with the FreeSurfer software to compare neuroanatomical volumes and cerebral cortical thickness between the groups.
Compared to non-AAS-using weightlifters, the AAS group had thinner cortex in widespread regions and significantly smaller neuroanatomical volumes, including total gray matter, cerebral cortex, and putamen. Both volumetric and thickness effects remained relatively stable across different AAS subsamples comprising various degrees of exposure to AASs and also when excluding participants with previous and current non-AAS drug abuse. The effects could not be explained by differences in verbal IQ, intracranial volume, anxiety/depression, or attention or behavioral problems.
This large-scale systematic investigation of AAS use on brain structure shows negative correlations between AAS use and brain volume and cortical thickness. Although the findings are correlational, they may serve to raise concern about the long-term consequences of AAS use on structural features of the brain.","['Anabolic-androgenic steroids', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cortical thinning', 'Gray matter', 'Neuroimaging', 'Putamen']",Biological psychiatry,2016-09-13,"[{'lastname': 'Bjørnebekk', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Unit of Neuropsychology, Oslo, Norway; National Advisory Unit on Substance Use Disorder Treatment, Oslo, Norway.

443,27599230,Effects of testosterone on synaptic plasticity mediated by androgen receptors in male SAMP8 mice.,"Synaptic changes are closely associated with cognitive deficits. In addition, testosterone (T) is known to exert regulative effects on synaptic plasticity. T may improve cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but the underlying mechanisms of androgenic action on cognitive performance remain unclear. The aim of this study was thus to examine the protective mechanism attributed to T on cognitive performance in an AD senescence, accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) animal model. Using Golgi staining to quantify the dendritic spine density in hippocampal CA1 region, molecular biomarkers of synapse function were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and western blot. T significantly increased the dendritic spine density in hippocampal CA1 region, while flutamide (F) inhibited these T-mediated effects. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), and p-cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB)/CREB levels were significantly elevated in the T group, but F reduced the T-induced effects in these biomarkers to control levels. There were no significant differences in the expression levels of PSD-95, BDNF, and p-CREB/CREB between C and F. These findings indicate that the effects of T on improvement in synaptic plasticity were mediated via androgen receptor (AR). It is conceivable that new treatments targeted toward preventing synaptic pathology in AD may involve the use of androgen-acting drugs.",[],Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Given that treatment has to be started before the genotype is known, 7 out of 8 fetuses will be exposed to DEX without benefit.
To evaluate long-term cognitive effects of prenatal DEX therapy in healthy (non-CAH) DEX-treated children.
Observational study with patient and control groups from a single research institute.
Healthy (non-CAH) DEX-treated subjects (n = 34) and untreated population controls (n = 66) from Sweden, aged 7-17 years.
DEX-treatment used in unborn children at risk of CAH, during first trimester of fetal life.
Standardized neuropsychological tests and questionnaires were used.
DEX treatment has widespread negative effects in girls. In Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-III scale subtests, we observed significant interactions between DEX and GENDER (coding, P = .044; block design, P = .013; vocabulary, P = .025) and a trend for the subtest digit span (P = .074). All interactions were driven by DEX effects in girls, but not boys, with DEX-treated females showing lower scores than female untreated controls (coding, P = .068, d = 0.66; block design, P = .021, d = 0.81; vocabulary, P = .014, d = 0.84; digit span, P = .001, d = 1.0). Likewise, DEX-treated girls tend to have poorer visual spatial working memory performance than controls (span board test forward: P = .065, d = .80). We observed no effects on long-term memory, handedness, speed of processing, nor self-perceived or parentally reported scholastic performance.
Early prenatal DEX exposure affects cognitive functions in healthy girls, ie, children who do not benefit from the treatment.

448,27459586,"Higher sexual interest with androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy than with castration plus an androgen receptor inhibitor in prostate cancer patients treated with curative radiotherapy, but otherwise small health-related quality of life differences: A randomised prospective 18-month follow-up study.","To prospectively study differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with localised/locally advanced prostate cancer (PC) treated with curative intended radiation therapy and randomised to androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy treatment versus castration plus an androgen receptor inhibitor used continuously. Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) relapse, time to symptomatic metastasis and overall survival (OS) were also described for the two groups.
From 2005 to 2011, a total of 110 patients were randomised at a ratio of 1:1. HRQoL was assessed at six time points: before randomisation, before radiotherapy (RT) start and 9, 12, 15 and 18 months after randomisation, using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ-PR25.
At the 3-month follow-up, statistically significant differences between the two groups were found for overall quality of life (p = 0.006), fatigue (p = 0.023), sexual interest (p < 0.001) and urinary problems (p = 0.036). Small clinical differences were noted for overall quality of life, role functioning, fatigue, pain, sleeping problems and urinary problems. At that assessment point, clinical differences between the groups were substantial regarding sexual interest and moderate regarding sexual functioning (the latter indicated only by patients reporting having sexual interest at baseline). All statistical and clinical differences favoured the androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy arm. At 18 months after randomisation, statistically significant differences were found for cognitive functioning (p = 0.040) and sexual interest (p = 0.011), both favouring the androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy arm.
The results suggest that neo-adjuvant androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy might be preferred compared to castration plus an androgen receptor inhibitor before curative intended RT in men with localised/locally advanced PC, with higher levels of HRQoL, especially concerning sexual interest. HRQoL differences over time were small. The observation time and study sample were too small for evaluating time to PSA progression and OS. Further studies are needed to confirm the results.

These may be affected by other risk factors including metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus, dietary habits and apolipoprotein E genotypes. Furthermore, cognitive function could be modulated by sex hormones such as estrogen and androgen via their anti-oxidative, neuro-protective and vasoprotective effects. Contrary to the results from basic research and observational studies, clinical trials on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been controversial. Overall, HRT with estrogen plus progesterone in older women seemed to increase the risk of dementia. In contrast, testosterone replacement in older men and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) replacement older women may have potential protective effects on cognitive function, although clinical evidence is insufficient at present.",[],Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,2016-07-11,"[{'lastname': 'Umeda-Kameyama', 'firstname': 'Yumi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, The University of Tokyo.'}, {'lastname': 'Akishita', 'firstname': 'Masahiro', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.11477/mf.1416200499,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd164e50>,,,,,,
450,27381928,Effects of two dominance manipulations on the stress response: Cognitive and embodied influences.,"In response to stress, physiological and mental resources are allocated towards those systems that are needed for rapid responding in terms of fight or flight. On the other hand, long term regenerative processes such as growth, digestion and reproduction are attenuated. Levels of the sex steroid testosterone are reduced in participants that suffer from chronic stress. However, beyond its role for reproductive functions, testosterone plays an important role in the regulation of social status and dominance, testosterone levels increase during competition or when the social status is challenged. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a laboratory stressor with a substantial social-evaluative component, can provoke an increase in salivary testosterone levels. Still, so far the reported findings regarding acute stress effects on testosterone are equivocal, possibly due to moderating effects. In this study we experimentally manipulated social dominance in 56 healthy participants (28m) by two independent manipulations (body posture and cognitive role taking) and subjected them to the TSST. We analyzed salivary testosterone and cortisol levels as dependent measures for the endocrine stress response. The role taking manipulation interacted with the testosterone response: we found the strongest increase when participants had to put themselves in a dominant (vs. submissive) role. Our results suggest that transient changes in testosterone levels during stress reflect a response to status threat that is affected by social dominance.","['Cortisol', 'Social dominance', 'Stress response', 'Testosterone', 'Trier Social Stress Test']",Biological psychology,2016-07-07,"[{'lastname': 'Deuter', 'firstname': 'Christian Eric', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charité University Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.

451,27377542,"Effects of long-term testosterone administration on cognition in older men with low or low-to-normal testosterone concentrations: a prespecified secondary analysis of data from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled TEAAM trial.","The effects of testosterone on cognitive function in older men are incompletely understood. We aimed to establish the effects of long-term testosterone administration on multiple domains of cognitive function in older men with low or low-to-normal testosterone concentrations.
We did the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group TEAAM trial at three medical centres in Boston, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, USA. Men aged 60 years and older with low or low-to-normal testosterone concentrations (3·47-13·9 nmol/L, or free testosterone <173 pmol/L) were randomly assigned (1:1), via computer-generated randomisation, to receive either 7·5 g of 1% testosterone gel or placebo gel daily for 3 years. Randomisation was stratified by age (60-75 years vs >75 years) and study site. The testosterone dose was adjusted to achieve concentrations of 17·3-31·2 nmol/L. Participants and all study personnel were masked to treatment allocation. Multiple domains of cognitive function were assessed as prespecified secondary outcomes by use of standardised tests at baseline and months 6, 18, and 36. We did analyses by intention to treat (in men who had baseline assessments of cognitive function) and per protocol (restricted to participants who completed the study drug and had both baseline and 36 month assessments of cognitive function). The TEAAM trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00287586.
Between Sept 1, 2004, and Feb 12, 2009, we randomly assigned 308 participants to receive either testosterone (n=156) or placebo (n=152). 280 men had baseline cognitive assessments (n=140 per group). Mean follow-up time was 29·0 months (SD 11·5) in the testosterone group and 31·1 months (9·5) in the placebo group. The last participant completed the study on May 11, 2012. In the testosterone group, mean concentrations of serum total testosterone increased from 10·6 nmol/L (SD 2·2) to 19·7 nmol/L (9·2) and free testosterone concentrations increased from 222 pmol/L (62) to 364 pmol/L (222). In the placebo group, mean concentrations of serum total testosterone were 10·7 nmol/L (SD 2·3) at baseline and 11·1 nmol/L (3·2) post-intervention and free testosterone concentrations were 210 pmol/L (61) and 172 pmol/L (49), respectively. We recorded no between-group differences in changes in visuospatial ability (mean difference: Complex Figure Test -0·51, 95% CI -2·0 to 1·0), phonemic or category verbal fluency (phonemic fluency test 0·90, -1·3 to 3·1; categorical fluency test 1·1, -0·3 to 2·6), verbal memory (paragraph recall test 0·29, -1·2 to 1·8), manual dexterity (Grooved Pegboard Test 4·2, -1·3 to 9·7), and attention or executive function (Stroop Interference Test -2·6, -7·4 to 2·3) after adjustment for age, education, and baseline cognitive function. In both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol (n=86 per group) populations, changes in cognitive function scores were not related significantly to changes in total or free testosterone, or oestradiol concentrations.
Testosterone administration for 36 months in older men with low or low-to-normal testosterone concentrations did not improve cognitive function. Future long-term trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of testosterone replacement in patients with impaired cognition, such as people with Alzheimer's disease.

2348190",Lasting Adaptations in Social Behavior Produced by Social Disruption and Inhibition of Adult Neurogenesis.,"Research on social instability has focused on its detrimental consequences, but most people are resilient and respond by invoking various coping strategies. To investigate cellular processes underlying such strategies, a dominance hierarchy of rats was formed and then destabilized. Regardless of social position, rats from disrupted hierarchies had fewer new neurons in the hippocampus compared with rats from control cages and those from stable hierarchies. Social disruption produced a preference for familiar over novel conspecifics, a change that did not involve global memory impairments or increased anxiety. Using the neuropeptide oxytocin as a tool to increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus of disrupted rats restored preference for novel conspecifics to predisruption levels. Conversely, reducing the number of new neurons by limited inhibition of adult neurogenesis in naive transgenic GFAP-thymidine kinase rats resulted in social behavior similar to disrupted rats. Together, these results provide novel mechanistic evidence that social disruption shapes behavior in a potentially adaptive way, possibly by reducing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
To investigate cellular processes underlying adaptation to social instability, a dominance hierarchy of rats was formed and then destabilized. Regardless of social position, rats from disrupted hierarchies had fewer new neurons in the hippocampus compared with rats from control cages and those from stable hierarchies. Unexpectedly, these changes were accompanied by changes in social strategies without evidence of impairments in cognition or anxiety regulation. Restoring adult neurogenesis in disrupted rats using oxytocin and conditionally suppressing the production of new neurons in socially naive GFAP-thymidine kinase rats showed that loss of 6-week-old neurons may be responsible for adaptive changes in social behavior.","['GFAP-TK transgenic rats', 'dominance hierarchy', 'hippocampus', 'neurogenesis', 'oxytocin', 'social behavior']",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2016-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Opendak', 'firstname': 'Maya', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Princeton Neuroscience Institute and.'}, {'lastname': 'Offit', 'firstname': 'Lily', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, and.'}, {'lastname': 'Monari', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, and.'}, {'lastname': 'Schoenfeld', 'firstname': 'Timothy J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.'}, {'lastname': 'Sonti', 'firstname': 'Anup N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.'}, {'lastname': 'Cameron', 'firstname': 'Heather A', 'initials': 'HA', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.'}, {'lastname': 'Gould', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, and goulde@princeton.edu.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/367027-12$15.00/0.,"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4435-15.2016

453,27347894,Sex Hormones and Cognition: Neuroendocrine Influences on Memory and Learning.,"Sex differences in neurological disease exist in incidence, severity, progression, and symptoms and may ultimately influence treatment. Cognitive disturbances are frequent in neuropsychiatric disease with men showing greater cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, but women showing more severe dementia and cognitive decline with Alzheimer's disease. Although there are no overall differences in intelligence between the sexes, men, and women demonstrate slight but consistent differences in a number of cognitive domains. These include a male advantage, on average, in some types of spatial abilities and a female advantage on some measures of verbal fluency and memory. Sex differences in traits or behaviors generally indicate the involvement of sex hormones, such as androgens and estrogens. We review the literature on whether adult levels of testosterone and estradiol influence spatial ability in both males and females from rodent models to humans. We also include information on estrogens and their ability to modulate verbal memory in men and women. Estrone and progestins are common components of hormone therapies, and we also review the existing literature concerning their effects on cognition. We also review the sex differences in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as they relate to cognitive performance in both rodents and humans. There has been greater recognition in the scientific literature that it is important to study both sexes and also to analyze study findings with sex as a variable. Only by examining these sex differences can we progress to finding treatments that will improve the cognitive health of both men and women. © 2016 American Physiological Society.

18374335","Expansion of mossy fibers and CA3 apical dendritic length accompanies the fall in dendritic spine density after gonadectomy in male, but not female, rats.","Androgen loss is an important clinical concern because of its cognitive and behavioral effects. Changes in androgen levels are also suspected to contribute to neurological disease. However, the available data on the effects of androgen deprivation in areas of the brain that are central to cognition, like the hippocampus, are mixed. In this study, morphological analysis of pyramidal cells was used to investigate if structural changes could potentially contribute to the mixed cognitive effects that have been observed after androgen loss in males. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orchidectomized or sham-operated. Two months later, their brains were Golgi-impregnated for morphological analysis. Morphological endpoints were studied in areas CA3 and CA1, with comparisons to females either intact or 2 months after ovariectomy. CA3 pyramidal neurons of orchidectomized rats exhibited marked increases in apical dendritic arborization. There were increases in mossy fiber afferent density in area CA3, as well as robust enhancements to dendritic structure in area CA3 of orchidectomized males, but not in CA1. Remarkably, apical dendritic length of CA3 pyramidal cells increased, while spine density declined. By contrast, in females overall dendritic structure was minimally affected by ovariectomy, while dendritic spine density was greatly reduced. Sex differences and subfield-specific effects of gonadal hormone deprivation on the hippocampal circuitry may help explain the different behavioral effects reported in males and females after gonadectomy, or other conditions associated with declining gonadal hormone secretion.","['Androgen', 'Dendritic spines', 'Gonadectomy', 'Hippocampus', 'Mossy fibers', 'Sex differences']",Brain structure & function,2016-06-11,"[{'lastname': 'Mendell', 'firstname': 'Ari L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Atwi', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bailey', 'firstname': 'Craig D C', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'McCloskey', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, Center of Dementia Research, Orangeburg, NY, 10962, USA.\nDepartment of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.\nDepartment of Physiology and Neuroscience, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.\nDepartment of Psychology, College of Staten Island, City University of New York, New York, 10314, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Scharfman', 'firstname': 'Helen E', 'initials': 'HE', 'affiliation': 'Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, Center of Dementia Research, Orangeburg, NY, 10962, USA.\nDepartment of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.\nDepartment of Physiology and Neuroscience, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'MacLusky', 'firstname': 'Neil J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada. nmaclusk@uoguelph.ca.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s00429-016-1237-6,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd14e5e0>,,,,,,

20573910",Testosterone during Puberty Shifts Emotional Control from Pulvinar to Anterior Prefrontal Cortex.,"Increased limbic and striatal activation in adolescence has been attributed to a relative delay in the maturation of prefrontal areas, resulting in the increase of impulsive reward-seeking behaviors that are often observed during puberty. However, it remains unclear whether and how this general developmental pattern applies to the control of social emotional actions, a fundamental adult skill refined during adolescence. This domain of control pertains to decisions involving emotional responses. When faced with a social emotional challenge (e.g., an angry face), we can follow automatic response tendencies and avoid the challenge or exert control over those tendencies by selecting an alternative action. Using an fMRI-adapted social approach-avoidance task, this study identifies how the neural regulation of emotional action control changes as a function of human pubertal development in 14-year-old adolescents (n = 47). Pubertal maturation, indexed by testosterone levels, shifted neural regulation of emotional actions from the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus and the amygdala to the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). Adolescents with more advanced pubertal maturation showed greater aPFC activity when controlling their emotional action tendencies, reproducing the same pattern consistently observed in adults. In contrast, adolescents of the same age, but with less advanced pubertal maturation, showed greater pulvinar and amygdala activity when exerting similarly effective emotional control. These findings qualify how, in the domain of social emotional actions, executive control shifts from subcortical to prefrontal structures during pubertal development. The pulvinar and the amygdala are suggested as the ontogenetic precursors of the mature control system centered on the anterior prefrontal cortex.
Adolescents can show distinct behavioral problems when emotionally aroused. This could be related to later development of frontal regions compared with deeper brain structures. This study found that when the control of emotional actions needs to be exerted, more mature adolescents, similar to adults, recruit the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). Less mature adolescents recruit specific subcortical regions, namely the pulvinar and amygdala. These findings identify the subcortical pulvino-amygdalar pathway as a relevant precursor of a mature aPFC emotional control system, opening the way for a neurobiological understanding of how emotion control-related disorders emerge during puberty.","['adolescence', 'approach-avoidance task', 'fMRI', 'frontal pole', 'hormones', 'thalamus']",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2016-06-10,"[{'lastname': 'Tyborowska', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 HR Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and a.tyborowska@donders.ru.nl.'}, {'lastname': 'Volman', 'firstname': 'Inge', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 HR Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Smeekens', 'firstname': 'Sanny', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 HR Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Toni', 'firstname': 'Ivan', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and.'}, {'lastname': 'Roelofs', 'firstname': 'Karin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 HR Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/366156-09$15.00/0.,"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3874-15.2016

456,27239684,Menstrual Cycle and Hormonal Contraceptive-Dependent Changes in Intrinsic Connectivity of Resting-State Brain Networks Correspond to Behavioral Changes Due to Hormonal Status.,"Menstrual cycle-dependent changes have been reported for a variety of functions, including cognition, attention, emotion, inhibition, and perception. For several of these functions, an effect of hormonal contraceptives has also been discussed. Cognitive, attentional, emotional, inhibitory, and perceptual functions have been linked to distinct intrinsic connectivity networks during the resting state. However, changes in resting-state connectivity across the menstrual cycle phase and due to hormonal contraceptive use have only been investigated in two selected networks and without controlling for the type of hormonal contraceptives. In the present study, we demonstrate menstrual cycle and hormonal contraceptive-dependent changes in several intrinsic connectivity networks, including networks that have been related to emotion processing, olfaction, audition, vision, coordination, and two lateralized frontoparietal networks related to a variety of cognitive functions. These changes parallel behavioral changes in the functions associated with these networks. Changes in connectivity and changes in behavior occur during the same cycle phases. Furthermore, hormonal contraceptive-dependent effects were observed in the same networks and same target sites as menstrual cycle-related changes and were dependent on the androgenicity of the progestin component contained in the hormonal contraceptive.","['cognition', 'hormonal contraceptive use', 'intrinsic connectivity', 'menstrual cycle', 'resting state']",Brain connectivity,2016-05-31,"[{'lastname': 'Pletzer', 'firstname': 'Belinda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': '1 Department of Psychology, University of Salzburg , Salzburg, Austria .\n2 Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg , Salzburg, Austria .'}, {'lastname': 'Crone', 'firstname': 'Julia Sophia', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': '2 Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg , Salzburg, Austria .\n3 Department of Psychology, UCLA , Los Angeles, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Kronbichler', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': '2 Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg , Salzburg, Austria .'}, {'lastname': 'Kerschbaum', 'firstname': 'Hubert', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': '2 Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg , Salzburg, Austria .\n4 Department of Cell Biology, University of Salzburg , Salzburg, Austria .'}]",,,,,10.1089/brain.2015.0407,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd0b6630>,,,,,,

9030643",Anabolic-androgenic steroids decrease dendritic spine density in the nucleus accumbens of male rats.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) modify cognitive processes such as decision making and behavioral flexibility. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these AAS-induced cognitive changes remain poorly understood. The mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system, particularly the nucleus accumbens (Acb), is important for reward, motivated behavior, and higher cognitive processes such as decision making. Therefore, AAS-induced plasticity in the DA system is a potential structural substrate for the observed cognitive alterations. High doses of testosterone (the most commonly-used AAS) increase dendritic spine density in limbic regions including the amygdala and hippocampus. However, effects on Acb are unknown. This was the focus of the present study. Adolescent male Long-Evans rats were treated chronically for 8weeks with high-dose testosterone (7.5mg/kg in water with 13% cyclodextrin) or vehicle sc. Brains were stained by Golgi-Cox to analyze neuronal morphology in medium spiny neurons of the shell region of Acb (AcbSh). Eightweeks of testosterone treatment significantly decreased spine density in AcbSh compared to brains of vehicle-treated rats (F1,14=5.455, p<0.05). Testosterone did not significantly affect total spine number, dendritic length, or arborization measured by Sholl analysis. These results show that AAS alter neuronal morphology in AcbSh by decreasing spine density throughout the dendritic tree, and provides a potential mechanism for AAS to modify cognition and decision-making behavior.","['anabolic agents', 'dendritic spine density', 'medium spiny neurons', 'nucleus accumbens', 'testosterone']",Neuroscience,2016-05-31,"[{'lastname': 'Wallin-Miller', 'firstname': 'Kathryn', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.

458,27236486,Single dose testosterone administration reduces loss chasing in healthy females.,"Testosterone has been linked to modulation of impulsivity and risky choice, potentially mediated by changes in reward or punishment sensitivity. This study investigated the effect of testosterone on risk-taking and the adjustment of risk-taking on trials following a gain or a loss. Loss chasing is operationalized herein as the propensity to recover losses by increasing risky choice. Healthy female participants (n=26) received a single-dose of 0.5mg sublingual testosterone in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. At 240min post-administration, participants performed a gambling task with a high and a low risk option. In the placebo condition, participants were more likely to choose the high risk option following losses compared to wins. This effect was abolished on the testosterone session. Ignoring prior outcomes, no overall changes in risk-taking were observed. Our data indicate that testosterone affects human decision-making via diminishing sensitivity to punishment.","['Gambling', 'Punishment sensitivity', 'Risk taking', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-05-30,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Brain Function and Psychological Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Center for Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Department of Psychology, Peking University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Jinting', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Brain Function and Psychological Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Center for Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Department of Psychology, Peking University, Beijing, China; China Center for Special Economic Zone Research, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qu', 'firstname': 'Lujing', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Center for Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Department of Psychology, Peking University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Eisenegger', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychopharmacology and Biopsychology Unit, Department of Basic Psychological Research and Research Methods, Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Clark', 'firstname': 'Luke', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Gambling Research at UBC, Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Xiaolin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Center for Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Department of Psychology, Peking University, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Behavior and Mental Health, Peking University, Beijing, China; IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Peking University, Beijing, China.

459,27235739,"The impact of biological sex and sex hormones on cognition in a rat model of early, pre-motor Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is well known for motor deficits such as bradykinesia. However, patients often experience additional deficits in working memory, behavioral selection, decision-making and other executive functions. Like other features of PD, the incidence and severity of these cognitive symptoms differ in males and females. However, preclinical models have not been used to systematically investigate the roles that sex or sex hormones may play in these complex signs. To address this, we used a Barnes maze spatial memory paradigm to compare the effects of a bilateral nigrostriatal dopamine lesion model of early PD on cognitive behaviors in adult male and female rats and in adult male rats that were gonadectomized or gonadectomized and supplemented with testosterone or estradiol. We found that dopamine lesions produced deficits in working memory and other executive operations, albeit only in male rats where circulating androgen levels were physiological. In males where androgen levels were depleted, lesions produced no additional Barnes maze deficits and attenuated those previously linked to androgen deprivation. We also found that while most measures of Barnes maze performance were unaffected by dopamine lesions in the females, lesions did induce dramatic shifts from their preferred use of thigmotactic navigation to the use of spatially guided place strategies similar to those normally preferred by males. These and other sex- and sex hormone-specific differences in the effects of nigrostriatal dopamine lesions on executive function highlight the potential of gonadal steroids as protective and/or therapeutic for the cognitive symptoms of PD. However, their complexity also indicates the need for a more thorough understanding of androgen and estrogen effects in guiding the development of hormone therapies that might effectively address these non-motor signs.","['6-OHDA', 'Barnes maze', 'androgen', 'estrogen', 'executive function', 'working memory']",Neuroscience,2016-05-29,"[{'lastname': 'Betancourt', 'firstname': 'Erika', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5230, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wachtel', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5230, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Michaelos', 'firstname': 'Michalis', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5230, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Haggerty', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5230, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Conforti', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Northport High School, 154 Laurel Hill Road, Northport, NY 11768, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kritzer', 'firstname': 'Mary F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5230, United States.

21775213",No increased risk of dementia in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a 5-year follow-up study.,"Prior studies suggested that the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with prostate cancer (PC) might cause the impairment of cognitive function which is one of the common symptoms of dementia; however, the association between ADT and cognitive impairment still remains controversial. This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the relationship between ADT and subsequent risk of dementia using a population-based dataset. Data for this study were taken from the Taiwan (China)Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. We included 755 PC patients who received ADT in the study cohort and 559 PC patients who did not receive ADT in the comparison cohort. Each patient was individually tracked for a 5-year period to define those who subsequently received a diagnosis of dementia. Results show that the incidence rates of dementia per 100 person-years were 2.35 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.82-2.98) and 1.85 (95% CI: 1.35-2.48) for PC patients who received ADT and those who did not receive ADT, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for dementia for PC patients who received ADT was 1.21 (95% CI: 0.82-1.78, P = 0.333) compared to those who did not receive ADT.

462,27199064,Statin-Associated Side Effects.,"Hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins are well tolerated, but associated with various statin-associated symptoms (SAS), including statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), diabetes mellitus (DM), and central nervous system complaints. These are ""statin-associated symptoms"" because they are rare in clinical trials, making their causative relationship to statins unclear. SAS are, nevertheless, important because they prompt dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving mediations. SAMS is the most frequent SAS, and mild myalgia may affect 5% to 10% of statin users. Clinically important muscle symptoms, including rhabdomyolysis and statin-induced necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SINAM), are rare. Antibodies against HMG-CoA reductase apparently provoke SINAM. Good evidence links statins to DM, but evidence linking statins to other SAS is largely anecdotal. Management of SAS requires making the possible diagnosis, altering or discontinuing the statin treatment, and using alternative lipid-lowering therapy.","['interstitial lung disease', 'myopathy', 'rhabdomyolysis', 'skeletal muscle']",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2016-05-21,"[{'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'Paul D', 'initials': 'PD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut.

463,27156843,The neurobiology and addiction potential of anabolic androgenic steroids and the effects of growth hormone.,"Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are substances that mimic the hormone testosterone, and primarily act via the androgen receptor. In addition to their physiological effect on muscle tissue and growth, research from the last decade has shown that AAS have a pronounced impact on the central nervous system. A large number of studies have demonstrated that AAS affect the mesolimbic reward system in the brain. However, whether the direct effects of AAS on endorphins, dopamine, serotonin and GABA etc. and on the corresponding and related systems lead to dependence needs to be further elucidated. According to recent studies, the prevalence of AAS dependence among AAS users has been estimated to be approximately 30%, and polysubstance use, of both pharmaceutical drugs and narcotics, within this group is common. The present review primarily discusses AAS in the context of addiction and dependence, and further addresses the issue of using multiple substances, i.e. stimulants and opiates in combination with AAS. In addition, aspects of the treatment of AAS dependence, the connection between AAS abuse and cognition, and AAS-induced neurotoxicity are presented. Currently, performance enhancing drugs are frequently used in combination with AAS. Therefore, a large section on growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor is also included.","['Addiction', 'Anabolic androgenic steroids', 'Brain', 'Drug dependence', 'Growth hormone']",Brain research bulletin,2016-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Grönbladh', 'firstname': 'Alfhild', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The Beijer Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Division of Biological Research on Drug Dependence, BMC, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Nylander', 'firstname': 'Erik', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'The Beijer Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Division of Biological Research on Drug Dependence, BMC, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Hallberg', 'firstname': 'Mathias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'The Beijer Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Division of Biological Research on Drug Dependence, BMC, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

25246593",Sexual selection on male vocal fundamental frequency in humans and other anthropoids.,"In many primates, including humans, the vocalizations of males and females differ dramatically, with male vocalizations and vocal anatomy often seeming to exaggerate apparent body size. These traits may be favoured by sexual selection because low-frequency male vocalizations intimidate rivals and/or attract females, but this hypothesis has not been systematically tested across primates, nor is it clear why competitors and potential mates should attend to vocalization frequencies. Here we show across anthropoids that sexual dimorphism in fundamental frequency (F0) increased during evolutionary transitions towards polygyny, and decreased during transitions towards monogamy. Surprisingly, humans exhibit greater F0 sexual dimorphism than any other ape. We also show that low-F0 vocalizations predict perceptions of men's dominance and attractiveness, and predict hormone profiles (low cortisol and high testosterone) related to immune function. These results suggest that low male F0 signals condition to competitors and mates, and evolved in male anthropoids in response to the intensity of mating competition.","['anthropoid primates', 'attractiveness', 'dominance', 'mating system', 'sexual selection', 'vocal fundamental frequency']",Proceedings.

465,27102919,Testosterone metabolism: a possible biological underpinning of non-verbal IQ in intellectually gifted girls.,"The extraordinary giftedness is apparently a unique manifestation of a mutual interconnection between genes and environment. One of the possible etiological factors of intellectual giftedness is testosterone which is believed to affect the brain organization and function. The aim of our study was to analyze associations between 2D:4D digit ratio (a proxy of prenatal testosterone) and/or salivary testosterone levels with non-verbal IQ in intellectually gifted girls. Fifty-one girls with an age range of 10 to18 years and IQ scores higher than 130 were tested. Saliva samples were collected to obtain levels of salivary testosterone. 2D:4D digit ratio was measured on both hands as an indicator of prenatal testosterone. IQ parameters were assessed employing standardized set of tests. The CAG repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene was analyzed to assess the sensitivity of androgen receptor. Testing of between-subjects effects proved significant interactions between right and left 2D:4D ratio, genetic variability in androgen receptor, and also salivary testosterone level with non-verbal IQ in gifted girls. Our results point out that the variability in parameters of androgenicity contributes to the variability of nonverbal IQ in gifted girls.

23233141",Depressive Mood and Testosterone Related to Declarative Verbal Memory Decline in Middle-Aged Caregivers of Children with Eating Disorders.,"Caring for children diagnosed with a chronic psychological disorder such as an eating disorder (ED) can be used as a model of chronic stress. This kind of stress has been reported to have deleterious effects on caregivers' cognition, particularly in verbal declarative memory of women caregivers. Moreover, high depressive mood and variations in testosterone (T) levels moderate this cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to characterize whether caregivers of individuals with EDs (n = 27) show declarative memory impairments compared to non-caregivers caregivers (n = 27), using for this purpose a standardized memory test (Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test). Its purpose was also to examine the role of depressive mood and T in memory decline. Results showed that ED caregivers presented high depressive mood, which was associated to worse verbal memory performance, especially in the case of women. In addition, all caregivers showed high T levels. Nonetheless, only in the case of women caregivers did T show a curvilinear relationship with verbal memory performance, meaning that the increases of T were associated to the improvement in verbal memory performance, but only up to a certain point, as after such point T continued to increase and memory performance decreased. Thus, chronic stress due to caregiving was associated to disturbances in mood and T levels, which in turn was associated to verbal memory decline. These findings should be taken into account in the implementation of intervention programs for helping ED caregivers cope with caregiving situations and to prevent the risk of a pronounced verbal memory decline.","['caregivers', 'declarative memory', 'depressive mood', 'eating disorders', 'testosterone']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2016-04-14,"[{'lastname': 'Romero-Martínez', 'firstname': 'Ángel', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, Avenida Blasco Ibañez, 2146010 Valencia, Spain.

467,26999078,Physiological and Cognitive Responses to an Antarctic Expedition: A Case Report.,"To assess changes in body composition and monitor cognitive function, subjective well-being, and physiological stress, as measured by salivary hormones and markers of mucosal immunity, during an Antarctic expedition.
A 36-y-old man (188.2 cm height, 94.5 kg body mass) took part in a world-record attempt. A total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and measurement of 8 skinfolds and 5 girths were performed before and after the expedition. In addition, daily subjective data were recorded (sleep quality, total hours of sleep, energy levels, perceived exertion, mood, muscle soreness, and muscle/joint pain) along with distance covered and hours of physical activity per day. As a measure of cognitive function, the athlete completed a computerized battery of tasks (Axon Sports Cognitive Priming Application) every third morning. Saliva samples were collected before, during, and after the expedition to determine salivary cortisol (sCort), testosterone (sT), alpha amylase (sAA), and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA).
The athlete lost 5.3 kg body mass and sum of 8 skinfolds decreased from 73 mm to 59 mm from preexpedition to postexpedition. Psychomotor speed declined over the course of the expedition. sT increased and sCort decreased throughout, and sAA and sIgA peaked toward the end of the expedition.
This case study provides novel data about the physiological and cognitive impact of an Antarctic expedition. The findings may inform strategies for future expeditions, allowing individuals undertaking expeditions of this nature to better prepare for success.","['Antarctica', 'body composition', 'cognitive function', 'salivary hormones']",International journal of sports physiology and performance,2016-03-22,"[{'lastname': 'Anton-Solanas', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': ""O'Neill"", 'firstname': 'Barry V', 'initials': 'BV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morris', 'firstname': 'Tessa E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dunbar', 'firstname': 'Joe', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"The athlete lost 5.3 kg body mass and sum of 8 skinfolds decreased from 73 mm to 59 mm from preexpedition to postexpedition.

15488409",Testosterone reduces functional connectivity during the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' Test.,"Women on average outperform men in cognitive-empathic abilities, such as the capacity to infer motives from the bodily cues of others, which is vital for effective social interaction. The steroid hormone testosterone is thought to play a role in this sexual dimorphism. Strikingly, a previous study shows that a single administration of testosterone in women impairs performance on the 'Reading the Mind in Eyes' Test (RMET), a task in which emotions have to be inferred from the eye-region of a face. This effect was mediated by the 2D:4D ratio, the ratio between the length of the index and ring finger, a proxy for fetal testosterone. Research in typical individuals, in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC), and in individuals with brain lesions has established that performance on the RMET depends on the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that a single administration of testosterone in 16 young women significantly altered connectivity of the left IFG with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) during RMET performance, independent of 2D:4D ratio. This IFG-ACC-SMA network underlies the integration and selection of sensory information, and for action preparation during cognitive empathic behavior. Our findings thus reveal a neural mechanism by which testosterone can impair emotion-recognition ability, and may link to the symptomatology of ASC, in which the same neural network is implicated.","['Autism spectrum conditions', 'Functional MRI', 'Hormones', 'Mindreading', 'Social behavior']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-03-21,"[{'lastname': 'Bos', 'firstname': 'Peter A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Psychology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.

Here, we review the role of sex hormones in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in males and females. The review is framed around the potential functional implications of sex hormone regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with a focus on cognitive function and mood regulation, which may be related to sex differences in incidence and severity of dementia and depression. We present findings from preclinical studies of endogenous fluctuations in sex hormones relating to reproductive function and ageing, and from studies of exogenous hormone manipulations. In addition, we discuss the modulating roles of sex, age, and reproductive history on the relationship between sex hormones and neurogenesis. Because sex hormones have diverse targets in the central nervous system, we overview potential mechanisms through which sex hormones may influence hippocampal neurogenesis. Lastly, we advocate for a more systematic consideration of sex and sex hormones in studying the functional implications of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.","['Androgens', 'Dementia', 'Depression', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Estrone', 'Hippocampus', 'Learning and memory', 'Neurogenesis', 'Parity', 'Progesterone', 'Sex differences', 'Stress', 'Testosterone']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2016-03-19,"[{'lastname': 'Mahmoud', 'firstname': 'Rand', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Wainwright', 'firstname': 'Steven R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Galea', 'firstname': 'Liisa A M', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.

470,26920638,Reference values for salivary testosterone in adolescent boys and girls determined using Isotope-Dilution Liquid-Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS).,The measurement of testosterone in saliva is an attractive alternative to serum analysis due to the simple and non-invasive sample collection. In children and adolescents salivary testosterone is mainly measured to investigate whether puberty has started or not. This study aimed to establish reference values for salivary testosterone during puberty in boys and girls. We measured salivary testosterone using ID-LC-MS/MS in a cohort of 131 girls and 123 boys of whom each had salivary testosterone measured at two time points during puberty. Salivary testosterone concentrations start to increase with the start of puberty around eight years and continuously increase up to adult concentrations in the following ten years. Reference values were calculated using the Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS)-curve fitting method and provided per year from 8 to 26 years of age in boys and girls. These reference ranges may help clinicians and researchers to interpret salivary testosterone results in both individual patients and study subjects.,"['Adolescents', 'Reference values', 'Salivary testosterone']",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2016-02-28,"[{'lastname': 'Büttler', 'firstname': 'Rahel M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Peper', 'firstname': 'Jiska S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands; Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Crone', 'firstname': 'Eveline A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands; Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Lentjes', 'firstname': 'Eef G W', 'initials': 'EGW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Chemistry & Haematology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Blankenstein', 'firstname': 'Marinus A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Heijboer', 'firstname': 'Annemieke C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

15221663",Reversal learning in gonadectomized marmosets with and without hormone replacement: are males more sensitive to punishment?,"This study examined sex differences in executive function in middle-aged gonadectomized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with or without hormonal replacement. We tested ten castrated male (mean age 5.5 years) marmosets treated with testosterone cypionate (T, n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5) on Reversal Learning, which contributes to cognitive flexibility, and the Delayed Response task, measuring working memory. Their performance was compared to that of 11 ovariectomized females (mean age = 3.7 years) treated with Silastic capsules filled with 17-β estradiol (E2, n = 6) or empty capsules (n = 5), previously tested on the same tasks (Lacreuse et al. in J Neuroendocrinol 26:296-309, 2014. doi: 10.1111/jne.12147). Behavioral observations were conducted daily. Females exhibited more locomotor behaviors than males. Males and females did not differ in the number of trials taken to reach criterion on the reversals, but males had significantly longer response latencies, regardless of hormone replacement. They also had a greater number of refusals than females. Additionally, both control and T-treated males, but not females, had slower responses on incorrect trials, suggesting that males were making errors due to distraction, lack of motivation or uncertainty. Furthermore, although both males and females had slower responding following an incorrect compared to a correct trial, the sex difference in response latencies was disproportionally large following an incorrect trial. No sex difference was found in the Delayed Response task. Overall, slower response latencies in males than females during Reversal Learning, especially during and following an incorrect trial, may reflect greater sensitivity to punishment (omission of reward) and greater performance monitoring in males, compared to females. Because these differences occurred in gonadectomized animals and regardless of hormone replacement, they may be organized early in life.","['Cognitive flexibility', 'Estrogen', 'Executive function', 'Response inhibition', 'Testosterone', 'Working memory']",Animal cognition,2016-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'LaClair', 'firstname': 'Matthew', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience and Behavior Program, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, 01003, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lacreuse', 'firstname': 'Agnès', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Tobin Hall, 135 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA, 01003, USA. alacreuse@psych.umass.edu.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s10071-016-0966-5,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcfc17c0>,,,,,,

Women with pelvic pain and laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis were treated with a six-month course of daily intranasal D with concurrent administration of either transdermal E2, intranasal E2, or intranasal E2  + T. Efficacy data included evaluation of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, tenderness, and induration. Cognition and quality of life were also assessed. Safety parameters included assessment of endometrial hyperplasia, bone mineral density (BMD), and hot flashes.
Endometriosis symptoms and signs scores decreased in all treatment arms from a baseline average of 7.4 to 2.5 after 3 months of treatment and 3.4 after 6 months. BMD changes and incidence of hot flashes were minimal, and no endometrial hyperplasia was observed. Patient-reported outcomes showed significant improvement across multiple domains.

In this cross-sectional observational study, 53 nondiabetic men with abdominal obesity (mean body mass index, 37.3 kg/m(2) ; age, 22-45 years) and normal intelligence underwent detailed measures of body composition, hormonal profiles, and cognition. Age- and education-adjusted performance in five cognitive domains was examined.
Total fat percentage was negatively associated with visuospatial skills (P = 0.002) and visual memory (P = 0.012). Insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) was also negatively associated with these domains (P = 0.05 and trend, P = 0.06, respectively). Total testosterone levels were negatively associated with executive function and verbal learning and memory (P = 0.04 for each), but free testosterone was not. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was also inversely associated with performance in these domains (P = 0.015 and trend, P = 0.09, respectively). In a stepwise regression model including percentage fat, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, SHBG, and free testosterone, SHBG was the only variable selected for executive function (P = 0.05) and showed a trend for verbal learning and memory (P = 0.09).

474,26878092,Does polycystic ovary syndrome affect cognition? A functional magnetic resonance imaging study exploring working memory.,"To study effects of overexposure to androgens and subsequent antiandrogenic treatment on brain activity during working memory processes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
In this longitudinal study, working memory function was evaluated with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women with PCOS before and after antiandrogenic treatment.
Department of reproductive medicine, university medical center.
Fourteen women with PCOS and with hyperandrogenism and 20 healthy control women without any features of PCOS or other hormonal disorders.
Antiandrogenic hormone treatment.
Functional MRI response during a working memory task.
At baseline women with PCOS showed more activation than the control group within the right superior parietal lobe and the inferior parietal lobe during task (all memory conditions). Task performance (speed and accuracy) did not differ between the groups. After antiandrogenic treatment the difference in overall brain activity between the groups disappeared and accuracy in the high memory load condition of the working memory task increased in women with PCOS.
Women with PCOS may need additional neural resources during a working memory task compared with women without PCOS, suggesting less efficient executive functioning. This inefficiency may have effects on daily life functioning of women with PCOS. Antiandrogenic treatment appears to have a beneficial effect on this area of cognitive functioning.

20408186","Testosterone Modulates Altered Prefrontal Control of Emotional Actions in Psychopathic Offenders(1,2,3).","Psychopathic individuals are notorious for their controlled goal-directed aggressive behavior. Yet, during social challenges, they often show uncontrolled emotional behavior. Healthy individuals can control their social emotional behavior through anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) downregulation of neural activity in the amygdala, with testosterone modulating aPFC-amygdala coupling. This study tests whether individual differences in this neuroendocrine system relate to the paradoxical lack of emotional control observed in human psychopathic offenders. Emotional control was operationalized with an fMRI-adapted approach-avoidance task requiring rule-driven control over rapid emotional responses. Fifteen psychopathic offenders and 19 matched healthy control subjects made approaching and avoiding movements in response to emotional faces. Control of social emotional behavior was required during affect-incongruent trials, when participants had to override affect-congruent, automatic action tendencies and select the opposite response. Psychopathic offenders showed less control-related aPFC activity and aPFC-amygdala coupling during trials requiring control of emotional actions, when compared with healthy control subjects. This pattern was particularly pronounced in psychopathic individuals with high endogenous testosterone levels. These findings suggest that reduced prefrontal coordination underlies reduced behavioral control in psychopathic offenders during emotionally provoking situations. Even though the modest sample size warrants replication, the modulatory role of endogenous testosterone on the aPFC-amygdala circuit suggests a neurobiological substrate of individual differences that is relevant for the advancement of treatment and the reduction of recidivism.","['amygdala', 'connectivity', 'emotion', 'fMRI', 'prefrontal', 'psychopathy']",eNeuro,2016-02-16,"[{'lastname': 'Volman', 'firstname': 'Inge', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, London WC1N 3BG, United Kingdom; Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 HR, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'von Borries', 'firstname': 'Anna Katinka Louise', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 HR, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, UMC Sint Radboud, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Pompestichting, 6532 CN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bulten', 'firstname': 'Berend Hendrik', 'initials': 'BH', 'affiliation': 'Pompestichting , 6532 CN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Verkes', 'firstname': 'Robbert Jan', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, UMC Sint Radboud, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Pompestichting, 6532 CN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Toni', 'firstname': 'Ivan', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Nijmegen , 6525 EN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Roelofs', 'firstname': 'Karin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 HR, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525 EN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,,"10.1523/ENEURO.0107-15.2016

19744108",A Mendelian randomization study of testosterone and cognition in men.,"Testosterone replacement for older men is increasingly common, with some observations suggesting a protective effect on cognitive function. We examined the association of endogenous testosterone with cognitive function among older men in a Mendelian randomization study using a separate-sample instrumental variable (SSIV) analysis estimator to minimize confounding and reverse causality. A genetic score predicting testosterone was developed in 289 young Chinese men from Hong Kong, based on selected testosterone-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10046, rs1008805 and rs1256031). The association of genetically predicted testosterone with delayed 10-word recall score and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was assessed at baseline and follow-up using generalized estimating equation among 4,212 older Chinese men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Predicted testosterone was not associated with delayed 10-word recall score (-0.02 per nmol/L testosterone, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.06-0.02) or MMSE score (0.06, 95% CI -0.002-0.12). These estimates were similar after additional adjustment for age, education, smoking, use of alcohol, body mass index and the Framingham score.

15929888",Gonadal Hormones Rapidly Enhance Spatial Memory and Increase Hippocampal Spine Density in Male Rats.,"17β-estradiol (E2) rapidly, within minutes, activates behaviors and cognition by binding to membrane estrogen receptors, activating cell signaling cascades and increasing dendritic spines. In female rodents, E2 enhances spatial memory within 2-4 hours, and spine density is increased in the CA1 area of the hippocampus within 30-60 minutes. Although chronic gonadal hormone treatments in male rats alter cognition and spines/spine synapses and acute hormone effects occur in hippocampal slices, effects of acute, in vivo hormone administration in males are unknown. Therefore, we assessed rapid effects of E2 (20 μg/kg) and testosterone (T) (750 μg/kg) on spatial memory using the object placement task and on hippocampal spine density using Golgi impregnation. Orchidectomized rats received hormones immediately after the training trial and were tested for retention 2 hours later. Vehicle-injected orchidectomized males spent equal time exploring objects in the old and new locations, but E2- or T-treated subjects spent more time exploring objects at the new location, suggesting enhanced memory. Both hormones also increased spine density in CA1, but not the dentate gyrus, by 20%-40% at 30 minutes and 2 hours after injections. This report is the first, to our knowledge, to show E2 and T enhancements of memory and spine density within such a short time frame in male rats.",[],Endocrinology,2016-02-05,"[{'lastname': 'Jacome', 'firstname': 'Luis F', 'initials': 'LF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology (L.F.J., K.B., D.B., F.L., V.N.L.), Hunter College of City University of New York, New York, New York 10021; and Department of Science Education (M.F.), Hofstra North Shore Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York 11549.'}, {'lastname': 'Barateli', 'firstname': 'Ketti', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology (L.F.J., K.B., D.B., F.L., V.N.L.), Hunter College of City University of New York, New York, New York 10021; and Department of Science Education (M.F.), Hofstra North Shore Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York 11549.'}, {'lastname': 'Buitrago', 'firstname': 'Dina', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology (L.F.J., K.B., D.B., F.L., V.N.L.), Hunter College of City University of New York, New York, New York 10021; and Department of Science Education (M.F.), Hofstra North Shore Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York 11549.'}, {'lastname': 'Lema', 'firstname': 'Franklin', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology (L.F.J., K.B., D.B., F.L., V.N.L.), Hunter College of City University of New York, New York, New York 10021; and Department of Science Education (M.F.), Hofstra North Shore Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York 11549.'}, {'lastname': 'Frankfurt', 'firstname': 'Maya', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology (L.F.J., K.B., D.B., F.L., V.N.L.), Hunter College of City University of New York, New York, New York 10021; and Department of Science Education (M.F.), Hofstra North Shore Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York 11549.'}, {'lastname': 'Luine', 'firstname': 'Victoria N', 'initials': 'VN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology (L.F.J., K.B., D.B., F.L., V.N.L.), Hunter College of City University of New York, New York, New York 10021; and Department of Science Education (M.F.), Hofstra North Shore Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York 11549.'}]",,,,,"10.1210/en.2015-1959

The experimental model was created by intracerebroventricular injection of β-amyloid (25-35) into gonadectomized (GDX) rats and GDX rats with testosterone propionate (TP, 0.5mg/kg, subcutaneous, once daily, 28 days) supplementation. Ropren® was administered to the GDX rats and GDX rats treated with TP. Memory performance was assessed using the passive avoidance and the Morris water maze tests and the spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed using the open field test. Treatment with Ropren® significantly improved and restored the cognitive ability of GDX rats with β-amyloid (25-35)-induced amnesia in the passive avoidance test and Morris water maze. Co-administration of Ropren® with TP exerted a markedly synergistic memory-enhancing effect in the GDX rats with β-amyloid (25-35)-induced amnesia on the same models of memory testing. Ropren® administered alone or together with TP significantly enhanced crossing, frequency of rearing and grooming of the GDX rats with β-amyloid (25-35)-induced amnesia in the open field test. These results indicate that Ropren® has a marked memory-enhancing action in the experimental model of Alzheimer's disease in male rats with altered levels of androgens.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Gonadectomy', 'Memory', 'Ropren®', 'Testosterone', 'β-Amyloid (25–35)']",Physiology & behavior,2016-01-29,"[{'lastname': 'Fedotova', 'firstname': 'Julia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, I.P.

26192410",Can women detect cues to ovulation in other women's faces?,"Recent research suggests that men find portraits of ovulatory women more attractive than photographs of the same women taken during the luteal phase. Only few studies have investigated whether the same is true for women. The ovulatory phase matters to men because women around ovulation are most likely to conceive, and might matter to women because fertile women might pose a reproductive threat. In an online study 160 women were shown face pairs, one of which was assimilated to the shape of a late follicular prototype and the other to a luteal prototype, and were asked to indicate which face they found more attractive. A further 60 women were tested in the laboratory using a similar procedure. In addition to choosing the more attractive face, these participants were asked which woman would be more likely to steal their own date. Because gonadal hormones influence competitive behaviour, we also examined whether oestradiol, testosterone and progesterone levels predict women's choices. The women found neither the late follicular nor the luteal version more attractive. However, naturally cycling women with higher oestradiol levels were more likely to choose the ovulatory woman as the one who would entice their date than women with lower oestradiol levels.

480,26773929,Testosterone deprivation has neither additive nor synergistic effects with obesity on the cognitive impairment in orchiectomized and/or obese male rats.,"Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between cognitive decline and either testosterone deprivation or obesity. However, the effect of obesity combined with testosterone deprivation on cognitive function has not been investigated. This study investigated the effects of obesity on brain insulin sensitivity, brain mitochondrial function, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in testosterone-deprived male rats.
Male Wistar rats were divided into sham-operated (control) and bilateral orchiectomized (ORX) groups. Rats in each group were further divided into two subgroups to receive either a normal diet (ND) or a high fat diet (HFD) for 4, 8 or 12weeks. Blood samples were collected to determine metabolic parameters. Cognitive function was tested using the Morris Water Maze Test. At the end of the study, brains were removed to investigate brain insulin sensitivity, brain mitochondrial function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
Both control-obese and ORX-obese rats developed peripheral insulin resistance at week eight, and brain insulin resistance as well as brain mitochondrial dysfunction at week 12. However, the ORX-obese rats developed cognitive impairment and decreased hippocampal synaptic plasticity beginning at week eight, whereas the control-obese rats developed these impairments later at week 12. Although both peripheral and brain insulin resistance were not observed in both the control-lean and ORX-lean rats, impaired cognition and decreased hippocampal synaptic plasticity were found in the ORX-lean rats beginning at week eight.
These findings suggest that testosterone deprivation has neither additive nor synergistic effects over obesity in the development of cognitive dysfunction in orchiectomized-obese male rats.","['Brain insulin sensitivity', 'Brain mitochondrial function', 'Hippocampal synaptic function', 'Obese-insulin resistance', 'Testosterone deprivation']",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2016-01-17,"[{'lastname': 'Pintana', 'firstname': 'Hiranya', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Pratchayasakul', 'firstname': 'Wasana', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Sa-nguanmoo', 'firstname': 'Piangkwan', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Pongkan', 'firstname': 'Wanpitak', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Tawinvisan', 'firstname': 'Rungroj', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Nipon', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chattipakorn', 'firstname': 'Siriporn C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Neurophysiology Unit, Cardiac Electrophysiology Research and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Oral Biology and Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.

19406906",Nucleus accumbens response to rewards and testosterone levels are related to alcohol use in adolescents and young adults.,"During adolescence there is a normative increase in risk-taking behavior, which is reflected in, for example, increases in alcohol consumption. Prior research has demonstrated a link between testosterone and alcohol consumption, and between testosterone and neural responses to rewards. Yet, no study to date tested how testosterone levels and neural responses to rewards relate to and predict individual differences in alcohol use. The current study aimed to investigate this by assessing alcohol use, testosterone levels and neural responses to rewards in adolescents (12-17 years old) and young adults (18-26 years old). Participants were measured twice with a two-year interval between testing sessions. Cross-sectional analysis showed that at the second time point higher neural activity to rewards, but not testosterone levels, explained significant variance above age in reported alcohol use. Predictive analyses showed that, higher testosterone level at the first time point, but not neural activity to rewards at the first time point, was predictive of more alcohol use at the second time point. These results suggest that neural responses to rewards are correlated with current alcohol consumption, and that testosterone level is predictive of future alcohol consumption. These results are interpreted in the context of trajectory models of adolescent development.","['Adolescence', 'Alcohol', 'Nucleus accumbens', 'Risk-taking', 'fMRI']",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2016-01-16,"[{'lastname': 'Braams', 'firstname': 'Barbara R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Leiden University, The Netherlands; Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition (LIBC), The Netherlands.

482,26751627,Testosterone and estrogen impact social evaluations and vicarious emotions: A double-blind placebo-controlled study.,"The abilities to ""read"" other peoples' intentions and emotions, and to learn from their experiences, are critical to survival. Previous studies have highlighted the role of sex hormones, notably testosterone and estrogen, in these processes. Yet it is unclear how these hormones affect social cognition and emotion using acute hormonal administration. In the present double-blind placebo-controlled study, we administered an acute exogenous dose of testosterone or estrogen to healthy female and male volunteers, respectively, with the aim of investigating the effects of these steroids on social-cognitive and emotional processes. Following hormonal and placebo treatment, participants made (a) facial dominance judgments, (b) mental state inferences (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test), and (c) learned aversive associations through watching others' emotional responses (observational fear learning [OFL]). Our results showed that testosterone administration to females enhanced ratings of facial dominance but diminished their accuracy in inferring mental states. In men, estrogen administration resulted in an increase in emotional (vicarious) reactivity when watching a distressed other during the OFL task. Taken together, these results suggest that sex hormones affect social-cognitive and emotional functions at several levels, linking our results to neuropsychiatric disorders in which these functions are impaired.

17942736",Sex differences in visuospatial abilities persist during induced hypogonadism.,"Despite well-established sex differences in the performance on tests of several cognitive domains (e.g., visuospatial ability), few studies in humans have evaluated if these sex differences are evident both in the presence of circulating sex hormones and during sex steroid hormonal suppression. Sex differences identified in the relative absence of circulating levels of estradiol and testosterone suggest that differences in brain structure or function exist independent of current hormonal environment and are more likely a reflection of differing developmental exposures and/or genetic substrates.
To evaluate cognitive performance in healthy eugonadal men and women before and again during GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism.
Men (n=16) and women (n=15) without medical or psychiatric illness were matched for IQ. Cognitive tests were performed at baseline (when eugonadal) and after 6-8 weeks of GnRH agonist-induced gonadal suppression. The test batteries included measures of verbal and spatial memory, spatial ability, verbal fluency, motor speed/dexterity, and attention/concentration. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures models.
During both eugonadism and hypogonadism, men performed significantly better than women on several measures of visuospatial performance including mental rotation, line orientation, Money Road Map, Porteus maze, and complex figure drawing. Although some test performances showed an effect of hormone treatment, the majority of these differences reflected an improved performance during hypogonadism compared with baseline (and probably reflected practice effects).
The well-documented male advantage in visuospatial performance, which we observed during eugonadal conditions, was maintained in the context of short-term suppression of gonadal function in both men and women. These findings suggest that, in humans, sex differences in visuospatial performance are not merely dependent on differences in the current circulating sex steroid environment. Thus sex differences in visuospatial performance in adulthood could reflect early developmental effects of sex steroid exposure or other environmental exposures differing across the sexes as our data confirm that these differences are independent of circulating estradiol or testosterone levels in men and women.","['Hypogonadism', 'Mental rotation', 'Sex differences', 'Sex steroids', 'Visuospatial']",Neuropsychologia,2016-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Guerrieri', 'firstname': 'Gioia M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health & Human Services, Bldg. 10-CRC, Room 25330, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1277, Bethesda, MD 20892-1277, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wakim', 'firstname': 'Paul G', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Biostatistics and Clinical Epidemiology Service, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Keenan', 'firstname': 'P A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Cronos Clinical Consulting (formerly Wayne State University), 22 Tanglewood Drive, Titusville, NJ 08560, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Schenkel', 'firstname': 'Linda A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health & Human Services, Bldg. 10-CRC, Room 25330, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1277, Bethesda, MD 20892-1277, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Berlin', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health & Human Services, Bldg. 10-CRC, Room 25330, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1277, Bethesda, MD 20892-1277, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Gibson', 'firstname': 'Carolyn J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health & Human Services, Bldg. 10-CRC, Room 25330, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1277, Bethesda, MD 20892-1277, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Rubinow', 'firstname': 'David R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Peter J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health & Human Services, Bldg. 10-CRC, Room 25330, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1277, Bethesda, MD 20892-1277, United States.

21934121",An Autistic Endophenotype and Testosterone Are Involved in an Atypical Decline in Selective Attention and Visuospatial Processing in Middle-Aged Women.,"Mothers of offspring with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could present mild forms of their children's cognitive characteristics, resulting from prenatal brain exposure and sensitivity to testosterone (T). Indeed, their cognition is frequently characterized by hyper-systemizing, outperforming in tests that assess cognitive domains such as selective attention, and fine motor and visuospatial skills. In the general population, all these start to decline around the mid-forties. This study aimed to characterize whether middle-aged women who are biological mothers of individuals with ASD had better performance in the aforementioned cognitive skills than mothers of normative children (in both groups n = 22; mean age = 45), using the standardized Stroop and mirror-drawing tests. We also examined the role of T in their performance in the aforementioned tests. ASD mothers outperformed controls in both tests, giving more correct answers and making fewer mistakes. In addition, they presented higher T levels, which have been associated with better cognitive performance. Cognitive decline in specific skills with aging could be delayed in these middle-aged women, corresponding to a cognitive endophenotype, T playing an important role in this process.","['Autism spectrum disorders', 'caregiver', 'selective attention', 'testosterone', 'women']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2015-12-24,"[{'lastname': 'Ángel', 'firstname': 'Romero-Martínez', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychobiology, University of Valencia, Avenida Blasco Ibañez, 21, 46010 Valencia, Spain.

485,26680580,Sex Steroid Replacement Therapy in Female Hypogonadism from Childhood to Young Adulthood.,"The overall goal of pubertal sex hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in girls is not only about development of secondary sexual characteristics, but also to establish an adult endocrine and metabolic milieu, as well as adult cognitive function. Estradiol (E2) is the first choice for HRT compared to ethinyl estradiol (EE2). E2 is the most potent endogenous estrogen in the circulation, with established levels during spontaneous puberty. Transdermal E2, compared to oral administration, is the first choice to start pubertal HRT. Transdermal application avoids liver exposure to supraphysiologic estrogen concentrations and provides a more physiologic mechanism for hormone delivery. By cutting E2 matrix patches in doses of 0.05-0.07 µg/kg or administrate E2 gel in doses of 0.1 mg/day, serum concentrations of E2 seen in early spontaneous puberty can be obtained. Patches can be removed in the morning and thereby mimic the normal circadian rhythm. For those clinics with access to sensitive E2 determinations methods (extraction followed by radioimmunoassay or mass spectrometry) monitoring the attained E2 serum levels is recommended in order to optimally mimic the levels seen in early puberty as well as growth velocity, breast and uterus development. Mid- and late pubertal HRT is obtained by increased doses of E2, adding cyclic oral or transdermal progestin, as well as testosterone gel over the pubic area if indicated.",[],Endocrine development,2015-12-19,"[{'lastname': 'Norjavaara', 'firstname': 'Ensio', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ankarberg-Lindgren', 'firstname': 'Carina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kriström', 'firstname': 'Berit', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"© 2016 S.

10494574",Reduced short term memory in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and its relationship to spatial and quantitative performance.,"Girls and women with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) experience elevated androgens prenatally and show increased male-typical development for certain behaviors. Further, individuals with CAH receive glucocorticoid (GC) treatment postnatally, and this GC treatment could have negative cognitive consequences. We investigated two alternative hypotheses, that: (a) early androgen exposure in females with CAH masculinizes (improves) spatial perception and quantitative abilities at which males typically outperform females, or (b) CAH is associated with performance decrements in these domains, perhaps due to reduced short-term-memory (STM). Adolescent and adult individuals with CAH (40 female and 29 male) were compared with relative controls (29 female and 30 male) on spatial perception and quantitative abilities as well as on Digit Span (DS) to assess STM and on Vocabulary to assess general intelligence. Females with CAH did not perform better (more male-typical) on spatial perception or quantitative abilities than control females, failing to support the hypothesis of cognitive masculinization. Rather, in the sample as a whole individuals with CAH scored lower on spatial perception (p ≤ .009), a quantitative composite (p ≤ .036), and DS (p ≤ .001), despite no differences in general intelligence. Separate analyses of adolescent and adult participants suggested the spatial and quantitative effects might be present only in adult patients with CAH; however, reduced DS performance was found in patients with CAH regardless of age group. Separate regression analyses showed that DS predicted both spatial perception and quantitative performance (both p ≤ .001), when age, sex, and diagnosis status were controlled. Thus, reduced STM in CAH patients versus controls may have more general cognitive consequences, potentially reducing spatial perception and quantitative skills. Although hyponatremia or other aspects of salt-wasting crises or additional hormone abnormalities cannot be ruled out as potential contributors, elevated GCs appear to be the most likely contributor to reductions in STM. Additional efforts to monitor GC administration protocols may help achieve optimal cognitive outcomes. Educational intervention for individuals with CAH might also be useful.","['Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)', 'Digit span', 'Glucocorticoid', 'Quantitative', 'Short term memory', 'Spatial perception']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2015-12-19,"[{'lastname': 'Collaer', 'firstname': 'Marcia L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Middlebury College, Middlebury, VT 05753, USA.

16926258",Increased sexual desire with exogenous testosterone administration in men with obstructive sleep apnea: a randomized placebo-controlled study.,"Testosterone (T) deficiency, sexual dysfunction, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are common and often coexist. T prescriptions have increased worldwide during the last decade, including to those with undiagnosed or untreated OSA. The effect of T administration on sexual function, neurocognitive performance and quality of life in these men is poorly defined. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of T administration on sexual function, quality of life and neurocognitive performance in obese men with OSA. We also secondarily examined whether baseline T might modify the effects of T treatment by dichotomizing on baseline T levels pre-specified at 8, 11 and 13 nmol/L. This was a randomized placebo-controlled study in which 67 obese men with OSA (mean age 49 ± 1.3 years) were randomized to receive intramuscular injections of either 1000 mg T undecanoate or placebo at baseline, week 6 and week 12. All participants were concurrently enrolled in a weight loss program. General and sleep-related quality of life, neurocognitive performance and subjective sexual function were assessed before and 6, 12 and 18 weeks after therapy. T compared to placebo increased sexual desire (p = 0.004) in all men, irrespective of baseline T levels. There were no differences in erectile function, frequency of sexual attempts, orgasmic ability, general or sleep-related quality of life or neurocognitive function (all p = NS). In those with baseline T levels below 8 nmol/L, T increased vitality (p = 0.004), and reduced reports of feeling down (p = 0.002) and nervousness (p = 0.03). Our findings show that 18 weeks of T therapy increased sexual desire in obese men with OSA independently of baseline T levels whereas improvements in quality of life were evident only in those with T levels below 8 nmol/L. These small improvements would need to be balanced against potentially more serious adverse effects of T therapy on breathing.","['neurocognitive function', 'obstructive sleep apnea', 'sexual desire', 'testosterone supplementation']",Andrology,2015-11-28,"[{'lastname': 'Melehan', 'firstname': 'K L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Centre for The Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nSydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nDepartment of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoyos', 'firstname': 'C M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Centre for The Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nSydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Yee', 'firstname': 'B J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Centre for The Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nSydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nDepartment of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'K K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Centre for The Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nSydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nDepartment of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Buchanan', 'firstname': 'P R', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Centre for The Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Grunstein', 'firstname': 'R R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Centre for The Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nSydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nDepartment of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'P Y', 'initials': 'PY', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Centre for The Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nSydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}]",,,,© 2015 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.,10.1111/andr.12132,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcda2ef0>,,,,,,

17346715",White Matter Microstructure and Cognitive Function in Young Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, which leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in later life. Androgens and insulin signaling affect brain function but little is known about brain structure and function in younger adults with PCOS.
To establish whether young women with PCOS display altered white matter microstructure and cognitive function. PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Eighteen individuals with PCOS (age, 31 ± 6 y; body mass index [BMI] 30 ± 6 kg/m(2)) and 18 control subjects (age, 31 ± 7 y; BMI, 29 ± 6 kg/m(2)), matched for age, IQ, and BMI, underwent anthropometric and metabolic evaluation, diffusion tensor MRI, a technique especially sensitive to brain white matter structure, and cognitive assessment. Cognitive scores and white matter diffusion metrics were compared between groups. White matter microstructure was evaluated across the whole white matter skeleton using tract-based spatial statistics. Associations with metabolic indices were also evaluated.
PCOS was associated with a widespread reduction in axial diffusivity (diffusion along the main axis of white matter fibers) and increased tissue volume fraction (the proportion of volume filled by white or grey matter rather than cerebrospinal fluid) in the corpus callosum. Cognitive performance was reduced compared with controls (first principal component, t = 2.9, P = .007), reflecting subtle decrements across a broad range of cognitive tests, despite similar education and premorbid intelligence. In PCOS, there was a reversal of the relationship seen in controls between brain microstructure and both androgens and insulin resistance.
White matter microstructure is altered, and cognitive performance is compromised, in young adults with PCOS. These alterations in brain structure and function are independent of age, education and BMI. If reversible, these changes represent a potential target for treatment.",[],The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2015-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Rees', 'firstname': 'D Aled', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Molecular and Experimental Medicine (D.A.R., M.U.), School of Medicine and Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (M.U., D.K.J., M.J.O.), School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom; Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience (R.B., M.J.O.), Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 9RX, United Kingdom; and Department of Neurology (R.B.), University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Zaloska cesta 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.""}, {'lastname': 'Udiawar', 'firstname': 'Maneesh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Molecular and Experimental Medicine (D.A.R., M.U.), School of Medicine and Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (M.U., D.K.J., M.J.O.), School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom; Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience (R.B., M.J.O.), Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 9RX, United Kingdom; and Department of Neurology (R.B.), University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Zaloska cesta 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.""}, {'lastname': 'Berlot', 'firstname': 'Rok', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Molecular and Experimental Medicine (D.A.R., M.U.), School of Medicine and Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (M.U., D.K.J., M.J.O.), School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom; Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience (R.B., M.J.O.), Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 9RX, United Kingdom; and Department of Neurology (R.B.), University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Zaloska cesta 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.""}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Derek K', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Molecular and Experimental Medicine (D.A.R., M.U.), School of Medicine and Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (M.U., D.K.J., M.J.O.), School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom; Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience (R.B., M.J.O.), Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 9RX, United Kingdom; and Department of Neurology (R.B.), University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Zaloska cesta 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.""}, {'lastname': ""O'Sullivan"", 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Molecular and Experimental Medicine (D.A.R., M.U.), School of Medicine and Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (M.U., D.K.J., M.J.O.), School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom; Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience (R.B., M.J.O.), Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 9RX, United Kingdom; and Department of Neurology (R.B.), University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Zaloska cesta 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.""}]",,,"PCOS was associated with a widespread reduction in axial diffusivity (diffusion along the main axis of white matter fibers) and increased tissue volume fraction (the proportion of volume filled by white or grey matter rather than cerebrospinal fluid) in the corpus callosum.

17467578",The Effects of Testosterone Supplementation on Cognitive Functioning in Older Men.,"Reduction in testosterone levels in men during aging is associated with cognitive decline and risk of dementia. Animal studies have shown benefits for testosterone supplementation in improving cognition and reducing Alzheimer's disease pathology. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of men with subjective memory complaint and low testosterone levels, we investigated whether testosterone treatment significantly improved performance on various measures of cognitive functioning. Forty-four men were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to establish the baseline prior to being randomly divided into two groups. The first group (Group A) received 24 weeks of testosterone treatment (T treatment) followed by 4 weeks washout, and then 24 weeks of placebo (P); the second group (Group B) received the same treatments, in reverse order (Placebo, washout, and then T treatment). In group A (TèP), compared to baseline, there was a modest (1 point) but significant improvement in general cognitive functioning as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) following testosterone treatment. This improvement from baseline was sustained following the washout period and crossover to placebo treatment. Similar Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were observed when comparing testosterone treatment with placebo. In group B (PèT) a significant increase was observed from baseline following testosterone treatment and a trend towards an increase when compared to placebo treatment. Improvements in baseline depression scores (assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale) were observed following testosterone/placebo treatment in both groups, and no difference was observed when comparing testosterone with placebo treatment. Our findings indicate a modest improvement on global cognition with testosterone treatment. Larger clinical trials with a longer follow- up and with the inclusion of blood and brain imaging markers are now needed to conclusively determine the significance of testosterone treatment.",[],CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2015-11-11,"[{'lastname': 'Wahjoepramono', 'firstname': 'Eka J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Asih', 'firstname': 'Prita R', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Aniwiyanti', 'firstname': 'Vilia', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Taddei', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dhaliwal', 'firstname': 'Satvinder S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fuller', 'firstname': 'Stephanie J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Foster', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carruthers', 'firstname': 'Malcolm', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Verdile', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sohrabi', 'firstname': 'Hamid R', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Martins', 'firstname': 'Ralph N', 'initials': 'RN', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Computing, Health, and Science, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA, Australia. r.martins@ecu.edu.au.'}]",,,,,10.2174/1871527315666151110125704,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcddc860>,,,,,,
490,26542812,Changes in spatial cognition and brain activity after a single dose of testosterone in healthy women.,"Studies have consistently shown that males perform better than females on several spatial tasks. Animal and human literature suggests that sex hormones have an important role in both establishing and maintaining this difference. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of exogenous testosterone on spatial cognition and brain activity in healthy women. A cross-sectional, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed in 42 healthy young women who either received one dose of 0.5mg sublingual testosterone or placebo. They then learned a virtual environment and performed navigation tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subsequently, their knowledge of the virtual environment, self-reported navigation strategy, and mental rotation abilities were measured. The testosterone group had improved representations of the directions within the environment and performed significantly better on the mental rotation task compared to the placebo group, but navigation success and navigation strategy were similar in the two groups. Nevertheless, the testosterone group had significantly increased activity within the medial temporal lobe during successful navigation compared to the placebo group, and a positive correlation between testosterone load and medial temporal lobe activity was found. Fetal testosterone levels, measured as second-to-fourth digit length ratio, interacted significantly with parahippocampal activity and tended towards giving higher mental rotation task scores. These results demonstrated that testosterone had a limited effect pertaining specifically to spatial cognition involving 3D-visualization in healthy women, while complex behaviors such as navigation, relying more on learned strategies, were not altered despite increased neuronal activity in relevant brain regions.","['Amygdala', 'Hippocampus', 'Parahippocampal cortex', 'Pharmacological fMRI', 'Sexual dimorphism', 'Wayfinding']",Behavioural brain research,2015-11-07,"[{'lastname': 'Pintzka', 'firstname': 'Carl W S', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neuroscience, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), 7489 Trondheim, Norway; Department of Medical Imaging, St. Olav's Hospital, 7489 Trondheim, Norway.

491,26529502,Effects of Testosterone Treatment on Synaptic Plasticity and Behavior in Senescence Accelerated Mice.,"Learning and memory are known to be influenced by circulating sex steroidal hormones and these behavioral processes are diminished in aging. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the mechanism underlying testosterone-induced effects on cognitive performance in the senescence accelerated mouse P8 (SAMP8) model. Treatment with testosterone (T) as evidenced by the Morris water maze test produced a significantly shorter escape latency and reduced path length to reach the platform compared to the control (C). No significant differences were noted in mean swim speed among all groups. During the probe trials, the T group spent a significantly greater percent of time in the target quadrant and improved the number of platform crossings. Flutamide (F), an antiandrogen, significantly inhibited the effects of T on behavioral and memory performances indicators. Following Nissl staining, the number of intact pyramidal cells was markedly elevated in the treated mice, and this effect was blocked by F. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of NMDAR1, SYN, and p-CREC/CREB protein levels were significantly increased in the T group, while F inhibited the T-mediated effects. Western blot analysis showed that there were no significant differences in the expression levels of SYN, p-CREC/CREB, and NMDAR1 between C, F, and F + T groups. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the mRNA expression levels of NMDAR1 and SYN were significantly increased in T-administered mice, while F inhibited the T-mediated effects. Data suggest that the T-mediated increase in SYN expression levels resulted in improvement in behavioral performances and learning, which may involve stimulation of central nervous system androgen receptors (AR).",[],Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

25544359",Update on primary ovarian insufficiency.,"Despite an incidence of 1% among women under the age of 40, primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is still poorly understood. As the variable cause and presentation of POI complicate its management, a standard regimen for treatment remains to be established. However, emerging research has provided new insight on current mainstays of treatment as well as novel management approaches and therapeutic interventions.
Recent clinical trials in women with POI indicate that the widely used regimen of transdermal estradiol and medroxyprogesterone acetate restores bone mineral density to a level equal to women with normal ovarian function. Further research verifies that compounded bioidentical hormones and androgen supplementation are inadequate in treating POI and lowering risk for long-term sequelae. Additionally, assessing changes in bone turnover markers may be useful for monitoring bone mineral density.

16908801",Testosterone Replacement Therapy and Mortality in Older Men.,"While US testosterone prescriptions have tripled in the last decade with lower trends in Europe, debate continues over the risks, benefits and appropriate use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Several authors blame advertising and the availability of more convenient formulations, whilst others have pointed out that the routine testing of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) (a significant marker of cardiovascular risk) and those with diabetes would inevitably increase the diagnosis of hypogonadism and lead to an increase in totally appropriate prescribing. They commented that this was merely an appropriate correction of previous under-diagnosis and under-treatment in line with evidence based guidelines. It is unlikely that persuasive advertising or convenient formulations could grow a market over such a sustained period if the treatment was not effective. Urologists and primary care physicians are the most frequent initiators of TRT usually for ED. Benefits are clearly established for sexual function, increase in lean muscle mass and strength, mood and cognitive function, with a possible reduction in frailty and osteoporosis. There remains no evidence that TRT is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer or symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, yet the decision to initiate and continue therapy is often decided by urologists. The cardiovascular issues associated with TRT have been clarified by recent studies showing that therapy associated with clear increases in serum testosterone levels to the normal range is associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Studies reporting to show increased risk have been subject to flawed designs with inadequate baseline diagnosis and follow-up testing. Effectively, they have compared non-treated patients with under-treated or non-compliant subjects involving a range of different therapy regimes. Recent evidence suggests long-acting injections may be associated with decreased cardiovascular risk, but the transdermal route may be associated with potentially relatively greater risk because of conversion to dihydrotestosterone by the effect of 5-alpha reductase in skin. The multiple effects of TRT may add up to a considerable benefit to the patient that might be underestimated by the physician primarily concerned with his own specialty. In a response to concerns about the possible risks associated with inappropriate prescribing expressed by Public Citizen, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a complete refutation of all the concerns, only to issue a subsequent bulletin of concern over inappropriate use, whilst confirming the benefits in treating men with established testosterone deficiency. No additional evidence was provided for this apparent change of opinion, but longer term safety data on testosterone products were strongly suggested. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), in November 2014, concluded that “there is no consistent evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with testosterone products”. This paper explores the most recent evidence surrounding the benefits and risks associated with TRT.",[],Drug safety,2015-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Hackett', 'firstname': 'G I', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s40264-015-0348-y,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dcd25a40>,,,,,,
494,26402923,Single dose testosterone administration alleviates gaze avoidance in women with Social Anxiety Disorder.,"Gaze avoidance is one of the most characteristic and persistent social features in people with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). It signals social submissiveness and hampers adequate social interactions. Patients with SAD typically show reduced testosterone levels, a hormone that facilitates socially dominant gaze behavior. Therefore we tested as a proof of principle whether single dose testosterone administration can reduce gaze avoidance in SAD. In a double-blind, within-subject design, 18 medication-free female participants with SAD and 19 female healthy control participants received a single dose of 0.5mg testosterone and a matched placebo, at two separate days. On each day, their spontaneous gaze behavior was recorded using eye-tracking, while they looked at angry, happy, and neutral facial expressions. Testosterone enhanced the percentage of first fixations to the eye-region in participants with SAD compared to healthy controls. In addition, SAD patients' initial gaze avoidance in the placebo condition was associated with more severe social anxiety symptoms and this relation was no longer present after testosterone administration. These findings indicate that single dose testosterone administration can alleviate gaze avoidance in SAD. They support theories on the dominance enhancing effects of testosterone and extend those by showing that effects are particularly strong in individuals featured by socially submissive behavior. The finding that this core characteristic of SAD can be directly influenced by single dose testosterone administration calls for future inquiry into the clinical utility of testosterone in the treatment of SAD.","['Eye movements', 'Gaze avoidance', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Social Phobia', 'Social status', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2015-09-25,"[{'lastname': 'Enter', 'firstname': 'Dorien', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Radboud University Nijmegen, Behavioural Science Institute (BSI), 6500 HE, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, 6525 EN, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Leiden University, Institute of Psychology, 2300 RB, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Level 1 trauma center at a university hospital.
Consecutive sample of men with severe TBI between 2004 and 2009.
Prospective cohort study.
Post-TBI blood samples were collected during week 1, every 2 weeks until 26 weeks, and at 52 weeks. Serum hormone levels were measured, and individuals were designated as having PHH if 50% or more of samples met criteria for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. At 6 and 12 months postinjury, we assessed global outcome, disability, functional cognition, depression, and quality of life.
We recruited 78 men; median (interquartile range) age was 28.5 (22-42) years. Thirty-four patients (44%) had PHH during the first year postinjury. Multivariable regression, controlling for age, demonstrated PHH status predicted worse global outcome scores, more disability, and reduced functional cognition at 6 and 12 months post-TBI. Two-step testosterone screening for PHH at 12 to 16 weeks postinjury yielded a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%.

496,26358173,Testosterone in women--the clinical significance.,"Testosterone is an essential hormone for women, with physiological actions mediated directly or via aromatisation to oestradiol throughout the body. Despite the crucial role of testosterone and the high circulating concentrations of this hormone relative to oestradiol in women, studies of its action and the effects of testosterone deficiency and replacement in women are scarce. The primary indication for the prescription of testosterone for women is loss of sexual desire, which causes affected women substantial concern. That no formulation has been approved for this purpose has not impeded the widespread use of testosterone by women--either off-label or as compounded therapy. Observational studies indicate that testosterone has favourable cardiovascular effects measured by surrogate outcomes; however, associations between endogenous testosterone and the risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality, particularly in older women, are yet to be established. Adverse cardiovascular effects have not been seen in studies of transdermal testosterone therapy in women. Clinical trials suggest that exogenous testosterone enhances cognitive performance and improves musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women. Unmet needs include the availability of approved testosterone formulations for women and studies to elucidate the contribution of testosterone to cardiovascular, cognitive, and musculoskeletal health and the risk of cancer.",[],The lancet.

497,26356040,Digit ratio (2D:4D) and psychopathic traits moderate the effect of exogenous testosterone on socio-cognitive processes in men.,"Recent evidence suggests that testosterone is negatively correlated with empathic processes in both men and women. Also, administration of testosterone to young women impairs socio-cognitive performance as assessed using the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task"", especially among those exposed to elevated testosterone concentrations prenatally. However, the extent to which testosterone plays a similar causal role in socio-cognitive abilities in men is currently unknown. Here, using a crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design, we investigated the extent to which a single administration of testosterone to healthy young men (N=30) would impair socio-cognitive abilities assessed using the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task"" (RMET). Also, we investigated whether individual differences in 2D:4D ratio and psychopathic traits would moderate the effect of testosterone on task performance. Results indicated that testosterone administration on its own did not impair RMET performance. However, variability in both 2D:4D ratio and psychopathic traits moderated the effect of testosterone on task performance. Specifically, testosterone impaired RMET performance among individuals with relatively low (i.e., masculinized) 2D:4D ratio and among individuals scoring relatively low on the interpersonal/affective facet (i.e., Factor 1) of psychopathy. Our findings highlight the importance of considering theoretically- and empirically-based individual difference factors when attempting to characterize the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying socio-cognitive processes.","['2D:4D ratio', 'Empathic abilities', 'Psychopathic traits', 'Testosterone']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2015-09-12,"[{'lastname': 'Carré', 'firstname': 'Justin M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Nipissing University, North Bay, Canada.

498,26345685,Sexual dichotomy of gonadal function in Prader-Willi syndrome from early infancy through the fourth decade.,"At what age does the type of hypogonadism, namely hypothalamic or primary gonadal defect, become established in men and women with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)?
The type of hypogonadism becomes established only in late adolescence and early adulthood.
The etiology of hypogonadism in PWS is heterogeneous and the clinical expression is variable. Primary testicular failure is common in PWS men, while combinations of ovarian dysfunction and gonadotrophin deficiency are seen in women.
This is a prospective study of a cohort of 106 PWS patients followed for a mean duration of 4.5 years. Serial blood samples were obtained and assayed for gonadotrophins, inhibin B, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone (males), and estradiol (females). Results were compared with normal reference values obtained from the literature. For the purpose of this study, we defined the following age groups: infants <1 year; children 1-10 years; adolescents 11-20 years and adults >20 years.
Study participants were 49 males (aged 2 months to 36 years) and 57 females (aged 1 month to 37 years) with genetically confirmed diagnoses of PWS (deletions 60, uniparental disomy 54, imprinting center defect 2) followed in the Israel national multidisciplinary PWS clinic.
Serum LH levels were in the normal range (1.0-6.0 mIU/ml) for 7/10 adult men, and high in 3, while FSH (normal range 1.0-6.1 mIU/ml) was elevated (34.4 ± 11.5 mIU/ml) in 6 and normal (3.5 ± 1.6 mIU/ml) in 4 men. Testosterone was low (5.7 ± 3.4 nmol/l) compared with the normal range of 12.0-34.5 nmol/l in the reference population in all men >20 years. AMH showed a normal decrease with age, despite low testosterone levels. Inhibin B was normal (241 ± 105 pg/ml) in infant boys, but low or undetectable in most adult men. Hormonal profiles were more heterogeneous in women than in men. Estradiol was consistently detectable in only 7/13 adult women. Inhibin B was low or undetectable in all PWS females although occasional samples showed levels within the normal range of 15-95 pg/ml. Vaginal bleeding was reported to occur for the first time in eight women at a median age of 20 years (13-34 years), but only one had regular monthly menses. The type of hypogonadism (primary or secondary) in PWS can be determined only after age 20 years.
The study cohort was heterogeneous, showing variability in BMI, cognitive disability and medical treatment.
Demonstration of the natural history of reproductive hormone development in PWS suggests that androgen replacement may be indicated for most PWS boys in mid-adolescence. Recommendations for hormone replacement in PWS women need to be individually tailored, serial measurements of inhibin B should be performed, and contraception should be considered in those women who may have the potential for fertility.","['Prader–Willi syndrome', 'anti-Mullerian hormone', 'delayed puberty', 'gonadotrophins', 'hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism', 'hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism', 'inhibin B', 'primary ovarian insufficiency', 'primary testicular failure']","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",2015-09-09,"[{'lastname': 'Hirsch', 'firstname': 'H J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Neuropediatric Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel Department of Pediatrics, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel hirschmd@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Eldar-Geva', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Neuropediatric Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel Reproductive Endocrinology and Genetics Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center and The Hebrew University School of Medicine, Jerusalem 91031, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Bennaroch', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'The Herman Dana Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Pollak', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Neuropediatric Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel The School of Education, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91031, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Gross-Tsur', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Neuropediatric Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel Department of Pediatrics, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel The Hebrew University School of Medicine, Jerusalem 91031, Israel.'}]",,,,"© The Author 2015.

12954659",Content Validity of the Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire (HIS-Q): A Patient-Reported Outcome Measure to Evaluate Symptoms of Hypogonadism.,"Hypogonadism, or low testosterone, is a common disorder. There are currently no patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments designed to comprehensively evaluate the symptoms of hypogonadism and to detect changes in these symptoms in response to treatment.
The purpose of this study was to develop a PRO instrument, the Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire (HIS-Q) and to assess its content validity.
A literature review, expert clinician input, and qualitative concept elicitation with 39 male hypogonadism patients (four focus groups: n = 25; individual interviews: n = 14; mean age 52.3 ± 14.3 years) from the USA were used to develop the draft HIS-Q. Subsequent cognitive interviews (n = 29; mean age 51.5 ± 15.4 years) were used to evaluate content validity.
Emergent discussion with participants yielded symptoms within the sexual, physical, energy, sleep, cognition, and mood domains. Low libido and tiredness were most commonly reported. The initial version of the HIS-Q includes 53 items that were consistently understood by the participants, who found the instrument to be relevant to their experiences with hypogonadism and comprehensive in the content coverage of symptoms.
