0,38295775,Sex and Socioeconomic Disparities in Dementia Risk: A Population Attributable Fractions Analysis in Argentina.,"INTRODUCTION, twelve modifiable risk factors (RF) account for 40% of dementia cases worldwide. However, limited data exists on such factors in middle- and low-income countries. We aimed to estimate the population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for the 12 RF in Argentina, assessing changes over a decade, and exploring socioeconomic and sex influences. METHODS, we conducted cross-sectional analyses of the 12 RF from Argentinian surveys conducted in 2009, 2015, and 2018, including 96,321 people. We calculated PAFs, and stratified estimates based on sex and income. RESULTS, we estimated an overall PAF of 59.6%(95%CI=58.9%-60.3%). The largest PAFs were hypertension=9.3%(8.7%-9.9%), physical inactivity=7.4%(6.8%-8.2%), and obesity=7.4%(6.8%-7.9%). Men were more impacted by excessive alcohol, while women by isolation and smoking. Lower income linked to higher PAFs in education, hypertension, and obesity. DISCUSSION, Argentina has a higher PAF for dementia than the world population, with distinct RF distribution. PAF varied by sex and economic status, advocating tailored prevention strategies.",[],Neuroepidemiology,2024-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Calandri', 'firstname': 'Ismael Luis', 'initials': 'IL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Livingston', 'firstname': 'Gill', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Paradela', 'firstname': 'Regina', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ossenkoppele', 'firstname': 'Rik', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Crivelli', 'firstname': 'Lucia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Allegri', 'firstname': 'Ricardo F', 'initials': 'RF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Suemoto', 'firstname': 'Claudia K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"The Author(s).

31198655",Undiagnosed Cirrhosis and Hepatic Encephalopathy in a National Cohort of Veterans With Dementia.,"Dementia and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) are challenging to distinguish clinically. Undiagnosed cirrhosis in a patient with dementia can lead to missed opportunities to treat HE.
To examine the prevalence and risk factors of undiagnosed cirrhosis and therefore possible HE in veterans with dementia.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2009 and 2019 using data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and 2 separate validation cohorts from the Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Data analysis was conducted from May 20 to October 15, 2023. Participants included 177 422 US veterans with a diagnosis of dementia at 2 or more clinic visits, no prior diagnosis of cirrhosis, and with sufficient laboratory test results to calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score.
Demographic and clinical characteristics.
An FIB-4 score (>2.67 suggestive of advanced fibrosis and >3.25 suggestive of cirrhosis), capped at age 65 years even for those above this cutoff who were included in the analysis.
Among 177 422 veterans (97.1% men; 80.7% White; mean (SD) age, 78.35 [10.97] years) 5.3% (n = 9373) had an FIB-4 score greater than 3.25 and 10.3% (n = 18 390) had an FIB-4 score greater than 2.67. In multivariable logistic regression models, FIB-4 greater than 3.25 was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09), male gender (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.26-1.61), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.43-1.54), viral hepatitis (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.66-1.91), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.44-1.68), and chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17), and inversely associated with White race (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.85), diabetes (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84), hyperlipidemia (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89), stroke (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.91), tobacco use disorder (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87), and rural residence (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97). Similar findings were associated with the FIB-4 greater than 2.67 threshold. These codes were associated with cirrhosis on local validation. A local validation cohort of patients with dementia showed a similar percentage of high FIB-4 scores (4.4%-11.2%).
The findings of this cohort study suggest that clinicians encountering patients with dementia should be encouraged to screen for cirrhosis using the FIB-4 score to uncover reversible factors associated with cognitive impairment, such as HE, to enhance outcomes.",[],JAMA network open,2024-01-31,"[{'lastname': 'Bajaj', 'firstname': 'Jasmohan S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\nRichmond VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.'}, {'lastname': 'Silvey', 'firstname': 'Scott G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Richmond VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.'}, {'lastname': 'Rogal', 'firstname': 'Shari', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nPittsburgh VA Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Leary"", 'firstname': 'Jacqueline G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Dallas VA Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Patton', 'firstname': 'Heather', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, San Diego VA Medical Center, San Diego, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Morgan', 'firstname': 'Timothy R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Medical Service, VA Long Beach Healthcare System, Long Beach, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanagalingam', 'firstname': 'Gowthami', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\nRichmond VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gentili', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Richmond VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.\nDivision of Geriatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.'}, {'lastname': 'Godschalk', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Richmond VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.\nDivision of Geriatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Nilang', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\nRichmond VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.'}]",,,"Among 177 422 veterans (97.1% men; 80.7% White; mean (SD) age, 78.35 [10.97] years) 5.3% (n = 9373) had an FIB-4 score greater than 3.25 and 10.3% (n = 18 390) had an FIB-4 score greater than 2.67.

2,38293048,Dementia risk factors in former contact sports participants: prospective cohort study.,"The elevated dementia incidence in retired contact sport participants might be explained by a higher prevalence of established risk factors for the disease relative to the general population.
In this cohort study, former elite participants active between 1920 and 1965 in soccer (N=303), boxing (N=281), and wrestling (N=318) were recruited using sports yearbooks and records of sports associations. Men in a population control group were identified using records from a compulsory medical examination (N=1712). All study members were linked to hospital registers (1970-2015) and self-completion questionnaires were circulated (1985, 1995) from which we captured data on nine established risk factors for dementia: hypertension and diabetes status, alcohol intake, loneliness, depressive symptoms, cigarette smoking, body weight, educational attainment, and physical activity.
There was little suggestion that former participants in contact sports had a higher prevalence of dementia risk factors relative to the general population. Rather, the balance of evidence was for more favourable risk factor levels in former athletes, as was particularly evident for ever having smoked cigarettes (range in odds ratios [95% confidence interval]: 0.32 [0.21, 0.48] for wrestling to 0.52 [0.36, 0.75] for soccer) and leisure-time physical activity (range in beta coefficients [95% confidence interval]: 1.34 [0.66, 2.02] for soccer to 1.80 [1.07, 2.52] for boxing).
The increased dementia rates in retired contact sport participants evident in epidemiological studies is unlikely to be explained by the risk factors examined here. This implicates other characteristics of contact sports, including a history of repeated head impact.",[],medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024-01-31,"[{'lastname': 'Batty', 'firstname': 'G David', 'initials': 'GD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bell', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kujala', 'firstname': 'Urho M', 'initials': 'UM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sarna', 'firstname': 'Seppo J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kaprio', 'firstname': 'Jaakko', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,"There was little suggestion that former participants in contact sports had a higher prevalence of dementia risk factors relative to the general population.

4,38245248,The epidemiology of Parkinson's disease.,"The epidemiology of Parkinson's disease shows marked variations in time, geography, ethnicity, age, and sex. Internationally, prevalence has increased over and above demographic changes. There are several potential reasons for this increase, including the decline in other competing causes of death. Whether incidence is increasing, especially in women or in many low-income and middle-income countries where there is a shortage of high-quality data, is less certain. Parkinson's disease is more common in older people and men, and a variety of environmental factors have been suggested to explain why, including exposure to neurotoxic agents. Within countries, there appear to be ethnic differences in disease risk, although these differences might reflect differential access to health care. The cause of Parkinson's disease is multifactorial, and involves genetic and environmental factors. Both risk factors (eg, pesticides) and protective factors (eg, physical activity and tendency to smoke) have been postulated to have a role in Parkinson's disease, although elucidating causality is complicated by the long prodromal period. Following the establishment of public health strategies to prevent cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and dementia are gaining a deserved higher priority. Multipronged prevention strategies are required that tackle population-based primary prevention, high-risk targeted secondary prevention, and Parkinson's disease-modifying therapies for tertiary prevention. Future international collaborations will be required to triangulate evidence from basic, applied, and epidemiological research, thereby enhancing the understanding and prevention of Parkinson's disease at a global level.",[],"Lancet (London, England)",2024-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Ben-Shlomo', 'firstname': 'Yoav', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.

5,38232335,Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Population-Attributable Fractions of Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias.,"Previous studies estimated that modifiable risk factors explain up to 40% of the dementia cases in the United States and that this population-attributable fraction (PAF) differs by race and ethnicity-estimates of future impact based on the risk factor prevalence in contemporary surveys. The aim of this study was to determine the race-specific and ethnicity-specific PAF of late-onset Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs) based on the risk factor prevalence and associations observed on the same individuals within a prospective cohort.
Data were from Multiethnic Cohort Study participants (African American, Japanese American, Latino, Native Hawaiian, and White) enrolled in Medicare Fee-for-Service. We estimated the PAF based on the prevalence of risk factors at cohort baseline and their mutually adjusted association with subsequent ADRD incidence. Risk factors included low educational attainment and midlife exposures to low neighborhood socioeconomic status, unmarried status, history of hypertension, stroke, diabetes or heart disease, smoking, physical inactivity, short or long sleep duration, obesity, and low-quality diet, as well as 
Among 91,881 participants (mean age 59.3 at baseline, 55.0% female participants), 16,507 incident ADRD cases were identified from Medicare claims (1999-2016, mean follow-up 9.3 years). The PAF for nongenetic factors combined was similar in men (24.0% [95% CI 21.3-26.6]) and women (22.8% [20.3-25.2]) but varied across Japanese American (14.2% [11.1-17.2]), White (21.9% [19.0-24.7]), African American (27.8% [22.3-33.0]), Native Hawaiian (29.3% [21.0-36.7]), and Latino (33.3% [27.5-38.5]) groups. The combined PAF was attenuated when accounting for competing risk of death, in both men (10.4%) and women (13.9%) and across racial and ethnic groups (4.7%-25.5%). The combined PAF was also different by age at diagnosis and ADRD subtypes, higher for younger (65-74 years: 43.2%) than older (75-84 years: 32.4%; ≥85 years: 11.3%) diagnoses and higher for vascular or unspecified ADRD than for AD or Lewy body dementia.

29967939",Digital Clock Drawing as an Alzheimer's Disease Susceptibility Biomarker: Associations with Genetic Risk Score and APOE in Older Adults.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, but most people are not diagnosed until significant neuronal loss has likely occurred along with a decline in cognition. Non-invasive and cost-effective digital biomarkers for AD have the potential to improve early detection.
We examined the validity of DCTclockTM (a digitized clock drawing task) as an AD susceptibility biomarker.
We used two primary independent variables, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele carrier status and polygenic risk score (PRS). We examined APOE and PRS associations with DCTclockTM composite scores as dependent measures.
We used existing data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a community-based study with the largest dataset of digital clock drawing data to date.
The sample consisted of 2,398 older adults ages 60-94 with DCTclockTM data (mean age of 72.3, 55% female and 92% White).
PRS was calculated using 38 variants identified in a recent large genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis of late-onset AD (LOAD).
Results showed that DCTclockTM performance decreased with advancing age, lower education, and the presence of one or more copies of APOE ε4. Lower DCTclockTM Total Score as well as lower composite scores for Information Processing Speed (both command and copy conditions) and Drawing Efficiency (command condition) were significantly associated with higher PRS levels and more copies of APOE ε4. APOE and PRS associations displayed similar effect sizes in both men and women.
Our results indicate that higher AD genetic risk is associated with poorer DCTclockTM performance in older adults without dementia. This is the first study to demonstrate significant differences in clock drawing performance on the basis of APOE status or PRS.","['APOE', 'Genetics\n', 'clock drawing test', 'cognitive screening', 'digital biomarkers', 'polygenic risk score']",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2024-01-17,"[{'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'L I', 'initials': 'LI', 'affiliation': 'Louisa Thompson, Department of Psychiatry, Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI.

36183084",Exposure to residential green and blue space and the natural environment is associated with a lower incidence of psychiatric disorders in middle-aged and older adults: findings from the UK Biobank.,"There is increasing evidence for the role of environmental factors and exposure to the natural environment on a wide range of health outcomes. Whether exposure to green space, blue space, and the natural environment (GBN) is associated with risk of psychiatric disorders in middle-aged and older adults has not been prospectively examined.
Longitudinal data from the UK biobank was used. At the study baseline (2006-2010), 363,047 participants (women: 53.4%; mean age 56.7 ± 8.1 years) who had not been previously diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder were included. Follow-up was achieved by collecting records from hospitals and death registers. Measurements of green and blue space modeled from land use data and natural environment from Land Cover Map were assigned to the residential address for each participant. Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for potential confounders were used to explore the longitudinal associations between GBN and any psychiatric disorder and then by specific psychiatric disorders (dementia, substance abuse, psychotic disorder, depression, and anxiety) in middle-aged and older adults.
During an average follow-up of 11.5 ± 2.8 years, 49,865 individuals were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Compared with the first tertile (lowest) of exposure, blue space at 300 m buffer [hazard ratio (HR): 0.973, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.952-0.994] and natural environment at 300 m buffer (HR: 0.970, 95% CI: 0.948-0.992) and at 1000 m buffer (HR: 0.975, 95% CI: 0.952-0.999) in the third tertile (highest) were significantly associated with lower risk of incident psychiatric disorders, respectively. The risk of incident dementia was statistically decreased when exposed to the third tertile (highest) of green space and natural environment at 1000 m buffer. The third tertile (highest) of green space at 300 m and 1000 m buffer and natural environment at 300 m and 1000 m buffer was associated with a reduction of 30.0%, 31.8%, 21.7%, and 30.3% in the risk of developing a psychotic disorder, respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that the elderly, men, and those living with some comorbid conditions may derive greater benefits associated with exposure to GBN.
This study suggests that GBN has significant benefits for lowering the risk of psychiatric disorders in middle-aged and older adults. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings and to understand the potential mechanistic pathways underpinning these novel findings.","['Blue space', 'Green space', 'Natural environment', 'Psychiatric disorder', 'UK Biobank']",BMC medicine,2024-01-15,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Bao-Peng', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huxley', 'firstname': 'Rachel R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health, Deakin University, Melbourne, VIC, 3000, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Schikowski', 'firstname': 'Tamara', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, Düsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Ke-Jia', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Big Data in Health Science, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Qi', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. qi.zhao@sdu.edu.cn.\nFaculty of Health, Deakin University, Melbourne, VIC, 3000, Australia. qi.zhao@sdu.edu.cn.\nShandong University Climate Change and Health Center, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. qi.zhao@sdu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Jia', 'firstname': 'Cun-Xian', 'initials': 'CX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. jiacunxian@sdu.edu.cn.'}]",,,"During an average follow-up of 11.5 ± 2.8 years, 49,865 individuals were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.

31697831",Prioritizing determinants of cognitive function in healthy middle-aged and older adults: insights from a machine learning regression approach in the Canadian longitudinal study on aging.,"The preservation of healthy cognitive function is a crucial step toward reducing the growing burden of cognitive decline and impairment. Our study aims to identify the characteristics of an individual that play the greatest roles in determining healthy cognitive function in mid to late life.
Data on the characteristics of an individual that influence their health, also known as determinants of health, were extracted from the baseline cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (2015). Cognitive function was a normalized latent construct score summarizing eight cognitive tests administered as a neuropsychological battery by CLSA staff. A higher cognitive function score indicated better functioning. A penalized regression model was used to select and order determinants based on their strength of association with cognitive function. Forty determinants (40) were entered into the model including demographic and socioeconomic factors, lifestyle and health behaviors, clinical measures, chronic diseases, mental health status, social support and the living environment.
The study sample consisted mainly of White, married, men and women aged 45-64 years residing in urban Canada. Mean overall cognitive function score for the study sample was 99.5, with scores ranging from 36.6 to 169.2 (lowest to highest cognitive function). Thirty-five (35) determinants were retained in the final model as significantly associated with healthy cognitive functioning. The determinants demonstrating the strongest associations with healthy cognitive function, were race, immigrant status, nutritional risk, community belongingness, and satisfaction with life. The determinants demonstrating the weakest associations with healthy cognitive function, were physical activity, greenness and neighborhood deprivation.
Greater prioritization and integration of demographic and socioeconomic factors and lifestyle and health behaviors, such greater access to healthy foods and enhancing aid programs for low-income and immigrant families, into future health interventions and policies can produce the greatest gains in preserving healthy cognitive function in mid to late life.","['CLSA', 'cognitive function', 'dementia prevention', 'determinants of health', 'machine learning']",Frontiers in public health,2024-01-08,"[{'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhong', 'firstname': 'Shiran', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geography, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Rogers', 'firstname': 'Kem', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hachinski', 'firstname': 'Vladimir', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Clinical Neurological Sciences, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Frisbee', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.'}]",,"Greater prioritization and integration of demographic and socioeconomic factors and lifestyle and health behaviors, such greater access to healthy foods and enhancing aid programs for low-income and immigrant families, into future health interventions and policies can produce the greatest gains in preserving healthy cognitive function in mid to late life.","The study sample consisted mainly of White, married, men and women aged 45-64 years residing in urban Canada.

31177182",Comparison of multiple linear regression and machine learning methods in predicting cognitive function in older Chinese type 2 diabetes patients.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased dramatically in recent decades, and there are increasing indications that dementia is related to T2D. Previous attempts to analyze such relationships principally relied on traditional multiple linear regression (MLR). However, recently developed machine learning methods (Mach-L) outperform MLR in capturing non-linear relationships. The present study applied four different Mach-L methods to analyze the relationships between risk factors and cognitive function in older T2D patients, seeking to compare the accuracy between MLR and Mach-L in predicting cognitive function and to rank the importance of risks factors for impaired cognitive function in T2D.
We recruited older T2D between 60-95 years old without other major comorbidities. Demographic factors and biochemistry data were used as independent variables and cognitive function assessment (CFA) was conducted using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment as an independent variable. In addition to traditional MLR, we applied random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), Naïve Byer's classifier (NB) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).
Totally, the test cohort consisted of 197 T2D (98 men and 99 women). Results showed that all ML methods outperformed MLR, with symmetric mean absolute percentage errors for MLR, RF, SGB, NB and XGBoost respectively of 0.61, 0.599, 0.606, 0.599 and 0.2139. Education level, age, frailty score, fasting plasma glucose and body mass index were identified as key factors in descending order of importance.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that RF, SGB, NB and XGBoost are more accurate than MLR for predicting CFA score, and identify education level, age, frailty score, fasting plasma glucose, body fat and body mass index as important risk factors in an older Chinese T2D cohort.","['Cognitive function', 'Machine learning', 'Type 2 diabetes']",BMC neurology,2024-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chi-Hao', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Chung-Hsin', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Cardinal Tien Hospital, School of Medicine, Fu-Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Li-Ying', 'initials': 'LY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Medical Education, Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Fang-Yu', 'initials': 'FY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuo', 'firstname': 'Chun-Heng', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Chung-Ze', 'initials': 'CZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Shuang Ho Hospital, New Taipei City, 23561, R.O.C.\nDivision of Endocrinology and Metabolism, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan, R.O.C.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Yu-Fang', 'initials': 'YF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Changhua Christian Hospital, 135 Nanhsiao Street, Changhua City, 50006, Taiwan, R.O.C.. cch143989@gmail.com.\nDepartment of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.. cch143989@gmail.com.'}]",,"In conclusion, our study demonstrated that RF, SGB, NB and XGBoost are more accurate than MLR for predicting CFA score, and identify education level, age, frailty score, fasting plasma glucose, body fat and body mass index as important risk factors in an older Chinese T2D cohort.","Totally, the test cohort consisted of 197 T2D (98 men and 99 women).

10,38165330,Association of Vascular Risk Factors and CSF and Imaging Biomarkers With White Matter Hyperintensities in Former American Football Players.,"Recent data link exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHIs) from American football with increased white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. WMH might have unique characteristics in the context of RHI beyond vascular risk and normal aging processes. We evaluated biological correlates of WMH in former American football players, including markers of amyloid, tau, inflammation, axonal injury, neurodegeneration, and vascular health.
Participants underwent clinical interviews, MRI, and lumbar puncture as part of the Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Research Project. Structural equation modeling tested direct and indirect effects between log-transformed total fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion volumes (TLV) and the revised Framingham stroke risk profile (rFSRP), MRI-derived global metrics of cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA), and CSF levels of amyloid β
In 180 former football players (mean age = 57.2, 36% Black), higher log(TLV) had direct associations with the following: higher rFSRP score (B = 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.40), higher p-tau

11,38155477,Association between structural brain MRI abnormalities and epilepsy in older adults.,"To determine the association between brain MRI abnormalities and incident epilepsy in older adults.
Men and women (ages 45-64 years) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were followed up from 1987 to 2018 with brain MRI performed between 2011 and 2013. We identified cases of incident late-onset epilepsy (LOE) with onset of seizures occurring after the acquisition of brain MRI. We evaluated the relative pattern of cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and white matter integrity among participants with incident LOE after MRI in comparison with participants without seizures. We examined the association between MRI abnormalities and incident LOE using Cox proportional hazards regression. Models were adjusted for demographics, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, stroke, and dementia status.
Among 1251 participants with brain MRI data, 27 (2.2%) developed LOE after MRI over a median of 6.4 years (25-75 percentile 5.8-6.9) of follow-up.

35715891",Risk Factors for Young-Onset Dementia in the UK Biobank.,"There is limited information on modifiable risk factors for young-onset dementia (YOD).
To examine factors that are associated with the incidence of YOD.
This prospective cohort study used data from the UK Biobank, with baseline assessment between 2006 and 2010 and follow-up until March 31, 2021, for England and Scotland, and February 28, 2018, for Wales. Participants younger than 65 years and without a dementia diagnosis at baseline assessment were included in this study. Participants who were 65 years and older and those with dementia at baseline were excluded. Data were analyzed from May 2022 to April 2023.
A total of 39 potential risk factors were identified from systematic reviews of late-onset dementia and YOD risk factors and grouped into domains of sociodemographic factors (education, socioeconomic status, and sex), genetic factors (apolipoprotein E), lifestyle factors (physical activity, alcohol use, alcohol use disorder, smoking, diet, cognitive activity, social isolation, and marriage), environmental factors (nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, pesticide, and diesel), blood marker factors (vitamin D, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate function, and albumin), cardiometabolic factors (stroke, hypertension, diabetes, hypoglycemia, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and aspirin use), psychiatric factors (depression, anxiety, benzodiazepine use, delirium, and sleep problems), and other factors (traumatic brain injury, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid dysfunction, hearing impairment, and handgrip strength).
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the association between the risk factors and incidence of YOD. Factors were tested stepwise first within domains and then across domains.
Of 356 052 included participants, 197 036 (55.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age at baseline was 54.6 (7.0) years. During 2 891 409 person-years of follow-up, 485 incident YOD cases (251 of 485 men [51.8%]) were observed, yielding an incidence rate of 16.8 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 15.4-18.3). In the final model, 15 factors were significantly associated with a higher YOD risk, namely lower formal education, lower socioeconomic status, carrying 2 apolipoprotein ε4 allele, no alcohol use, alcohol use disorder, social isolation, vitamin D deficiency, high C-reactive protein levels, lower handgrip strength, hearing impairment, orthostatic hypotension, stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and depression.
In this study, several factors, mostly modifiable, were associated with a higher risk of YOD. These modifiable risk factors should be incorporated in future dementia prevention initiatives and raise new therapeutic possibilities for YOD.",[],JAMA neurology,2023-12-26,"[{'lastname': 'Hendriks', 'firstname': 'Stevie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ranson', 'firstname': 'Janice M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Peetoom', 'firstname': 'Kirsten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Lourida', 'firstname': 'Ilianna', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Tai', 'firstname': 'Xin You', 'initials': 'XY', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'de Vugt', 'firstname': 'Marjolein', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Llewellyn', 'firstname': 'David J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nAlan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Köhler', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.'}]",,,"Of 356 052 included participants, 197 036 (55.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age at baseline was 54.6 (7.0) years.

30820070","Mortality Trends in Alzheimer's Disease in Mississippi, 2011-2021.","Alzheimer's disease is the sixth most common cause of death in the United States (U.S.), with one in three adults 65 years of age and older dying of the disease each year. Deaths from Alzheimer's have more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, killing more adults than both breast cancer and prostate cancer. In 2021, Alzheimer's disease resulted in 36 deaths per 100,000 in the U.S. In Mississippi, deaths from Alzheimer's have almost doubled between 2011 and 2021, resulting in 52.9 deaths per 100,000. Women have a higher mortality rate from Alzheimer's than men. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease that develops through seven stages. There are effective strategies to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's.
This paper reviews the risk factors, mortality trends, etiology, and prognosis of Alzheimer's in Mississippi with a focus on prevention.
The southern diet with foods high in sugar and sodium, along with sedentary and poor lifestyle choices, increases mortality risk from Alzheimer's disease for women in Mississippi, specifically due to women over 65 having higher rates of obesity and hypertension.
Understanding the epidemiology and risk factors of Alzheimer's in Mississippi will help inform communities, policies, and programs to prevent disease occurrence.","['Alzheimer’s', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'adults', 'death rates', 'dementia', 'mortality', 'seniors']","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-12-22,"[{'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth A K', 'initials': 'EAK', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39213, USA.\nJackson Heart Study Graduate Training & Education Center, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39213, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jenkins', 'firstname': 'Brenda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39213, USA.\nJackson Heart Study Graduate Training & Education Center, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39213, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Addison', 'firstname': 'Clifton', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39213, USA.\nJackson Heart Study Graduate Training & Education Center, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39213, USA.'}]",,"Understanding the epidemiology and risk factors of Alzheimer's in Mississippi will help inform communities, policies, and programs to prevent disease occurrence.","The southern diet with foods high in sugar and sodium, along with sedentary and poor lifestyle choices, increases mortality risk from Alzheimer's disease for women in Mississippi, specifically due to women over 65 having higher rates of obesity and hypertension.",,"10.3390/diseases11040179

31168739",Physicians' beliefs and perceived importance of traumatic brain injury-associated agitation in critically ill patients: a survey of Canadian intensivists.,"Agitation is a common behavioural problem following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intensive care unit (ICU) physicians' perspectives regarding TBI-associated agitation are unknown. Our objective was to describe physicians' beliefs and perceived importance of TBI-associated agitation in critically ill patients.
Following current standard guidance, we built an electronic, self-administrated, 42-item survey, pretested it for reliability and validity, and distributed it to 219 physicians working in 18 ICU level-1 trauma centres in Canada. We report the results using descriptive statistics.
The overall response rate was 93/219 (42%), and 76/93 (82%) respondents completed the full survey. Most respondents were men with ten or more years of experience. Respondents believed that pre-existing dementia (90%) and regular recreational drug use (86%) are risk factors for agitation. Concerning management, 91% believed that the use of physical restraints could worsen agitation, 90% believed that having family at the bedside reduces agitation, and 72% believed that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are efficacious for managing TBI agitation. Variability was observed in beliefs on epidemiology, sex, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and other pharmacologic options. Respondents considered TBI agitation frequent enough to justify the implementation of management protocols (87%), perceived the current level of clinical evidence on TBI agitation management to be insufficient (84%), and expressed concerns about acute and long-term detrimental outcomes and burden to patients, health care professionals, and relatives (85%).
Traumatic brain injury-associated agitation in critically ill patients was perceived as an important issue for most ICU physicians. Physicians agreed on multiple approaches to manage TBI-associated agitation although agreement on epidemiology and risk factors was variable.
RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: L’agitation est un problème de comportement courant à la suite d’un traumatisme crânien (TC). Le point de vue des médecins des unités de soins intensifs (USI) sur l’agitation associée aux traumatismes crâniens est inconnu. Notre objectif était de décrire les croyances et l’importance perçue par les médecins de l’agitation associée aux traumatismes crâniens chez les patient·es gravement malades. MéTHODE: Conformément aux lignes directrices standard actuelles, nous avons élaboré un sondage électronique auto-administré de 42 questions, l’avons testé au préalable pour en vérifier la fiabilité et la validité, et l’avons distribué à 219 médecins travaillant dans les USI de 18 centres de traumatologie de niveau 1 au Canada. Les résultats sont présentés à l’aide de statistiques descriptives. RéSULTATS: Le taux de réponse global a été de 93 sur 219 (42 %) et 76 sur 93 (82 %) personnes interrogées ont répondu à l’ensemble du sondage. La plupart des répondant·es étaient des hommes comptant dix ans ou plus d’expérience. Les répondant·es sont d’avis que la démence préexistante (90 %) et la consommation régulière de drogues à des fins récréatives (86 %) sont des facteurs de risque d’agitation. En ce qui concerne la prise en charge, 91 % des répondant·es estiment que l’utilisation de contentions physiques peut aggraver l’agitation, 90 % croient que le fait d’avoir de la famille au chevet du patient ou de la patiente réduit l’agitation et 72 % pensent que les agonistes alpha-2 adrénergiques sont efficaces pour gérer l’agitation causée par les traumatismes crâniens. Une variabilité a été observée dans les croyances concernant l’épidémiologie, le sexe, le genre, l’âge, le statut socio-économique et d’autres options pharmacologiques. Les répondant·es considéraient que l’agitation liée aux traumatismes crâniens était suffisamment fréquente pour justifier la mise en œuvre de protocoles de prise en charge (87 %), estimaient que le niveau actuel de données probantes cliniques sur la prise en charge de l’agitation causée par un traumatisme crânien était insuffisant (84 %), et se sont dit·es préoccupé·es par les conséquences préjudiciables aiguës et à long terme et par le fardeau pour les patient·es, les professionnel·les de la santé et les proches (85 %). CONCLUSION: L’agitation associée à un traumatisme crânien chez les patient·es gravement malades était perçue comme un problème important pour la plupart des médecins des soins intensifs. Les médecins s’entendaient sur plusieurs approches pour gérer l’agitation associée aux traumatismes crâniens, bien que l’accord sur l’épidémiologie et les facteurs de risque était variable.","['agitation', 'intensive care medicine', 'physicians', 'survey', 'traumatic brain injury']",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2023-12-22,"[{'lastname': 'Saavedra-Mitjans', 'firstname': 'Mar', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Pharmacy, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada. mar.saavedra.mitjans@umontreal.ca.\nResearch Center, Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services Sociaux du Nord-de-l'île-de-Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada. mar.saavedra.mitjans@umontreal.ca.""}, {'lastname': 'Frenette', 'firstname': 'Anne Julie', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Pharmacy, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Center, Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services Sociaux du Nord-de-l'île-de-Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nPharmacy Department, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'McCredie', 'firstname': 'Victoria A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University Health Network and Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nKrembil Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Burry', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nLeslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Arbour', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Research Center, Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services Sociaux du Nord-de-l'île-de-Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nFaculty of Nursing, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Sangeeta', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Sinai Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Charbonney', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Centre, Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Han Ting', 'initials': 'HT', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Centre, Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Albert', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Research Center, Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services Sociaux du Nord-de-l'île-de-Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nFaculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Bernard', 'firstname': 'Francis', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Research Center, Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services Sociaux du Nord-de-l'île-de-Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nFaculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Williamson', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Pharmacy, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nResearch Center, Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services Sociaux du Nord-de-l'île-de-Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.\nPharmacy Department, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""}]",,Traumatic brain injury-associated agitation in critically ill patients was perceived as an important issue for most ICU physicians.

27502450",Predicting positron emission tomography brain amyloid positivity using interpretable machine learning models with wearable sensor data and lifestyle factors.,"Developing a screening method for identifying individuals at higher risk of elevated brain amyloid burden is important to reduce costs and burden to patients in clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease or the clinical setting. We developed machine learning models using objectively measured lifestyle factors to predict elevated brain amyloid burden on positron emission tomography.
Our prospective cohort study of non-demented, community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 65 years was conducted from August 2015 to September 2019 in Usuki, Oita Prefecture, Japan. One hundred and twenty-two individuals with mild cognitive impairment or subjective memory complaints (54 men and 68 women, median age: 75.50 years) wore wearable sensors and completed self-reported questionnaires, cognitive test, and positron emission tomography imaging at baseline. Moreover, 99 individuals in the second year and 61 individuals in the third year were followed up. In total, 282 eligible records with valid wearable sensors, cognitive test results, and amyloid imaging and data on demographic characteristics, living environments, and health behaviors were used in the machine learning models. Amyloid positivity was defined as a standardized uptake value ratio of ≥ 1.4. Models were constructed using kernel support vector machine, Elastic Net, and logistic regression for predicting amyloid positivity. The mean score among 10 times fivefold cross-validation repeats was utilized for evaluation.
In Elastic Net, the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model using objectively measured lifestyle factors alone was 0.70, whereas that of the models using wearable sensors in combination with demographic characteristics and health and life environment questionnaires was 0.79. Moreover, 22 variables were common to all machine learning models.
Our machine learning models are useful for predicting elevated brain amyloid burden using readily-available and noninvasive variables without the need to visit a hospital.
This prospective study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee of Oita University Hospital (UMIN000017442). A written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This research was performed based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.","['Amyloid positivity', 'Lifestyle factors', 'Machine learning', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'PiB-PET', 'Wearable sensor']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2023-12-13,"[{'lastname': 'Kimura', 'firstname': 'Noriyuki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Idaigaoka 1-1, Hasama, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan. noriyuki@oita-u.ac.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Aota', 'firstname': 'Tomoki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Microbes & Host Defense Domain Deep Human Biology Learning, Eisai Co., Ltd, 5-1-3, Tokodai, Tsukuba-Shi, Ibaraki, 300-2635, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Aso', 'firstname': 'Yasuhiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Idaigaoka 1-1, Hasama, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yabuuchi', 'firstname': 'Kenichi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Idaigaoka 1-1, Hasama, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sasaki', 'firstname': 'Kotaro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Microbes & Host Defense Domain Deep Human Biology Learning, Eisai Co., Ltd, 5-1-3, Tokodai, Tsukuba-Shi, Ibaraki, 300-2635, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Masuda', 'firstname': 'Teruaki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Idaigaoka 1-1, Hasama, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Eguchi', 'firstname': 'Atsuko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Idaigaoka 1-1, Hasama, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Maeda', 'firstname': 'Yoshitaka', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Microbes & Host Defense Domain Deep Human Biology Learning, Eisai Co., Ltd, 5-1-3, Tokodai, Tsukuba-Shi, Ibaraki, 300-2635, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Aoshima', 'firstname': 'Ken', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Microbes & Host Defense Domain Deep Human Biology Learning, Eisai Co., Ltd, 5-1-3, Tokodai, Tsukuba-Shi, Ibaraki, 300-2635, Japan. k3-aoshima@hhc.eisai.co.jp.\nSchool of Integrative and Global Majors, University of Tsukuba, Tennoudai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan. k3-aoshima@hhc.eisai.co.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsubara', 'firstname': 'Etsuro', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Idaigaoka 1-1, Hasama, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan.'}]",,Our machine learning models are useful for predicting elevated brain amyloid burden using readily-available and noninvasive variables without the need to visit a hospital.,"In Elastic Net, the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model using objectively measured lifestyle factors alone was 0.70, whereas that of the models using wearable sensors in combination with demographic characteristics and health and life environment questionnaires was 0.79.

16,38007653,Sex and Sleep Disruption as Contributing Factors in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more women than men, with women throughout the menopausal transition potentially being the most under researched and at-risk group. Sleep disruptions, which are an established risk factor for AD, increase in prevalence with normal aging and are exacerbated in women during menopause. Sex differences showing more disrupted sleep patterns and increased AD pathology in women and female animal models have been established in literature, with much emphasis placed on loss of circulating gonadal hormones with age. Interestingly, increases in gonadotropins such as follicle stimulating hormone are emerging to be a major contributor to AD pathogenesis and may also play a role in sleep disruption, perhaps in combination with other lesser studied hormones. Several sleep influencing regions of the brain appear to be affected early in AD progression and some may exhibit sexual dimorphisms that may contribute to increased sleep disruptions in women with age. Additionally, some of the most common sleep disorders, as well as multiple health conditions that impair sleep quality, are more prevalent and more severe in women. These conditions are often comorbid with AD and have bi-directional relationships that contribute synergistically to cognitive decline and neuropathology. The association during aging of increased sleep disruption and sleep disorders, dramatic hormonal changes during and after menopause, and increased AD pathology may be interacting and contributing factors that lead to the increased number of women living with AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'hormones', 'menopause', 'sex differences', 'sleep', 'women']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-11-26,"[{'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Carrie E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'University of Kentucky, College of Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Lexington, KY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Duncan', 'firstname': 'Marilyn J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'University of Kentucky, College of Medicine, Department of Neuroscience, Lexington, KY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'M Paul', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'University of Kentucky, College of Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Lexington, KY, USA.\nUniversity of Kentucky, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, Lexington, KY, USA.'}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-230527,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dec6adb0>,,,,,,

36802440",Greater socioenvironmental risk factors and higher chronic pain stage are associated with thinner bilateral temporal lobes.,"Previous research indicates ethnic/race group differences in pain and neurodegenerative diseases. Accounting for socioenvironmental factors reduces ethnic/race group differences in clinical and experimental pain. In the current study sample, we previously reported that in individuals with knee pain, ethnic/race group differences were observed in bilateral temporal lobe thickness, areas of the brain associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias. The purpose of the study was to determine if socioenvironmental factors reduce or account for previously observed ethnic/race group differences and explore if a combined effect of socioenvironmental risk and chronic pain severity on temporal lobe cortices is evident.
Consistent with the prior study, the sample was comprised of 147 adults (95 women, 52 men), 45-85 years of age, who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (n = 72) and non-Hispanic White (n = 75), with knee pain with/at risk for osteoarthritis. Measures included demographics, health history, pain questionnaires, cognitive screening, body mass index, individual- and community-level socioenvironmental factors (education, income, household size, marital and insurance status, and area deprivation index), and brain imaging. We computed a summative socioenvironmental risk index.
Regression analyses showed that with the inclusion of socioenvironmental factors, the model was significant (p < .001), and sociodemographic (ethnic/race) group differences were not significant (p = .118). Additionally, findings revealed an additive stress load pattern indicating thinner temporal lobe cortices with greater socioenvironmental risk and chronic pain severity (p = .048).
Although individual socioenvironmental factors were not independent predictors, when collectively combined in models, ethnic/race group differences in bilateral temporal lobe structures were not replicated. Further, combined socioenvironmental risk factors and higher chronic pain severity were associated with thinner bilateral temporal lobes.","[""Alzheimer's disease risk"", 'brain imaging', 'chronic pain', 'health disparities', 'osteoarthritis']",Brain and behavior,2023-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Antoine', 'firstname': 'Lisa H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanner', 'firstname': 'Jared J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mickle', 'firstname': 'Angela M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\nDepartment of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Cesar E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kusko', 'firstname': 'Daniel A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Watts', 'firstname': 'Kristen Allen', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Heersink School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rumble', 'firstname': 'Deanna D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Counseling, University of Central Arkansas, Conway, Arkansas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Buchanan', 'firstname': 'Taylor L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Center for Exercise Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sims', 'firstname': 'Andrew M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Staud', 'firstname': 'Roland', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Song', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Deshpande', 'firstname': 'Hrishikesh', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Phillips', 'firstname': 'Brandis', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Accounting & Finance, North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Buford', 'firstname': 'Thomas W', 'initials': 'TW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine - Division of Gerontology, Geriatrics, and Palliative Care, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.\nBirmingham/Atlanta Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Birmingham VA Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aroke', 'firstname': 'Edwin N', 'initials': 'EN', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Redden', 'firstname': 'David T', 'initials': 'DT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fillingim', 'firstname': 'Roger B', 'initials': 'RB', 'affiliation': 'Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\nDepartment of Community of Dentistry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Goodin', 'firstname': 'Burel R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, Washington University, Washington University Pain Center, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sibille', 'firstname': 'Kimberly T', 'initials': 'KT', 'affiliation': 'Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\nDepartment of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.'}]",,,"Regression analyses showed that with the inclusion of socioenvironmental factors, the model was significant (p < .001), and sociodemographic (ethnic/race) group differences were not significant (p = .118).

18,37984339,Cardiovascular Disease Risk Scores and Incident Dementia and Cognitive Decline in Older Men and Women.,"Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) also increase the risk of dementia. However, whether commonly used CVD risk scores are associated with dementia risk in older adults who do not have a history of CVD, and potential gender differences in this association, remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether CVD risk scores are prospectively associated with cognitive decline and dementia in initially healthy older men and women.
19,114 participants from a prospective cohort of individuals aged 65+ years without known CVD or dementia at recruitment. The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score (ASCVDRS), Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation2- Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) and the Framingham risk score (FRS) were calculated at baseline. Risk of dementia (according to DSM-IV criteria) and cognitive decline (defined as a >1.5 standard deviation (SD) decline in global cognition, episodic memory, psychomotor speed or verbal fluency from the previous year) were assessed using Hazard Ratio (HR).
Over a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 850 individuals developed dementia and 4352 cognitive decline. Men and women in the highest ASCVDRS tertile had a 41% (95%CI 1.08,1.85) and 45% (1.11,1.89) increased risk of dementia compared to the lowest tertile respectively. Likewise, men and women in the highest SCORE2-OP tertile had a 64% (1.24,2.16) and 60% (1.22,2.11) increased risk of dementia compared to the lowest tertile respectively. Findings were similar but the risk was slightly lesser when examining risk of cognitive decline for both ASCVDRS and SCORE2-OP. However, FRS was only associated with the risk of cognitive decline among women (highest vs. lowest tertiles: 1.13 [1.01-1.26]).
These findings suggest the utility of the ASCVDRS and SCORE2-OP in clinical practice, to not only assess future risk of CVD, but also as potential early indicators of cognitive impairment, even in relatively healthy older men and women.",[],Gerontology,2023-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Vishwanath', 'firstname': 'Swarna', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hopper', 'firstname': 'Ingrid', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chowdhury', 'firstname': 'Enayet', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wolfe', 'firstname': 'Rory', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Freak-Poli', 'firstname': 'Rosanne', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Reid', 'firstname': 'Christopher M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tonkin', 'firstname': 'Andrew M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Murray', 'firstname': 'Anne M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Raj C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chong', 'firstname': 'Trevor T-J', 'initials': 'TT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Woods', 'firstname': 'Robyn L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McNeil', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Orchard', 'firstname': 'Suzanne G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'Mark R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Steves', 'firstname': 'Claire J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,"These findings suggest the utility of the ASCVDRS and SCORE2-OP in clinical practice, to not only assess future risk of CVD, but also as potential early indicators of cognitive impairment, even in relatively healthy older men and women.","Over a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 850 individuals developed dementia and 4352 cognitive decline.

19,37983577,Clinical Risk Factors of Perioperative Pressure Injury in Older Adult Patients with a Hip Fracture.,"To examine the clinical risk factors of perioperative pressure injury (PrI) in older adults with a hip fracture, including preoperative chronic comorbidities and postoperative complications.
In this retrospective study, the authors queried the PearlDiver Patient Records database between January 2011 and January 2020. Data from 54,194 patients without preexisting PrI were included for analyses. Patients were separated into two groups: (1) one or more perioperative PrI and (2) no PrI. Clinical factors as outcome variables include 21 comorbidities and 10 complications.
Univariate analyses were computed to compare the variables between groups, and two logistic regression models were developed to find comorbidity predictors and complication predictors. Of all patients, 1,362 (2.5%) developed one or more perioperative PrI. Patients with perioperative PrIs were more likely to be older men. One-year mortality for patients with perioperative PrI was 2.5 times that of patients without PrI. The regression models showed that predictors of perioperative PrI are malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, frailty, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, urinary tract infection, perioperative red blood cell transfusion, and atrial fibrillation.
Screening for these comorbidities and complications may assist in determining the risk of PrI in older adults undergoing hip fracture surgery.

35873239",Mild Cognitive Impairment among Elderly Persons Residing in an Urban Resettlement Colony in Delhi.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal cognition and clinical dementia. MCI is associated with an increased risk of dementia and mortality. Progression of MCI to dementia can be prevented by cognitive and lifestyle interventions. There is limited evidence on the burden and risk factors associated with MCI in India. To estimate the prevalence of MCI among elderly persons, and to study the factors associated with MCI.
This community-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 365 persons aged 60 years or older, residing in an urban resettlement colony of Delhi. Participants with dementia (score <23 on the Hindi version of the Mini-Mental State Examination) were excluded. Objective cognitive impairment and functional disability were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Impairment-Basic (MoCA-B) tool and Barthel's Activities of Daily Living, respectively. The prevalence of MCI was estimated by Petersen's criteria, i.e., subjective memory impairment, objective cognitive impairment (MoCA score 19-25), functional independence, and absence of dementia. Univariate analysis was performed, followed by stepwise multivariate logistic regression. The association of socio-demographic and other health conditions with MCI was assessed.
The prevalence of MCI was 9.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7-12.7], 13.3% (95% CI 8.8-19.7) among men, and 6.5% (95% CI 3.9-10.6) among women. The risk of MCI was higher among current smokers.
MCI was common among the elderly. Early detection of MCI may be included in health programs for elderly persons.","['Activities of Daily Living (ADL)', 'Montreal Cognitive Impairment-Basic (MoCA-B)', 'dementia', 'elderly', 'mild cognitive impairment (MCI)', 'urban']",Indian journal of community medicine : official publication of Indian Association of Preventive & Social Medicine,2023-11-16,"[{'lastname': 'Achary', 'firstname': 'Mg Thejas', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Ravneet', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Vibha', 'firstname': 'Deepti', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mani', 'firstname': 'Kalaivani', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kant', 'firstname': 'Shashi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Sanjeev Kumar', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}]",,,"The prevalence of MCI was 9.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7-12.7], 13.3% (95% CI 8.8-19.7) among men, and 6.5% (95% CI 3.9-10.6) among women.

21,37956642,Associations between physical inactivity and dementia prevalence: ecological study using global data.,"Given the predicted rise in dementia prevalence around the world, targeting modifiable risk factors (often lifestyle related) is a priority. This work sought to understand the role of physical inactivity (PI) as a modifiable risk factor for dementia.
Ecological study using globally available ecological data (both 2010 and 2016) from 192 countries.
Age-standardised PI prevalence and dementia prevalence data were accessed from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Global Burden of Disease Study. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between PI and dementia, with stratified analyses used to further explore the impact of sex, WHO region, and World Bank income group on the relationship.
Linear regression showed a positive association between inactivity and dementia prevalence in 2010 (b = 1.38 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.04, 2.71] P = 0.044) and 2016 (coefficient = 2.52 [95% CI: 1.07, 3.96] P = 0.0007). Sub-group analyses of sex-specific data showed the strength of the relationship was stronger in men than in women. Rates of both dementia and inactivity rose with increasing world income group.
This analysis of global data indicates the presence of a positive relationship between prevalence of PI and dementia prevalence, which has increased in strength with time, and is stronger in men than in women. This highlights the importance of public health interventions on a global scale to reduce the percentage of the population failing to reach or exceed the recommended physical activity guidelines.","['Dementia', 'Global health', 'Physical inactivity']",Public health,2023-11-14,"[{'lastname': 'Lloyd-Hazlegreaves', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayes', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Pearce', 'firstname': 'M S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, UK.

22,37952420,Dual decline in subjective gait speed and domain-specific cognition is associated with higher risk of incident dementia in older Japanese adults: A 15-year age-specific cohort study.,"Dual decline in gait speed and cognition has been found to have higher dementia risk than no decline or pure decline. However, evidence from the Asian population is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of dual decline from age 65 to 70 years with late-life dementia in older Japanese adults with different personal characteristics.
Data were collected from an age-specific cohort study conducted in 482 Japanese 65-year-old adults. We investigated participant demographics, medical histories, lifestyles, subjective gait speed, and cognition at both 64/65 and 70/71 years old, and confirmed dementia until age of 85 years. Cox proportion hazard models were used to estimate the risk of dementia, with adjustments for covariates, and death was treated as a competing risk.
After a mean follow-up period of 12.5-years, 111 participants developed dementia. Older adults with dual decline are more likely to have hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking habits. And we found that dual decline in gait speed and domain-specific cognition was associated with a higher risk of dementia compared with no decline in most cognitive tests, with the highest risk observed for gait speed combined with memory (sub-distribution hazard ratio:3.89, 95 %, confidence intervals: [1.68-9.01]). However, significant differences only existed in men after stratification by sex.
A dual decline in subjective gait speed and cognition may serve as a robust predictor of dementia over a decade prior to its onset, particularly in men. These findings highlighted the importance of screening for dual decline at an early age.","['Aged', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Gait speed', 'Memory']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2023-11-13,"[{'lastname': 'Hao', 'firstname': 'Wen', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shan', 'firstname': 'Yi-Fan', 'initials': 'YF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan; First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kimura', 'firstname': 'Takashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ukawa', 'firstname': 'Shigekazu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Welfare Science and Clinical Psychology, Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology, Osaka Metropolitan University, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ohira', 'firstname': 'Hideki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Graduate School of Informatics, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okabayashi', 'firstname': 'Satoe', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Agency for Health, Safety and Environment, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wakai', 'firstname': 'Kenji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ando', 'firstname': 'Masahiko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tamakoshi', 'firstname': 'Akiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.

26028642",Long-term occupational exposures on disability-free survival and mortality in older adults.,"The impact of long-term occupational exposures on health in older adults is increasingly relevant as populations age. To date, no studies have reported their impact on survival free of disability in older adults.
We aimed to investigate the association between long-term occupational exposure and disability-free survival (DFS), all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in initially healthy older adults.
We analysed data from 12 215 healthy participants in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study whose mean age was 75 years. Their work history was collated with the 'ALOHA-plus JEM' (Job Exposure Matrix) to assign occupational exposures. The primary endpoint, DFS, was a composite measure of death, dementia or persistent physical disability. The secondary endpoint, mortality, was classified according to the underlying cause. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for confounders.
A total of 1835 individuals reached the DFS endpoint during the median 4.7 years follow-up period. Both ever-high and cumulative exposure to all dusts and all pesticides during a person's working years were associated with reduced DFS. Compared to no exposure, men with high exposure to dusts and pesticides had a reduced DFS. Neither of these exposures were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Men with high occupational exposure to solvents and women exposed to dusts experienced higher all-cause and cancer-related mortality.

28865985",Constricting Life Space and Likelihood of Neurodegenerative Disease in Community-Dwelling Older Men.,"Life space is a measure of the frequency, range, and independence of movement through the environment. There is increasing interest in life space as a holistic measure of function in older adults, but the association between change in life space and incident neurodegenerative disease is unknown.
To evaluate the association between change in life space and cognitive decline or incident neurodegenerative disease over 7 years among community-dwelling older men.
In this cohort study, logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association of baseline and change in life space with change in cognition unadjusted and adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, gait speed, and physical activity. Mixed linear effects models were used to evaluate the association between change in life space and change in cognition. Men were recruited from 6 US sites to participate in a prospective, community-based cohort study of aging and followed-up from 2007 to 2014. Individuals with prevalent dementia or Parkinson disease (PD) at baseline were excluded. Data were analyzed from May 2022 to September 2023.
Life space, assessed using the University of Alabama at Birmingham Life Space Assessment and divided into tertiles.
Participants completed the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Test, and Trail-Making Test Part B at baseline and 7 years later. At follow-up, participants were asked about a new physician diagnosis of dementia and PD.
A total of 1684 men (mean [SD] age, 77.1 [4.2] years) were recruited and over 7 years of follow-up, 80 men (4.8%) developed dementia and 23 men (1.4%) developed PD. Mean (SD) life space score was 92.9 (18.7) points and mean (SD) change was -9.9 (22.3) points over follow up. In the adjusted model, each 1-SD decrement in life space was associated with increased odds of dementia (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.28-1.98) but not PD (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.97-2.25). For each 1-SD decrement in life space, men worsened by 20.6 (95% CI, 19.8-21.1) seconds in their Trails B score (P < .001) and declined by 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0-1.3) points in their 3MS score (P < .001) over 7 years.
In this study of 1684 men followed up over 7 years, change in life space was associated with faster cognitive decline and increased likelihood of neurodegenerative illness. Future studies should examine the role of clinician assessments or wearable electronics in tracking life space in older adults at risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative illness.",[],JAMA network open,2023-11-09,"[{'lastname': 'Bock', 'firstname': 'Meredith A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoang', 'firstname': 'Tina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Cawthon', 'firstname': 'Peggy', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Mackey', 'firstname': 'Dawn C', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Physiology and Kinesiology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.\nCentre for Aging SMART, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Sheena', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Hillier', 'firstname': 'Teresa A', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Portland, Oregon.'}, {'lastname': 'Yaffe', 'firstname': 'Kristine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco.'}]",,,"A total of 1684 men (mean [SD] age, 77.1 [4.2] years) were recruited and over 7 years of follow-up, 80 men (4.8%) developed dementia and 23 men (1.4%) developed PD.

25,37937726,"Subjective memory complaints: Prevalence, associated factors and sex differences in the ELSI-Brazil study.","Subjective memory complaints (SMCs) are a possible prodrome of cognitive decline but are understudied in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SMCs in a large, nationally representative sample of older adults from Brazil and to identify sociodemographic and health-related factors that are associated with SMCs independently of objective memory.
Baseline data (n = 7831) from the ELSI-Brazil study, a national representative sample of adults aged 50 and over. They were asked to rate their memory and then divided into two groups - having or not having SMCs. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of demographic characteristics, health related factors, objective memory performance and disability in basic (b-ADL), instrumental (i-ADL), and advanced (a-ADL) activities of daily living associated with SMCs. Whether sex was an effect modifier of the association between age and objective memory performance and SMCs was also tested.
Of the sample, 42% (95% CI; 39.9-43.9) had SMCs, and it was higher among women (46.9%) than men (35.9%). SMC prevalence decreased with age among women and increased among men, and for both it decreased with better cognitive performance. Fully adjusted logistic regression model showed that older age, higher education, higher b-ADL scores, and better cognitive performance were associated with decreased SMCs, while being female, with higher number of chronic conditions, higher i-ADL scores, worst self-rated health, and an increased number of depressive symptoms were associated with increased SMCs. However, the interaction test (p < 0.001) confirmed that increased age was associated with decreased SMCs only among women, and that better objective memory performance was associated with decreased SMCs only among men.
SMCs are common in the Brazilian older population and are associated with health and sociodemographic factors, with different patterns between men and women. There is a need for future studies looking at the cognitive trajectory and dementia risk in older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.","['aging', 'cognition', 'memory', 'memory perception', 'older adults', 'sex differences', 'subjective memory complaints']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2023-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Pinho', 'firstname': 'Pedro J M R', 'initials': 'PJMR', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Federal de São Paulo.

33747388",Cognitive decline in older adults in the UK during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal analysis of PROTECT study data.,"Although the long-term health effects of COVID-19 are increasingly recognised, the societal restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic hold the potential for considerable detriment to cognitive and mental health, particularly because major dementia risk factors-such as those related to exercise and dietary habits-were affected during this period. We used longitudinal data from the PROTECT study to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on cognition in older adults in the UK.
For this longitudinal analysis, we used computerised neuropsychology data from individuals aged 50 years and older participating in the PROTECT study in the UK. Data were collected from the same participants before the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2019-Feb 29, 2020) and during its first (March 1, 2020-Feb 28, 2021) and second (March 1, 2021-Feb 28, 2022) years. We compared cognition across the three time periods using a linear mixed-effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted in people with mild cognitive impairment and in people who reported a history of COVID-19, and an exploratory regression analysis identified factors associated with changes in cognitive trajectory.
Pre-pandemic data were included for 3142 participants, of whom 1696 (54·0%) were women and 1446 (46·0%) were men, with a mean age of 67·5 years (SD 9·6, range 50-96). Significant worsening of executive function and working memory was observed in the first year of the pandemic across the whole cohort (effect size 0·15 [95% CI 0·12-0·17] for executive function and 0·51 [0·49-0·53] for working memory), in people with mild cognitive impairment (0·13 [0·07-0·20] and 0·40 [0·36-0·47]), and in people with a history of COVID-19 (0·24 [0·16-0·31] and 0·46 [0·39-0·53]). Worsening of working memory was sustained across the whole cohort in the second year of the pandemic (0·47; 0·44-0·49). Regression analysis indicated that cognitive decline was significantly associated with reduced exercise (p=0·0049; executive function) and increased alcohol use (p=0·049; working memory) across the whole cohort, as well as depression (p=0·011; working memory) in those with a history of COVID-19 and loneliness (p=0·0038; working memory) in those with mild cognitive impairment. In the second year of the pandemic, reduced exercise continued to affect executive function across the whole cohort, and associations were sustained between worsening working memory and increased alcohol use (p=0·0040), loneliness (p=0·042), and depression (p=0·014) in those with mild cognitive impairment, and reduced exercise (p=0·0029), loneliness (p=0·031) and depression (p=0·036) in those with a history of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant worsening of cognition in older adults, associated with changes in known dementia risk factors. The sustained decline in cognition highlights the need for public health interventions to mitigate the risk of dementia-particularly in people with mild cognitive impairment, in whom conversion to dementia within 5 years is a substantial risk. Long-term intervention for people with a history of COVID-19 should be considered to support cognitive health.

35876118",Fish and Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Sex and Racial Differences in Cardiovascular Outcomes and Cognitive Function.,"Both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognitive decline are common features of aging. One in 5 deaths is cardiac for both men and women in the United States, and an estimated 50 million are currently living with dementia worldwide. In this review, we summarize sex and racial differences in the role of fish and its very long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in preventing CVD events and cognitive decline. In prospective studies, women with higher nonfried and fatty fish intake and women and Black individuals with higher plasma levels of EPA and DHA had a lower risk of CVD. In randomized controlled trials of EPA and DHA supplementation in primary CVD prevention, Black subjects benefited in a secondary outcome. In secondary CVD prevention, both men and women benefited, and Asians benefited as a prespecified subgroup. Fish and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with prevention of cognitive decline in prospective studies. In randomized controlled trials of EPA and DHA supplementation, women have cognitive benefit. DHA seems more beneficial than EPA, and supplementation is more beneficial when started before cognitive decline. Although studies in women and racial groups are limited, life-long intake of nonfried and fatty fish lowers the risk of CVD and cognitive decline, and randomized controlled trials also show the benefit of EPA and DHA supplementation. These findings should be factored into recommendations for future research and clinical recommendations as dietary modalities could be cost-effective for disease prevention.","['cardiovascular', 'cognition', 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'eicosapentaenoic acid', 'omega-3 fatty acids']","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2023-11-02,"[{'lastname': 'Welty', 'firstname': 'Francine K', 'initials': 'FK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston (F.K.W.).'}, {'lastname': 'Daher', 'firstname': 'Ralph', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Cooper University Healthcare, Camden, NJ (R.D.).'}, {'lastname': 'Garelnabi', 'firstname': 'Mahdi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical and Nutritional Sciences, U Mass Lowell Center for Population Health, University of Massachusetts (M.G.).'}]",,,,,"10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.318125

29,37909125,Developing a predictive model for mortality in patients with cognitive impairment.,"We developed a predictive model for all-cause mortality and examined the risk factors for cause-specific mortality among people with cognitive impairment in a Japanese memory clinic-based cohort (2010-2018).
This retrospective cohort study included people aged ≥65 years with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The survival status was assessed based on the response of participants or their close relatives via a postal survey. Potential predictors including demographic and lifestyle-related factors, functional status, and behavioral and psychological status were assessed at the first visit at the memory clinic. A backward stepwise Cox regression model was used to select predictors, and a predictive model was developed using a regression coefficient-based scoring approach. The discrimination and calibration were assessed via Harrell's C-statistic and a calibration plot, respectively.
A total of 2610 patients aged ≥65 years (men, 38.3%) were analyzed. Over a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, 544 patients (20.8%) died. Nine predictors were selected from the sociodemographic and clinical variables: age, sex, body mass index, gait performance, physical activity, and ability for instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive function, and self-reported comorbidities (pulmonary disease and diabetes). The model showed good discrimination and calibration for 1-5-year mortality (Harrell's C-statistic, 0.739-0.779). Some predictors were specifically associated with cause-specific mortality.
This predictive model has good discriminative ability for 1- to 5-year mortality and can be easily implemented for people with mild cognitive impairment and all stages of dementia referred to a memory clinic.","['death', 'dementia', 'memory clinic', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'older adults', 'predictive model', 'prognosis']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2023-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sugimoto', 'firstname': 'Taiki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention and Care Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.\nCenter for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sakurai', 'firstname': 'Takashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention and Care Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.\nCenter for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.\nResearch Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.\nDepartment of Cognition and Behavior Science, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Noguchi', 'firstname': 'Taiji', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center for Gerontology and Social Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Komatsu', 'firstname': 'Ayane', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Gerontology and Social Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakagawa', 'firstname': 'Takeshi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center for Gerontology and Social Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ueda', 'firstname': 'Ikue', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Osawa', 'firstname': 'Aiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Sangyoon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Gerontology and Social Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shimada', 'firstname': 'Hiroyuki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Center for Gerontology and Social Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuroda', 'firstname': 'Yujiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention and Care Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujita', 'firstname': 'Kosuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention and Care Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsumoto', 'firstname': 'Nanae', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention and Care Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Uchida', 'firstname': 'Kazuaki', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention and Care Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Science, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kishino', 'firstname': 'Yoshinobu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prevention and Care Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.\nDepartment of Cognition and Behavior Science, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ono', 'firstname': 'Rei', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Activity Research, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Tokyo, Japan.\nDepartment of Public Health, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Arai', 'firstname': 'Hidenori', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saito', 'firstname': 'Tami', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center for Gerontology and Social Science, Research Institute, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}]",,,"A total of 2610 patients aged ≥65 years (men, 38.3%) were analyzed.

36481168",The Effect of Cataract Surgery on the Risk of Dementia: A Nationwide Cohort Study.,"An advanced age and the female sex are widely recognized risk factors for both cataract and dementia. We investigated the effect of cataract surgery on the incidence of dementia in a Korean population aged ≥ 45 years with a previous diagnosis of cataract.
This nationwide cohort study was performed using Korean National Health Insurance Service data collected from 2006 to 2017. A total of 300,327 subjects aged ≥ 45 years with a history of cataract diagnosis but no previous diagnosis of dementia were analyzed. The relationship between cataract surgery and dementia was evaluated, applying a time-varying analysis to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values according to dementia. It was calculated via a multivariable Cox regression model, with adjustments for age, sex, visual acuity (VA), ocular and systemic comorbidities, and social factors (including body mass index, income, smoking, and drinking).
In the multivariate analysis, the cataract surgery group showed a marginal difference in dementia development (HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02-1.19]) because both cataract and dementia share common risk factors. However, in the subgroup analysis, men (HR 0.49 [95% CI 0.26-0.90]) and patients under 65 years of age (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) in the group with cataract surgery and good VA showed a significantly lower incidence of dementia.
Through visual improvement, together with timely surgical intervention, the procedure can alleviate the risk of dementia in visually impaired patients, especially in younger and male patients.","['cataract', 'cataract surgery', 'dementia']",Journal of clinical medicine,2023-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Chaeyeon', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Eunhae', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Seoul Nunevit Eye Clinic, Seoul 05551, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Mina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Data Science, Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul 05545, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Bae', 'firstname': 'Yoonjong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Data Science, Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul 05545, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Tae-Young', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Republic of Korea.\nRenew Seoul Eye Center, Seoul 06615, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Seo', 'firstname': 'Sang Won', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': ""Alzheimer's Disease Convergence Research Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul 06351, Republic of Korea.\nDepartment of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Republic of Korea.\nDepartment of Digital Health, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06355, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Jang', 'firstname': 'Hyemin', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Dong Hui', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Republic of Korea.\nSamsung Advanced Institute for Health Science & Technology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Republic of Korea.'}]",,"Through visual improvement, together with timely surgical intervention, the procedure can alleviate the risk of dementia in visually impaired patients, especially in younger and male patients.","In the multivariate analysis, the cataract surgery group showed a marginal difference in dementia development (HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02-1.19]) because both cataract and dementia share common risk factors.

33687462",An investigation of psychoactive polypharmacy and related gender-differences in older adults with dementia: a retrospective cohort study.,"Older adults living with dementia may express challenging responsive behaviours. One management strategy is pharmacologic treatment though these options often have limited benefit, which may lead to multiple treatments being prescribed.
The aim of the present study was to describe psychoactive medication polypharmacy and explore factors associated with psychoactive polypharmacy in a cohort of older adults living with dementia in Nova Scotia, Canada, including a gender-stratified analysis. This was a retrospective cohort study of those aged 65 years or older with a recorded diagnosis of dementia between 2005 and 2015. Medication dispensation data was collected from April 1, 2010, or dementia diagnosis (cohort entry) to either death or March 31, 2015 (cohort exit). Psychoactive medication claims were captured. Psychoactive medication polypharmacy was defined as presence of three or more psychoactive prescription medications dispensed to one subject and overlapping for more than 30 days. Psychoactive polypharmacy episodes were described in duration, quantity, and implicated medications. Regression analysis examined factors associated with experience and frequency of psychoactive polypharmacy. All analysis were stratified by gender.
The cohort included 15,819 adults living with dementia (mean age 80.7 years; 70.0% female), with 99.4% (n = 15,728) receiving at least one psychoactive medication over the period of follow-up. Psychoactive polypharmacy was present in 19.3% of the cohort. The gender specific logistic regressions demonstrated that for both men and women a younger age was associated with an increased risk of psychoactive polypharmacy (women: OR 0.97, 95%CI[0.96, 0.98], men: OR 0.96, 95%CI[0.95, 0.97]). Men were less likely to experience psychoactive polypharmacy if their location of residence was urban (OR 0.86, 95%CI[0.74, 0.99]). There was no significant association between location of residence (urban or rural) and psychoactive polypharmacy for women living with dementia. Antidepressants were the most dispensed medication class, while quetiapine was the most dispensed medication.
This study suggests that of adults living with dementia those of younger ages were more likely to experience psychoactive polypharmacy and that men living with dementia in rural locations may benefit from increased access to non-pharmacological options for dementia management.","['CNS-active medication', 'Dementia', 'Geriatrics', 'Polypharmacy', 'Psychoactive medication']",BMC geriatrics,2023-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Trenaman', 'firstname': 'Shanna C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health, Dalhousie University, 5968 College Street, PO Box 15000, B3H 4R2, Halifax, NS, Canada. shanna.trenaman@dal.ca.\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada. shanna.trenaman@dal.ca.'}, {'lastname': 'Quach', 'firstname': 'Jack', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bowles', 'firstname': 'Susan K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health, Dalhousie University, 5968 College Street, PO Box 15000, B3H 4R2, Halifax, NS, Canada.\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.\nNova Scotia Health, Halifax, NS, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirkland', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.\nDepartment of Community Health and Epidemiology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrew', 'firstname': 'Melissa K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.\nNova Scotia Health, Halifax, NS, Canada.\nDepartment of Community Health and Epidemiology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.'}]",,,"The cohort included 15,819 adults living with dementia (mean age 80.7 years; 70.0% female), with 99.4% (n = 15,728) receiving at least one psychoactive medication over the period of follow-up.

33,37839560,Risk of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Persons with Glaucoma: A National Cohort Study.,"Glaucoma is a heterogeneous group of optic neuropathies that potentially may be associated with other cerebral neurodegenerative processes leading to dementia. However, prior studies have been inconsistent. We examined dementia risks after glaucoma diagnosis in a large population-based cohort.
National matched cohort study.
A total of 324 730 persons diagnosed with glaucoma during 1995-2017 in Sweden and 3 247 300 age- and sex-matched population-based controls without prior dementia.
Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and all-cause dementia in persons with glaucoma compared with controls, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.
Alzheimer's disease, VaD, and all-cause dementia identified from nationwide inpatient and outpatient diagnoses through 2018.
In 16 million person-years of follow-up, 32 339 persons (10%) with glaucoma and 226 896 controls (7%) were diagnosed with dementia. Persons with glaucoma had increased risks for AD (adjusted HR, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.43), VaD (1.66; 1.61-1.72), and all-cause dementia (1.57; 1.54-1.59). Among glaucoma subtypes, both primary open-angle and normal-tension glaucoma were associated with increased risk for AD (adjusted HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.27-1.36; and 1.28; 1.20-1.36, respectively) and VaD (1.61; 1.54-1.68; and 1.39; 1.28-1.50, respectively), whereas primary angle-closure glaucoma was associated with VaD (1.26; 1.02-1.56) but not AD (0.98; 0.82-1.18). These findings were similar in men and women. All risks were highest in persons diagnosed with glaucoma at ages ≥ 70 years and were not elevated for ages < 60 years.
In this large national cohort, persons with glaucoma had increased risks for AD, VaD, and all-cause dementia, particularly those diagnosed with glaucoma at older ages. Persons with glaucoma may need increased monitoring for dementia to facilitate earlier detection and treatment.

28988512",Associations Between Head Injury and Subsequent Risk of Falls: Results From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.,"Falls are a leading cause of head injury among older adults, but the risk of fall occurring after a head injury is less well-characterized. We sought to examine the association between head injury and subsequent risk of falls requiring hospital care among community-dwelling older adults.
This analysis included 13,081 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study enrolled in 1987-1989 and followed through 2019. The association of head injury (time-varying exposure, self-reported and/or ICD-9/10 code identified) with the risk of subsequent (occurring >1-month after head injury) falls requiring hospital care (ICD-9/10 code defined) was modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Secondary analyses included Fine and Gray proportional hazards regression to account for the competing risk of death, analysis of head injury frequency and severity, and formal testing for interaction by age, sex, and race. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/center, education, military service, alcohol consumption, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and psychotropic medication use.
The mean age of participants at baseline was 54 years, 58% were female, 28% were Black, and 14% had at least one head injury occurring over the study period. Over a median 23 years of follow-up, 29% of participants had a fall requiring medical care. In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, individuals with head injury had 2.01 (95% CI 1.85-2.18) times the risk of falls compared with individuals without head injury. Accounting for the competing risk of mortality, individuals with head injury had 1.69 (95% CI 1.57-1.82) times the risk of falls compared with individuals without head injury. We observed stronger associations among men compared with women (men: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.60, 95% CI 2.25-3.00; women: HR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.63-1.99, 
Among community-dwelling older adults followed over 30 years, head injury was associated with subsequent falls requiring medical care. We observed stronger associations among men and with increasing number and severity of head injuries. Whether older individuals with head injury might benefit from fall prevention measures should be a focus of future research.",[],Neurology,2023-10-11,"[{'lastname': 'Hunzinger', 'firstname': 'Katherine J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'From the Department of Exercise Science (K.J.H.), Thomas Jefferson University;

15010086",Cerebrovascular Reactivity in Patients With Small Vessel Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is inversely related to white matter hyperintensity severity, a marker of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Less is known about the relationship between CVR and other SVD imaging features or cognition. We aimed to investigate these cross-sectional relationships.
Between 2018 and 2021 in Edinburgh, we recruited patients presenting with lacunar or cortical ischemic stroke, whom we characterized for SVD features. We measured CVR in subcortical gray matter, normal-appearing white matter, and white matter hyperintensity using 3T magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed cognition using Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Statistical analyses included linear regression models with CVR as outcome, adjusted for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. We reported regression coefficients with 95% CIs.
Of 208 patients, 182 had processable CVR data sets (median age, 68.2 years; 68% men). Although the strength of association depended on tissue type, lower CVR in normal-appearing tissues and white matter hyperintensity was associated with larger white matter hyperintensity volume (B
Lower CVR in patients with SVD was related to more severe SVD burden and worse cognition in this cross-sectional analysis. Longitudinal analysis will help determine whether lower CVR predicts worsening SVD severity or vice versa.

373811",Underlying Causes of TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke and Risk of Major Vascular Events.,"The coexistence of underlying causes in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke as well as their associated 5-year risks are not well known.
To apply the ASCOD (atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, cardiac pathology, other cause, or dissection) grading system to assess coexistence of underlying causes of TIA and minor ischemic stroke and the 5-year risk for major vascular events.
This international registry cohort (TIAregistry.org) study enrolled 4789 patients from June 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, with 1- to 5-year follow-up at 61 sites in 21 countries. Eligible patients had a TIA or minor stroke (with modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1) within the last 7 days. Among these, 3847 patients completed the 5-year follow-up by December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2022, to June 15, 2023.
Five-year follow-up.
Estimated 5-year risk of the composite outcome of stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or cardiovascular death.
A total of 3847 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [13.2] years; 2295 men [59.7%]) in 42 sites were enrolled and participated in the 5-year follow-up cohort (median percentage of 5-year follow-up per center was 92.3% [IQR, 83.4%-97.8%]). In 998 patients with probable or possible causal atherosclerotic disease, 489 (49.0%) had some form of small vessel disease (SVD), including 110 (11.0%) in whom a lacunar stroke was also probably or possibly causal, and 504 (50.5%) had no SVD; 275 (27.6%) had some cardiac findings, including 225 (22.6%) in whom cardiac pathology was also probably or possibly causal, and 702 (70.3%) had no cardiac findings. Compared with patients with none of the 5 ASCOD categories of disease (n = 484), the 5-year rate of major vascular events was almost 5 times higher (hazard ratio [HR], 4.86 [95% CI, 3.07-7.72]; P < .001) in patients with causal atherosclerosis, 2.5 times higher (HR, 2.57 [95% CI, 1.58-4.20]; P < .001) in patients with causal lacunar stroke or lacunar syndrome, and 4 times higher (HR, 4.01 [95% CI, 2.50-6.44]; P < .001) in patients with causal cardiac pathology.
The findings of this cohort study suggest that in patients with TIA and minor ischemic stroke, the coexistence of atherosclerosis, SVD, cardiac pathology, dissection, or other causes is substantial, and the 5-year risk of a major vascular event varies considerably across the 5 categories of underlying diseases. These findings further suggest the need for secondary prevention strategies based on pathophysiology rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",[],JAMA neurology,2023-10-02,"[{'lastname': 'Lavallée', 'firstname': 'Philippa C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Bichat Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) Laboratory for Vascular Translational Science (LVTS)-U1148, University Paris-Cité, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Charles', 'firstname': 'Hugo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Bichat Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) Laboratory for Vascular Translational Science (LVTS)-U1148, University Paris-Cité, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Albers', 'firstname': 'Gregory W', 'initials': 'GW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford Stroke Center, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Caplan', 'firstname': 'Louis R', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': 'Cerebrovascular Disease Service, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Donnan', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey A', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Melbourne Brain Centre, Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferro', 'firstname': 'José M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular João Lobo Antunes, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Hennerici', 'firstname': 'Michael G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Universitäts Medizin Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Labreuche', 'firstname': 'Julien', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Bichat Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) Laboratory for Vascular Translational Science (LVTS)-U1148, University Paris-Cité, Paris, France.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Lille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Molina', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Stroke Unit, Department of Neurology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Rothwell', 'firstname': 'Peter M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Steg', 'firstname': 'Philippe Gabriel', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Hôpital Bichat, Université Paris Cité, AP-HP, INSERM LVTS-U1148, Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Touboul', 'firstname': 'Pierre-Jean', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Bichat Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) Laboratory for Vascular Translational Science (LVTS)-U1148, University Paris-Cité, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Uchiyama', 'firstname': 'Shinichiro', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Brain and Cerebral Vessels, Sanno Hospital and Sanno Medical Center, International University of Health and Welfare, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Vicaut', 'firstname': 'Éric', 'initials': 'É', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Université Paris-Cité, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Lawrence K S', 'initials': 'LKS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine & Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Amarenco', 'firstname': 'Pierre', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Bichat Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) Laboratory for Vascular Translational Science (LVTS)-U1148, University Paris-Cité, Paris, France.\nPopulation Health Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,"A total of 3847 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [13.2] years; 2295 men [59.7%]) in 42 sites were enrolled and participated in the 5-year follow-up cohort (median percentage of 5-year follow-up per center was 92.3% [IQR, 83.4%-97.8%]).

37,37781798,Impact of Mood Disorder History and Bone Health on Cognitive Function Among Men Without Dementia.,"Poor cognitive function, a major disabling condition of older age, is often considered a prodromal feature of dementia. High mortality and the lack of a cure for dementia have necessitated a focus on the identification of potentially modifiable risk factors. Mental and physical health conditions such as mood disorders and bone loss have been previously linked with poor cognition individually although their combined effect remains largely unknown.
Considering the multifactorial nature of dementia pathology, we investigated whether mood disorders, bone health and their interaction are associated with cognitive function in a population-based sample of men.
Four hundred and forty-two male participants were drawn from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Cognitive function was assessed using the CogState Brief Battery, which measured cognitive performance across four domains and was used to compute overall cognitive function. Mood disorders and hip bone mineral density (BMD) were determined using a semi-structured clinical interview and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively.
Hip BMD (Bcoeff = 0.56, 95% CI: [0.07, 1.05], p = 0.025) but not mood disorder (Bcoeff = -0.50, 95% CI: [-0.20, 0.10], p = 0.529) was associated with overall cognitive function after accounting for potential confounders. Interaction effects were observed between the two exposures (Bcoeff = -1.37, 95% CI: [-2.49, -0.26], p = 0.016) suggesting that individuals without a mood disorder displayed better cognitive performance with increasing BMD, while those with a lifetime history of mood disorder displayed poorer cognitive function with increasing BMD.
These findings highlight the importance of exploring interactions among potentially modifiable health conditions associated with cognitive function.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'bone mineral density', 'cognitive function', 'interaction', 'mood disorder']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-10-02,"[{'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Kanika', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.\nBaker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohebbi', 'firstname': 'Mohammadreza', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.\nBiostatistics Unit, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, Burwood, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasco', 'firstname': 'Julie A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.\nDepartment of Medicine-Western Health, The University of Melbourne, St Albans, VIC, Australia.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Prahran, VIC, Australia.\nBarwon Health, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Lana J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.\nBarwon Health, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Walder', 'firstname': 'Ken', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ng', 'firstname': 'Boon Lung', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barwon Health, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Veer Bala', 'initials': 'VB', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}]",,,"Hip BMD (Bcoeff = 0.56, 95% CI: [0.07, 1.05], p = 0.025) but not mood disorder (Bcoeff = -0.50, 95% CI: [-0.20, 0.10], p = 0.529) was associated with overall cognitive function after accounting for potential confounders.

24136970","Stress, depression, and risk of dementia - a cohort study in the total population between 18 and 65 years old in Region Stockholm.","Chronic stress and depression are potential risk factors for mild cognitive impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer disease. The aim was to investigate whether any such risk is additive.
Cohort study including 1 362 548 people (665 997 women, 696 551 men) with records in the Region Stockholm administrative healthcare database (VAL). Exposure was a recorded ICD-10 diagnosis of chronic stress, depression, or both, recorded in 2012 or 2013. Outcome was a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, other dementia, or mild cognitive impairment recorded from 2014 through 2022. Odds ratios with 99% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, sex, neighborhood socioeconomic status, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders were calculated.
During the exposure period, 4 346 patients were diagnosed with chronic stress, 40 101 with depression, and 1 898 with both. The average age at baseline was around 40 years in all groups. In the fully adjusted model, the odds ratio of Alzheimer disease was 2.45 (99% CI 1.22-4.91) in patients with chronic stress, 2.32 (99% CI 1.85-2.90) in patients with depression, and 4.00 (99% CI 1.67-9.58) in patients with chronic stress and depression. The odds ratio of mild cognitive impairment was 1.87 (99% CI 1.20-2.91) in patients with chronic stress, 2.85 (99% CI 2.53-3.22) in patients with depression, and 3.87 (99% CI 2.39-6.27) in patients with both. When other dementia was analyzed, the odds ratio was significant only in patients with depression, 2.39 (99% CI 1.92-2.96).
Documented chronic stress increased the risk of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. The same was seen with depression. The novel finding is the potential additive effect of chronic stress to depression, on risk of MCI and AD.","['Administrative databases', 'Alzheimer', 'Dementia', 'Depression', 'General population', 'Mental illness', 'Neurodegenerative disorders', 'Psychiatric disorders', 'Stress', 'Stress-related disorder']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2023-10-02,"[{'lastname': 'Wallensten', 'firstname': 'Johanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital, 18288, Stockholm, Sweden. johanna.wallensten@ki.se.\nAcademic Primary Health Care Centre, Solnavägen 1E, 104 31, Stockholm, Sweden. johanna.wallensten@ki.se.'}, {'lastname': 'Ljunggren', 'firstname': 'Gunnar', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Academic Primary Health Care Centre, Solnavägen 1E, 104 31, Stockholm, Sweden.\nDivision of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Nager', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Wachtler', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Academic Primary Health Care Centre, Solnavägen 1E, 104 31, Stockholm, Sweden.\nDivision of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Bogdanovic', 'firstname': 'Nenad', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrovic', 'firstname': 'Predrag', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nCenter for Cognitive and Computational Neurosceince (CCNP), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlsson', 'firstname': 'Axel C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Academic Primary Health Care Centre, Solnavägen 1E, 104 31, Stockholm, Sweden.\nDivision of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.'}]",,,"During the exposure period, 4 346 patients were diagnosed with chronic stress, 40 101 with depression, and 1 898 with both.

39,37776983,Predicting Instability Risk Following Hemiarthroplasty for Femoral Neck Hip Fractures in Geriatric Patients.,"Although a rare complication, dislocation following hemiarthroplasty (HA) for a femoral neck hip fracture is associated with increased mortality, readmission, and possible revision surgery. To date many of the specific risk factors have been difficult to demonstrate. Patient factors, surgical factors, as well as morphological factors need to be assessed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the risk factors for dislocation of HA following femoral neck hip fractures in the geriatric population.
This was a retrospective review of 270 patients who had hip fractures. Medical records between the years 2016 and 2022 informed binomial regression predictive models. The discriminative ability of variables in the final model and acetabular anteversion to predict dislocation was assessed with area under the curve (AUC) estimates.

40,37716256,Association of insomnia with incident chronic cognitive impairment in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A prospective study of the Hong Kong Diabetes Register.,"To examine the risk association of insomnia with incident chronic cognitive impairment in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).
Between July 2010 and June 2015, patients with T2D aged ≥60 years enrolled in the Hong Kong Diabetes Register completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire. Patients were considered having insomnia if they had ISI score > 14. We prospectively followed up the cohort and censored outcome through reviewing diagnoses and clinical notes entered by attending physicians in electronic medical record to identify incident cases of mild cognitive impairment and dementia.
After excluding shift workers and those with established chronic cognitive impairment at baseline, we included 986 patients with T2D in this study (58.3 % men, mean age ± standard deviation: 62.5 ± 2.6 years, disease duration of diabetes: 10.7 ± 8.2 years, HbA1c: 7.4 ± 1.3 %, insulin users: 28.7 %, insomnia: 9.1 %). After a median follow-up of 7.6 (interquartile range = 2.0) years, 41 (4.2 %) developed chronic cognitive impairment. Using Cox regression analysis, insomnia (hazard ratio, HR 2.909, p = 0.012) and HbA1c ≥ 7 % (HR 2.300, p = 0.038) were positively associated with incident chronic cognitive impairment while insulin use (HR 0.309, p = 0.028) showed negative association.
Insomnia, suboptimal glycemic control and non-insulin use are independent risk factors for incident chronic cognitive impairment in older adults with T2D.","['Cognitive impairment', 'Insomnia', 'Older adults', 'Type 2 diabetes']",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2023-09-17,"[{'lastname': 'O', 'firstname': 'Chun-Kwan', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.

20010207",Life expectancy associated with different ages at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in high-income countries: 23 million person-years of observation.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly, particularly among younger age groups. Estimates suggest that people with diabetes die, on average, 6 years earlier than people without diabetes. We aimed to provide reliable estimates of the associations between age at diagnosis of diabetes and all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and reductions in life expectancy.
For this observational study, we conducted a combined analysis of individual-participant data from 19 high-income countries using two large-scale data sources: the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (96 cohorts, median baseline years 1961-2007, median latest follow-up years 1980-2013) and the UK Biobank (median baseline year 2006, median latest follow-up year 2020). We calculated age-adjusted and sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality according to age at diagnosis of diabetes using data from 1 515 718 participants, in whom deaths were recorded during 23·1 million person-years of follow-up. We estimated cumulative survival by applying age-specific HRs to age-specific death rates from 2015 for the USA and the EU.
For participants with diabetes, we observed a linear dose-response association between earlier age at diagnosis and higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with participants without diabetes. HRs were 2·69 (95% CI 2·43-2·97) when diagnosed at 30-39 years, 2·26 (2·08-2·45) at 40-49 years, 1·84 (1·72-1·97) at 50-59 years, 1·57 (1·47-1·67) at 60-69 years, and 1·39 (1·29-1·51) at 70 years and older. HRs per decade of earlier diagnosis were similar for men and women. Using death rates from the USA, a 50-year-old individual with diabetes died on average 14 years earlier when diagnosed aged 30 years, 10 years earlier when diagnosed aged 40 years, or 6 years earlier when diagnosed aged 50 years than an individual without diabetes. Using EU death rates, the corresponding estimates were 13, 9, or 5 years earlier.
Every decade of earlier diagnosis of diabetes was associated with about 3-4 years of lower life expectancy, highlighting the need to develop and implement interventions that prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and to intensify the treatment of risk factors among young adults diagnosed with diabetes.

12886171",A scoping review of risk factors for urinary incontinence in older men.,"Most epidemiological studies have not systematically identified or categorized risk factors for urinary incontinence (UI) in older men, despite a higher prevalence than in younger men. Considering the burden of UI, an understanding of risk factors can inform cost-effective prevention/treatment programs. This scoping review aimed to identify and categorise risk factors for UI in older men, identify gaps in the evidence, and opportunities for future research.
The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) method for scoping reviews guided the conduct and reporting of this review alongside the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews checklist. JBI's Population, Concept, and Context approach framed the inclusion criteria (all evidence sources on UI risk factors that included older men [65 +]). We employed JBI's three-step search strategy, which included a limited initial search in Ovid MEDLINE, a detailed comprehensive database search, and a search of reference lists of included studies, Google Scholar and grey literature. There were no restrictions on language, study type, or publication date. Two independent reviewers screened, selected, and extracted eligible studies. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.
Forty-seven articles that met the inclusion criteria identified 98 risk factors across six categories. Behavioural risk factors, reported by only two studies, were the least investigated of all the categories, whereas medical factors/diseases were the most investigated. No genetic factors were documented. The top five risk factors were increasing age/advanced age (n = 12), Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (n = 11), Diabetes Mellitus (n = 11), Detrusor overactivity (n = 10), limitation in physical function/ADL disability (n = 10), increased Body Mass Index (BMI)/overweight/obesity (n = 8), Dementia (n = 8), and Parkinson's disease (n = 7).
There is a dearth of evidence to describe the role behavioural risk factors have in UI in older men. These factors may play a role in health promotion and disease prevention in this area.

Yet, longitudinal studies examining the interplay between atherosclerosis and its risk factors on brain health in midlife are scarce. We aimed to characterise the longitudinal associations between cerebral glucose metabolism, subclinical atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged asymptomatic individuals.

16391478",A plasma protein signature associated with cognitive function in men without severe cognitive impairment.,"A minimally invasive blood-based assessment of cognitive function could be a promising screening strategy to identify high-risk groups for the incidence of Alzheimer's disease.
The study included 448 cognitively unimpaired men (mean age 64.1 years) drawn from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. A targeted mass spectrometry-based proteomic assay was performed to measure the abundance levels of 269 plasma proteins followed by linear regression analyses adjusted for age and APOE ε4 carrier status to identify the biomarkers related to overall cognitive function. Furthermore, two-way interactions were conducted to see whether Alzheimer's disease-linked genetic variants or health conditions modify the association between biomarkers and cognitive function.
Ten plasma proteins showed an association with overall cognitive function. This association was modified by allelic variants in genes ABCA7, CLU, BDNF and MS4A6A that have been previously linked to Alzheimer's disease. Modifiable health conditions such as mood disorders and poor bone health, which are postulated to be risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, also impacted the relationship observed between protein marker levels and cognition. In addition to the univariate analyses, an 11-feature multianalyte model was created using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression that identified 10 protein features and age associated with cognitive function.
Overall, the present study revealed plasma protein candidates that may contribute to the development of a blood-based screening test for identifying early cognitive changes. This study also highlights the importance of considering other risk factors in elucidating the relationship between biomarkers and cognition, an area that remains largely unexplored.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Cognitive function', 'Genotyping', 'Proteomic analysis', 'Risk factors']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2023-09-02,"[{'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Kanika', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, 3216, Australia.\nBaker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohebbi', 'firstname': 'Mohammadreza', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, 3216, Australia.\nBiostatistics Unit, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, Burwood, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasco', 'firstname': 'Julie A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, 3216, Australia.\nDepartment of Medicine-Western Health, The University of Melbourne, St Albans, VIC, Australia.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Prahran, VIC, Australia.\nBarwon Health, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Lana J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, 3216, Australia.\nBarwon Health, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sui', 'firstname': 'Sophia X', 'initials': 'SX', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, 3216, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Walder', 'firstname': 'Ken', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, 3216, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ng', 'firstname': 'Boon Lung', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barwon Health, Geelong, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Veer Bala', 'initials': 'VB', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, IMPACT - The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, 3216, Australia. veer.gupta@deakin.edu.au.'}]",,,"Ten plasma proteins showed an association with overall cognitive function.

14713698",Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias in US Native Americans: A major public health concern.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's related dementias (ADRD) are growing public health concerns in aged populations of all ethnic and racial groups. AD and ADRD are caused by multiple factors, such as genetic mutations, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, and lifestyle. Studies of postmortem brains have revealed multiple cellular changes implicated in AD and ADRD, including the accumulation of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau, synaptic damage, inflammatory responses, hormonal imbalance, mitochondrial abnormalities, and neuronal loss. These changes occur in both early-onset familial and late-onset sporadic forms. Two-thirds of women and one-third of men are at life time risk for AD. A small proportion of total AD cases are caused by genetic mutations in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 1 genes, and the APOE4 allele is a risk factor. Tremendous research on AD/ADRD, and other comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cancer has been done on almost all ethnic groups, however, very little biomedical research done on US Native Americans. AD/ADRD prevalence is high among all ethnic groups. In addition, US Native Americans have poorer access to healthcare and medical services and are less likely to receive a diagnosis once they begin to exhibit symptoms, which presents difficulties in treating Alzheimer's and other dementias. One in five US Native American people who are 45 years of age or older report having memory issues. Further, the impact of caregivers and other healthcare aspects on US Native Americans is not yet. In the current article, we discuss the history of Native Americans of United States (US) and health disparities, occurrence, and prevalence of AD/ADRD, and shedding light on the culturally sensitive caregiving practices in US Native Americans. This article is the first to discuss biomedical research and healthcare disparities in US Native Americans with a focus on AD and ADRD, we also discuss why US Native Americans are reluctant to participate in biomedical research.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'American Indians', 'Amyloid beta', 'Dementia', 'Native Americans', 'Phosphorylated tau']",Ageing research reviews,2023-08-07,"[{'lastname': 'Sehar', 'firstname': 'Ujala', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kopel', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Reddy', 'firstname': 'P Hemachandra', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA; Nutritional Sciences Department, College of Human Sciences, Texas Tech University, 1301 Akron Ave, Lubbock, TX 79409, USA; Neurology, Departments of School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA; Public Health Department of Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA; Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, School Health Professions, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA; Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.

31485707",Glycemic variability correlates with medial temporal lobe atrophy and decreased cognitive performance in patients with memory deficits.,"In the past, researchers have observed a significant link between glycemia and dementia. Medial temporal atrophy (MTA) is regarded as a common marker of dementia. The correlation between glycemic variability and MTA is unclear, and it has not been determined whether glycemic variability can be utilized as a biomarker of MTA and cognitive performance.
The patients in a memory clinic who underwent brain MRI scans and cognitive assessments within the first week of their hospital visit, were enrolled. All participants underwent three fasting blood glucose and one HBA1c assessments on three self-selected days within 1 week of their first visit. The variability independent of the mean (VIM) was employed. Validated visual scales were used to rate the MTA results. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scales were employed to assess the cognitive functions of the participants. Spearman's correlation and regression models were used to examine the relationship between the MMSE and MoCA scales, and also determine the link between the MRI characteristics and cognitive status, where vascular risk factors, educational status, age, gender, and mean glucose parameters served as covariates.
Four hundred sixty-one subjects completed the MMSE scale, while 447 participants completed the MoCA scale. Data analysis revealed that 47.72% of the participants were men (220/461), and the median age of the patients was 69.87 ± 5.37 years. The findings of Spearman's correlation analysis exhibited a strong negative relationship between the VIM and MMSE score (
The variability in the blood glucose levels, which was presented as VIM, was related to the reduced cognitive function, which was reflected by MMSE and MoCA scales. The relationship between the VIM and the MTA score was non-linear.

36551114",Role of Anemia in Dementia Risk Among Veterans With Incident CKD.,"Although some evidence exists of increased dementia risk from anemia, it is unclear whether this association persists among adults with CKD. Anemia may be a key marker for dementia among adults with CKD, so we evaluated whether anemia is associated with an increased risk of dementia among adults with CKD.
Retrospective cohort study.
The study included 620,095 veterans aged≥45 years with incident stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]<60mL/min/1.73m
Anemia was assessed based on the average of hemoglobin levels (g/L) during the 2 years before the date of incident CKD and categorized as normal, mild, or moderate/severe anemia (≥12.0, 11.0-11.9,<11.0g/dL, respectively, for women, and≥13.0, 11.0-12.9,<11.0g/dL for men).
Dementia and the composite outcome of kidney failure or death.
Adjusted cause-specific hazard ratios were estimated for each outcome.
At the time of incident CKD, the mean age of the participants was 72 years, 97% were male, and their mean eGFR was 51mL/min per 1.73m
Residual confounding from the observational study design. Findings may not be generalizable to the broader US population.
Anemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia among veterans with incident CKD, underscoring the role of anemia as a predictor of dementia risk.
Adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often have anemia. Prior studies among adults in the general population suggest anemia is a risk factor for dementia, though it is unclear whether this association persists among adults with CKD. In this large study of veterans in the United States, we studied the association between anemia and the risk of 2 important outcomes in this population: (1) dementia and (2) kidney failure or death. We found that anemia was associated with a greater risk of dementia as well as risk of kidney failure or death. The study findings therefore emphasize the role of anemia as a key predictor of dementia risk among adults with CKD.","['Anemia', 'ESKD', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dementia', 'kidney failure']",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2023-07-30,"[{'lastname': 'Koyama', 'firstname': 'Alain K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

49,37515589,Association of Thyroid Hormone Medication Adherence With Risk of Dementia.,"Recent studies suggest that hypothyroidism is a risk factor for dementia. Based on existing literature, it is unclear if treatment or compliance to treatment is associated with decreased dementia risk in hypothyroidism patients.
To determine the association between thyroid hormone medication adherence and risk of dementia.
A population-based cohort study following patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism until incidence of dementia, death, or December 31, 2020, whichever came earliest. The study comprised 41 554 older adults age 50 and above with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism between 2004 and 2008 who underwent health screening. Risk of dementia was evaluated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression.
Among 5188 men (12.5%) and 36 366 (87.5%) women, 2120 cases of incident dementia were identified. After stratification of the participants according to the interquartile range of the medication possession ratio (MPR), the fourth quartile (highest adherence) showed a 14% lower risk of overall dementia compared with the first quartile (lowest adherence) (adjusted hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.76-0.97). No consistent association was observed between thyroid hormone medication adherence and vascular dementia. After a dichotomous stratification of the MPR, higher MPR (≥0.8) showed a lower risk of Alzheimer disease (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-0.99) than lower MPR (<0.8).
Better adherence to thyroid hormone medication may be beneficial in preventing incident dementia, especially Alzheimer disease, in older adults with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism. Along with the resolution of hypothyroid symptoms and the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors, the reduction of dementia risk may be another potential benefit of thyroid hormone medication.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'levothyroxine', 'liothyronine', 'thyroid dysfunction', 'vascular dementia']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-07-29,"[{'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Saemi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, South Korea.\nDepartment of Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeong', 'firstname': 'Seogsong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, CHA University School of Medicine, Seongnam 13448, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Seulggie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Sun Jae', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Kyae Hyung', 'initials': 'KH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Gyeongsil', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Yoosun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Total Healthcare Center, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 04514, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Son', 'firstname': 'Joung Sik', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul 08308, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Sang Min', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, South Korea.\nDepartment of Family Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.'}]",,"Better adherence to thyroid hormone medication may be beneficial in preventing incident dementia, especially Alzheimer disease, in older adults with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism.

This study evaluated dementia risk factors and risk scores among cisgender, transgender, and non-binary adults.
Observational data were drawn from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. A matched-cohort approach was used to develop sex (male, female) and gender identity cohorts (cisgender men, cisgender women, transgender men, transgender women, and non-binary adults) for comparison. Dementia risk scores were calculated using established mid-life and late-life risk score algorithms.
Males had higher overall mid-life dementia risk, and lower late-life Alzheimer's disease risk compared to females. Transgender men, transgender women, and non-binary adults had higher overall late-life risk compared to both cisgender men and women.
Future research is needed to build the evidence base for specific risk factors that may be contributing to higher overall risk among understudied and underserved gender groups.
Using data from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, this matched-cohort study found that those assigned female at birth had lower overall mid-life dementia risk and higher overall late-life Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk compared to those assigned male at birth. Transgender men, transgender women, and non-binary adults all showed higher overall late-life AD risk compared to cisgender men and cisgender women. Between-group differences were found in the incidence of specific risk and protective factors for dementia and AD.","[""Alzheimer's disease risk"", 'dementia risk', 'gender', 'sex', 'sex and gender differences']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2023-07-26,"[{'lastname': 'Brady', 'firstname': 'Brooke', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of New South Wales Sydney, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.\nUNSW Ageing Futures Institute, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Lidan', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of New South Wales Sydney, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.\nUNSW Ageing Futures Institute, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kootar', 'firstname': 'Scherazad', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience Research Australia, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.\nUNSW Ageing Futures Institute, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Anstey', 'firstname': 'Kaarin Jane', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of New South Wales Sydney, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.\nUNSW Ageing Futures Institute, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.'}]",,,"Males had higher overall mid-life dementia risk, and lower late-life Alzheimer's disease risk compared to females.

25594512","Association of Early-, Middle-, and Late-Life Depression With Incident Dementia in a Danish Cohort.","Late-life depressive symptoms are associated with subsequent dementia diagnosis and may be an early symptom or response to preclinical disease. Evaluating associations with early- and middle-life depression will help clarify whether depression influences dementia risk.
To examine associations of early-, middle-, and late-life depression with incident dementia.
This was a nationwide, population-based, cohort study conducted from April 2020 to March 2023. Participants included Danish citizens from the general population with depression diagnoses who were matched by sex and birth year to individuals with no depression diagnosis. Participants were followed up from 1977 to 2018. Excluded from analyses were individuals followed for less than 1 year, those younger than 18 years, or those with baseline dementia.
Depression was defined using diagnostic codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) within the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) and Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR).
Incident dementia was defined using ICD diagnostic codes within the DPCRR and DNPR. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine associations between depression and dementia adjusting for education, income, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, anxiety disorders, stress disorders, substance use disorders, and bipolar disorder. Analyses were stratified by age at depression diagnosis, years since index date, and sex.
There were 246 499 individuals (median [IQR] age, 50.8 [34.7-70.7] years; 159 421 women [64.7%]) with diagnosed depression and 1 190 302 individuals (median [IQR] age, 50.4 [34.6-70.0] years; 768 876 women [64.6%]) without depression. Approximately two-thirds of those diagnosed with depression were diagnosed before the age of 60 years (684 974 [67.7%]). The hazard of dementia among those diagnosed with depression was 2.41 times that of the comparison cohort (95% CI, 2.35-2.47). This association persisted when the time elapsed from the index date was longer than 20 to 39 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.58-2.04) and among those diagnosed with depression in early, middle, or late life (18-44 years: HR, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.64-3.58; 45-59 years: HR, 2.95; 95% CI, 2.75-3.17; ≥60 years: HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.25-2.38).

30920115",Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease in Men with Late-Life Hypertension Is Ameliorated by FOXO3 Longevity Genotype.,"It is well established that mid-life hypertension increases risk of dementia, whereas the association of late-life hypertension with dementia is unclear.
To determine whether FOXO3 longevity-associated genotype influences the association between late-life hypertension and incident dementia.
Subjects were 2,688 American men of Japanese ancestry (baseline age: 77.0±4.1 years, range 71-93 years) from the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program. Status was known for FOXO3 rs2802292 genotype, hypertension, and diagnosis of incident dementia to 2012. Association of FOXO3 genotype with late-life hypertension and incident dementia, vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.
During 21 years of follow-up, 725 men were diagnosed with all-cause dementia, 513 with AD, and 104 with VaD. A multivariable Cox model, adjusting for age, education, APOEɛ4, and cardiovascular risk factors, showed late-life hypertension increased VaD risk only (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.08-2.71, p = 0.022). We found no significant protective effect of FOXO3 longevity genotype on any type of dementia at the population level. However, in a full Cox model adjusting for age, education, APOEɛ4, and other cardiovascular risk factors, there was a significant interaction effect of late-life hypertension and FOXO3 longevity genotype on incident AD (β= -0.52, p = 0.0061). In men with FOXO3 rs2802292 longevity genotype (TG/GG), late-life hypertension showed protection against AD (HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.55-0.95, p = 0.021). The non-longevity genotype (TT) (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.90-1.51, p = 0.25) had no protective effect.
This longitudinal study found late-life hypertension was associated with lower incident AD in subjects with FOXO3 genotype.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'FOXO3', 'genetics', 'hypertension', 'longitudinal study', 'vascular\ndementia\n']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Randi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'NIH Center of Biomedical Reseach Excellence on Aging, Kuakini Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Morris', 'firstname': 'Brian J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'NIH Center of Biomedical Reseach Excellence on Aging, Kuakini Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, USA.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, John A.

27683670",Dementia Risk and Disadvantaged Neighborhoods.,"Residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood may be associated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia but is understudied in nationally representative populations.
To investigate the association between the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and dementia.
Retrospective cohort study within the US Veterans Health Administration from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2021, with a national cohort of older veterans receiving care in the largest integrated health care system in the United States. For each fiscal year, a 5% random sample was selected from all patients (n = 2 398 659). Patients with missing ADI information (n = 492 721) or missing sex information (n = 6) and prevalent dementia cases (n = 25 379) were excluded. Participants had to have at least 1 follow-up visit (n = 1 662 863). The final analytic sample was 1 637 484.
Neighborhoods were characterized with the ADI, which combines several sociodemographic indicators (eg, income, education, employment, and housing) into a census block group-level index of disadvantage. Participants were categorized into ADI rank quintiles by their census block group of residence (higher ADI rank quintile corresponds with more deprivation).
Time to dementia diagnosis (using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes) was estimated with Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale, and the sensitivity of the findings was evaluated with Fine-Gray proportional hazards models, accounting for competing risk of death.
Among the 1 637 484 Veterans Health Administration patients, the mean (SD) age was 68.6 (7.7) years, and 1 604 677 (98.0%) were men. A total of 7318 patients were Asian (0.4%), 151 818 (9.3%) were Black, 10 591 were Hispanic (0.6%), 1 422 713 (86.9%) were White, and 45 044 (2.8%) were of other or unknown race and ethnicity. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 11.0 (4.8) years, 12.8% of veterans developed dementia. Compared with veterans in the least disadvantaged neighborhood quintile, those in greater disadvantage groups had an increased risk of dementia in models adjusted for sex, race and ethnicity, and psychiatric and medical comorbid conditions (first quintile = reference; second quintile adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.09 [95% CI, 1.07-1.10]; third quintile adjusted HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.12-1.15]; fourth quintile adjusted HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.14-1.18]; and fifth quintile adjusted HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.21-1.24]). Repeating the main analysis using competing risk for mortality led to similar results.

27333827",Association of a Blood-Based Aging Biomarker Index With Death and Chronic Disease: Cardiovascular Health Study.,"A goal of gerontology is to discover phenotypes that reflect biological aging distinct from disease pathogenesis. Biomarkers that are strongly associated with mortality could be used to define such a phenotype. However, the relation of such an index with multiple chronic conditions warrants further exploration.
A biomarker index (BI) was constructed in the Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 3 197), with a mean age of 74 years. The BI incorporated circulating levels of new biomarkers, including insulin-like growth factor-1, interleukin-6, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, cystatin-C, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha soluble receptor 1, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose, and was built based on their relationships with mortality. Cox proportional hazards models predicting a composite of death and chronic disease involving cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer were calculated with 6 years of follow-up.
The hazard ratio (HR, 95% CI) for the composite outcome of death or chronic disease per category of BI was 1.65 (1.52, 1.80) and 1.75 (1.58, 1.94) in women and men, respectively. The HR (95% CI) per 5 years of age was 1.57 (1.48, 1.67) and 1.55 (1.44, 1.67) in women and men, respectively. Moreover, BI could attenuate the effect of age on the composite outcome by 16.7% and 22.0% in women and men, respectively.
Biomarker index was significantly and independently associated with a composite outcome of death and chronic disease, and attenuated the effect of age. The BI that is composed of plasma biomarkers may be a practical intermediate phenotype for interventions aiming to modify the course of aging.","['Aging', 'Biomarker', 'Multimorbidity']","The journals of gerontology.

56,37427608,Exploring the occurrence and the risk factors of the desire for hastened death and depression in people with early-stage dementia in Greece.,"To assess the factors associated with desire for hastened death and depression in early-stage dementia as well as the association between them. Also, to explore the mediator and moderator role of age in the relationship between depression and desire for hasten death.
A prospective cross-sectional study including 100 patients diagnosed with early-stage dementia from a rehabilitation center between December 2018 and July 2019. Measurement tools used were the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Greek Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Greek Schedule of Attitudes toward Hastened Death, and the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 item. Patients diagnosed with dementia as a result of Stroke history were excluded.
Factors of multifactorial analysis significantly associated with desire for hastened death were as follows: age (
The desire for hastened death and depression in people diagnosed with early-stage dementia includes many components. Younger patients, men, higher educated patients, single, childless, and those with higher depression scores had higher desire for hastened death, while men and older patients had higher scores of desire for depression. Our study provides important information about the desire for hastened death and depression in early-stage dementia, their risk factors, and their association.","['Alzheimer', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Depression', 'Desire for hastened death', 'Early-stage dementia']",Palliative & supportive care,2023-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Kostopoulou', 'firstname': 'Sotiria', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Pain Relief and Palliative Care Unit, Aretaieion Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Varveri', 'firstname': 'Athina Pinelopi', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'One Day Clinic Chemotherapy, Eugenideio Hospital, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Nikoloudi', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Pain Relief and Palliative Care Unit, Aretaieion Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsilika', 'firstname': 'Eleni', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Health Psychologist, Pain Relief and Palliative Care Unit, Aretaieion Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Parpa', 'firstname': 'Efi', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Pain Relief and Palliative Care Unit, Aretaieion Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Zygogianni', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiology, Areteion Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Mystakidou', 'firstname': 'Kyriaki', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Pain Relief and Palliative Care Unit, Aretaieion Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.'}]",,,Factors of multifactorial analysis significantly associated with desire for hastened death were as follows: age (,,10.1017/S1478951523001062,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05da0d8900>,,,,,,

34000009",Contribution of Conventional Cardiovascular Risk Factors to Brain White Matter Hyperintensities.,"Background White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are a major risk factor for stroke and dementia, but their pathogenesis is incompletely understood. It has been debated how much risk is accounted for by conventional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), and this has major implications as to how effective a preventative strategy targeting these risk factors will be. Methods and Results We included 41 626 UK Biobank participants (47.2% men), with a mean age of 55 years (SD, 7.5 years), who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging at the first imaging assessment beginning in 2014. The relationships among CVRFs, cardiovascular conditions, and WMH volume as a percentage of total brain volume were examined using correlations and structural equation models. Only 32% of the variance in WMH volume was explained by measures of CVRFs, sex, and age, of which age accounted for 16%. CVRFs combined accounted for ≈15% of the variance. However, a large portion of the variance (well over 60%) remains unexplained. Of the individual CVRFs, blood pressure parameters together accounted for ≈10.5% of the total variance (diagnosis of hypertension, 4.4%; systolic blood pressure, 4.4%; and diastolic blood pressure, 1.7%). The variance explained by most individual CVRFs declined with age. Conclusions Our findings suggest the presence of other vascular and nonvascular factors underlying the development of WMHs. Although they emphasize the importance of modification of conventional CVRFs, particularly hypertension, they highlight the need to better understand risk factors underlying the considerable unexplained variance in WMHs if we are to develop better preventative approaches.","['cardiovascular risk factors', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'structural equation modeling', 'white matter hyperintensities']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2023-07-08,"[{'lastname': 'Koohi', 'firstname': 'Fatemeh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group Department of Clinical Neurosciences University of Cambridge Cambridge United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Harshfield', 'firstname': 'Eric L', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group Department of Clinical Neurosciences University of Cambridge Cambridge United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Markus', 'firstname': 'Hugh S', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group Department of Clinical Neurosciences University of Cambridge Cambridge United Kingdom.'}]",,,,,"10.1161/JAHA.123.030676

59,37406451,Knowledge and motivation to adopt recommended health behaviours to reduce dementia risk among the elderly in Norway: a qualitative study.,"Dementia is a major healthcare challenge; however, there is evidence that modifiable risk factors may contribute to reduce dementia risk. The aim of the study was to explore the knowledge and motivation for adopting recommended health behaviours among older adults in Norway.
The study has a qualitative, descriptive design.
Individual interviews were used for data collection. The study population comprised 15 participants, five men and 10 women, aged ≥73 years, recruited from a region in the centre of Norway. Interviews were analysed according to qualitative content analysis.
Three categories were identified and presented as the main findings, as follows: (1) sufficient knowledge about risk reduction for dementia, including the media as the main source of information; (2) current prevention activities and motivation for risk reduction, including physical, social and cognitive activities and a healthy diet; and (3) motivation for prevention of dementia from a life-course perspective, including experience of health problems, desire to live independently and limited awareness of dementia risk factors in midlife.
To tailor information about the modifiable risk factors of dementia and develop preventive interventions, knowledge about motivating factors is essential. Promotion of healthy ageing is required in addition to addressing the fear of future illness and dependency.","['Dementia', 'Healthy lifestyle', 'Motivation', 'Prevention', 'Public health', 'Risk factors']",Public health,2023-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Kjelvik', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'The Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, Tønsberg, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Selbæk', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'The Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, Tønsberg, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Rokstad', 'firstname': 'A M M', 'initials': 'AMM', 'affiliation': 'The Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, Tønsberg, Norway; Faculty of Health Sciences and Social Care, Molde University College, Molde, Norway.

60,37392635,"Bowel movement frequency, stool consistency, and risk of disabling dementia: a population-based cohort study in Japan.","This population-based study aimed to evaluate the association between bowel habits from midlife and dementia.
This was a cohort study using certification records for national long-term care insurance in Japan.
Participants aged 50 to 79 years who reported bowel habits from eight districts within the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (JPHC Study) were followed from 2006 to 2016 for incident dementia. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for men and women separately using Cox proportional hazards models accounting for various lifestyle factors and medical histories.
Among 19,396 men and 22,859 women, 1889 men and 2685 women were diagnosed with dementia. In men, the multivariable-adjusted HRs compared with bowel movement frequency (BMF) of once/day were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.87-1.14) for twice/day or more, 1.38 (1.16-1.65) for 5-6 times/week, 1.46 (1.18-1.80) for 3-4 times/week, and 1.79 (1.34-2.39) for <3 times/week (P for trend <0.001). In women, the corresponding HRs were 1.14 (0.998-1.31), 1.03 (0.91-1.17), 1.16 (1.01-1.33), and 1.29 (1.08-1.55) (P for trend = 0.043). Harder stool was associated with higher risk (P for trend: 0.0030 for men and 0.024 for women), with adjusted HRs compared to normal stool of 1.30 (1.08-1.57) for hard stool and 2.18 (1.23-3.85) for very hard stool in men, and 1.15 (1.002-1.32) and 1.84 (1.29-2.63) in women.

23328000","Sex-Related Differences in the Pharmacological Response in SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Dyslipidemia, and Diabetes Mellitus: A Narrative Review.","Pharmacological responses vary by sex in several illnesses. This narrative review summarizes sex variations in pharmaceutical response in SARS-CoV-2 infection, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is more severe and deadly in men than women. This may be attributed to immunological responses, genetics, and hormones. Some research shows that men may respond better to genomic vaccinations and females to antiviral medications such as remdesivir (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech). In dyslipidemia, women tend to have greater HDL-C and lower LDL-C than men. Some studies show that females may need lower statin dosages than men to obtain equal LDL-C reductions. Ezetimibe co-administered with a statin significantly improved lipid profile indicators in men compared to women. Statins reduce dementia risk. Atorvastatin decreased dementia risk in males (adjusted HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97), whereas lovastatin lowered dementia risk in women (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95). In diabetes mellitus, evidence suggests that females may have a higher risk of developing certain complications such as diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, despite having lower rates of cardiovascular disease than males. This could be the result of differences in hormonal influences and genetic factors. Some research shows females may respond better to oral hypoglycemic medications such as metformin. In conclusion, sex-related differences in pharmacological response have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Further research is needed to better understand these differences and to develop personalized treatment strategies for males and females with these conditions.","['COVID-19', 'adverse drug reactions', 'antidiabetic drugs', 'differences in pharmacological response', 'lipid-lowering agents', 'pharmacodynamics']","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-06-28,"[{'lastname': 'Lombrea', 'firstname': 'Adelina', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Doctoral School, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.\nResearch Center for Pharmaco-Toxicological Evaluation, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Romanescu', 'firstname': 'Mirabela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Doctoral School, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Jianu', 'firstname': 'Narcisa', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Doctoral School, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Andor', 'firstname': 'Minodora', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.\nMultidisciplinary Heart Research Center, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 340001 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Suciu', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Pharmaco-Toxicological Evaluation, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.\nFaculty of Pharmacy, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Man', 'firstname': 'Dana Emilia', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Danciu', 'firstname': 'Corina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Pharmaco-Toxicological Evaluation, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.\nFaculty of Pharmacy, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Dehelean', 'firstname': 'Cristina Adriana', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Pharmaco-Toxicological Evaluation, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.\nFaculty of Pharmacy, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Buda', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Pharmaco-Toxicological Evaluation, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.\nFaculty of Pharmacy, ""Victor Babeş"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie Murgu Street, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.\nIneu City Hospital, 2 Republicii Street, 315300 Ineu, Romania.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ph16060853

62,37355906,Sex Differences in the Association Between Body Mass Index and Dementia Risk in Community-Dwelling Japanese People Aged 40-74 Years.,"The association between body mass index (BMI) and dementia risk is heterogeneous across age groups and might be influenced by sex.
This study aimed to clarify sex differences in the association between BMI and dementia risk in community-dwelling people.
This cohort study with an 8-year follow-up targeted 13,802 participants aged 40-74 years at baseline in 2011-2013. A self-administered questionnaire requested information on body size, including height, weight, and waist circumference (the values of which were validated by direct measurement), socio-demographics, lifestyle, and disease history. BMI was calculated and categorized as < 18.5 (underweight), 18.5-20.6 (low-normal), 20.7-22.6 (mid-normal), 22.7-24.9 (high-normal), 25.0-29.9 (overweight), and≥30.0 kg/m2 (obese). Incident cases of dementia were obtained from the long-term care insurance database. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs).
The mean age of participants was 59.0 years. In men, higher BMI was associated with lower dementia risk (fully-adjusted p for trend = 0.0086). In women, the association between BMI and dementia risk was U-shaped; the ""underweight,"" ""low-normal,"" and ""overweight"" groups had a significantly higher risk (fully-adjusted HR = 2.12, 2.08, and 1.78, respectively) than the reference (""high-normal"" group). These findings did not change after excluding dementia cases which occurred within the first four years of the follow-up period.
Overweight/obese women, but not men, had an increased risk of dementia, suggesting that sex differences in adiposity might be involved in the development of dementia.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'body mass index', 'cohort study', 'dementia', 'risk factor', 'sex difference', 'waist circumference']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-06-25,"[{'lastname': 'Zakharova', 'firstname': 'Alena', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Preventive Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.\nDepartment of Public Health and Health Care, Krasnoyarsk State Medical University named after Professor V.F.

28596452",Improvement in the Prediction of Cerebrovascular Events With White Matter Hyperintensity.,"Background It remains unclear if white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging adds relevant cerebrovascular prognostic information beyond vascular risk factors and demographics alone. Methods and Results We performed a post hoc analysis of hypertensive individuals in SPRINT-MIND (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial-Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension). The primary outcome was incident stroke or cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment or dementia). We fit logistic regression models with the predictors of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score, age, sex, race, education, current cigarette smoking, and the SPRINT-MIND randomization arm. WMH was subsequently included in the model to determine if it improved area under the receiver operating curve using the DeLong test. We used a structural equation model to determine the indirect effect on the primary outcome mediated through WMH. We included 727 individuals (mean age at baseline 67.7±8.4 years, 61.1% were men, 62.6% were non-Hispanic White, and mean years of follow-up was 3.6±0.9). Of the 727 individuals, 67 (9.2%) developed incident stroke or cognitive decline. The area under the receiver operating curve of the baseline model (without WMH) was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.81), and after the addition of WMH it increased to 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.86) (","['brain magnetic resonance imaging', 'cognitive impairment', 'stroke', 'vascular risk', 'white matter hyperintensity']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2023-06-22,"[{'lastname': 'de Havenon', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Yale University New Haven CT USA.\nCenter for Brain and Mind Health Yale University New Haven CT USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Eric E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences University of Calgary Alberta Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Richa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Yale University New Haven CT USA.\nCenter for Brain and Mind Health Yale University New Haven CT USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Falcone', 'firstname': 'Guido J', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Yale University New Haven CT USA.\nCenter for Brain and Mind Health Yale University New Haven CT USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bangad', 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Yale University New Haven CT USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Prabhakaran', 'firstname': 'Shyam', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology University of Chicago IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sheth', 'firstname': 'Kevin N', 'initials': 'KN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology Yale University New Haven CT USA.\nCenter for Brain and Mind Health Yale University New Haven CT USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1161/JAHA.123.029374

35738479",Higher cortical thickness/volume in Alzheimer's-related regions: protective factor or risk factor?,"Some evidence suggests a biphasic pattern of changes in cortical thickness wherein higher, rather than lower, thickness is associated with very early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. We examined whether integrating information from AD brain signatures based on mean diffusivity (MD) can aid in the interpretation of cortical thickness/volume as a risk factor for future AD-related changes. Participants were 572 men in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline (mean age = 56 years; range = 51-60). Individuals with both high thickness/volume signatures and high MD signatures at baseline had lower cortical thickness/volume in AD signature regions and lower episodic memory performance 12 years later compared to those with high thickness/volume and low MD signatures at baseline. Groups did not differ in level of young adult cognitive reserve. Our findings are in line with a biphasic model in which increased cortical thickness may precede future decline and establish the value of examining cortical MD alongside cortical thickness to identify subgroups with differential risk for poorer brain and cognitive outcomes.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Cortical thickness', 'Mean diffusivity', 'Neuroimaging', 'Signatures']",Neurobiology of aging,2023-06-22,"[{'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'McKenna E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA; Joint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, San Diego State University/University of California, San Diego, CA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.

24145578",Undiagnosed Cognitive Impairment and Impact on Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Among People With HIV Infection in Primary Care.,"Little is known about the prevalence of undiagnosed cognitive impairment and its impact on instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among people with HIV (PWH) in primary care.
PWH were recruited from an integrated health care setting in the United States. PWH were eligible for recruitment if they were ≥50 years old, taking antiretroviral therapy (ie, ≥1 antiretroviral therapy [ART] prescription fill in the past year), and had no clinical diagnosis of dementia. Participants completed a cognitive screen (St. Louis University Mental Status exam) and a questionnaire on IADL (modified Lawton-Brody).
Study participants (n = 47) were mostly male (85.1%), 51.1% White, 25.5% Black, 17.0% Hispanic, and the average age (SD) was 59.7 (7.0) years. Overall, 27 (57.5%) participants were categorized as cognitively normal, 17 (36.2%) as having mild cognitive impairment, and 3 (6.4%) as having possible dementia. Of the 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment or possible dementia, 85.0% were men, the average age (SD) was 60.4 (7.1) years; 45.0% were White, 40.0% were Black, 10.0% were Hispanic, and 30.0% reported difficulty with at least 1 IADL. Most (66.7%) attributed difficulty with IADL primarily (33.3%) or in part (33.3%) to cognitive problems.
Undiagnosed cognitive impairment is frequent among ART-treated PWH, with possible elevated risk among Black PWH, and may be accompanied by difficulty with IADL. Efforts are needed to optimize identification of factors contributing to cognitive and IADL difficulties among ART-treated PWH in primary care.","['activities of daily living', 'aging', 'cognitive impairment', 'dementia', 'everyday functioning', 'function']",Open forum infectious diseases,2023-06-21,"[{'lastname': 'Lam', 'firstname': 'Jennifer O', 'initials': 'JO', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Craig E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'South San Francisco Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, South San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilsanz', 'firstname': 'Paola', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lea', 'firstname': 'Alexandra N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Satre', 'firstname': 'Derek D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Silverberg', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.'}]",,,"Study participants (n = 47) were mostly male (85.1%), 51.1% White, 25.5% Black, 17.0% Hispanic, and the average age (SD) was 59.7 (7.0) years.

66,37331448,Gender differences in modifiable dementia risk factors in monolingual and bilingual Australian adults.,"Gender and bilingualism are reported to influence the risk of dementia. This study examined the prevalence of self-reported modifiable dementia risk factors by gender in two samples: one that speaks at least one language other than English (LoE) and one that speaks only English.
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of Australian residents aged 50 years or over (n = 4339). Participant characteristics and dementia risk behaviours were inspected using descriptive statistics in data collected via online surveys between October 2020 and November 2021.
In both samples, men had a higher rate than women of being overweight and were classified more frequently as being at risk of dementia due to alcohol consumption, lower cognitive activity, and non-adherence to the Mediterranean-style diet. Men reported better management of their cardiometabolic health than women across both groups. Non-significant trends showed men were more often smokers but more physically active than women in the LoE group, and less often smokers but less physically active than women in the English-only group.
This study found men and women reported similar patterns of dementia risk behaviours regardless of LoE or English-only status. SO WHAT?: Gender differences in risk behaviours prevail regardless of language-speaking status. The results can be used to guide future research aiming to understand and reduce modifiable dementia risk in Australia and beyond.","['bilingual', 'brief report', 'dementia', 'gender', 'monolingual', 'risk']",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2023-06-19,"[{'lastname': 'Hamrah', 'firstname': 'Mohammad Shoaib', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bartlett', 'firstname': 'Larissa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kitsos', 'firstname': 'Alex', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Vickers', 'firstname': 'James C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia.'}]",,This study found men and women reported similar patterns of dementia risk behaviours regardless of LoE or English-only status.

67,37331246,The relationship between long-term blood pressure variability and cortical thickness in older adults.,"High blood pressure variability (BPV) is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, but its association with cortical thickness is not well understood. Here we use a topographical approach, to assess links between long-term BPV and cortical thickness in 478 (54% men at baseline) community dwelling older adults (70-88 years) from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly NEURO sub-study. BPV was measured as average real variability, based on annual visits across three years. Higher diastolic BPV was significantly associated with reduced cortical thickness in multiple areas, including temporal (banks of the superior temporal sulcus), parietal (supramarginal gyrus, post-central gyrus), and posterior frontal areas (pre-central gyrus, caudal middle frontal gyrus), while controlling for mean BP. Higher diastolic BPV was associated with faster progression of cortical thinning across the three years. Diastolic BPV is an important predictor of cortical thickness, and trajectory of cortical thickness, independent of mean blood pressure. This finding suggests an important biological link in the relationship between BPV and cognitive decline in older age.","['Ageing', 'Dementia', 'Grey matter', 'Hypertension', 'MRI']",Neurobiology of aging,2023-06-19,"[{'lastname': 'Gutteridge', 'firstname': 'D S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Cognitive Ageing and Impairment Neuroscience Laboratory (CAIN), University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

We aimed to investigate whether consumption of tea and different types of coffee at midlife are associated with dementia later in life and whether sex or ApoE4 influence such association.
We included 7381 participants from the Norwegian HUNT Study. Self-reported questionnaires assessed daily consumption of coffee and tea at baseline. After 22 years, individuals 70 years or older were screened for cognitive impairment.
General coffee consumption and tea consumption was not associated with dementia risk. Compared to daily consumption of 0-1 cups of coffee, daily consumption of ≥8 cups of boiled coffee was associated with increased dementia risk in women (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.10-3.04,

23269325",Cognitive Impairment and Self-Reported Dementia in UK Retired Professional Soccer Players: A Cross Sectional Comparative Study.,"Previous studies based on death certificates have found professional soccer players were more likely to die with neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether retired professional male soccer players would perform worse on cognitive tests and be more likely to self-report dementia diagnosis than general population control men.
A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted between August 2020 and October 2021 in the United Kingdom (UK). Professional soccer players were recruited through different soccer clubs in England, and general population control men were recruited from the East Midlands in the UK. We obtained self-reported postal questionnaire data on dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases, comorbidities and risk factors from 468 soccer players and 619 general population controls. Of these, 326 soccer players and 395 general population controls underwent telephone assessment for cognitive function.
Retired soccer players were approximately twice as likely to score below established dementia screening cut-off scores on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (OR 2.06, 95%CI 1.11-3.83) and Verbal Fluency (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.68), but not the Test Your Memory, modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Analyses were adjusted for age, education, hearing loss, body mass index, stroke, circulatory problems in the legs and concussion. While retired soccer players were younger, had fewer cardiovascular diseases and other morbidities and reported healthier lifestyles, 2.8% of retired soccer players reported medically diagnosed dementia and other neurodegenerative disease compared to 0.9% of controls (OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.25-9.63) after adjustment for age and possible confounders.
UK male retired soccer players had a higher risk of performing below established cut-off scores of dementia screening tests and were more likely to self-report medically diagnosed dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, despite having better overall physical health and fewer dementia risk factors. Further study is needed to determine specific soccer-related risk factors.","['Cognitive function', 'General population', 'Self-reported dementia', 'Soccer players']",Sports medicine - open,2023-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Macnab', 'firstname': 'Tara-Mei Povall', 'initials': 'TP', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.\nNational Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine (NCSEM), School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Espahbodi', 'firstname': 'Shima', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.\nVersus Arthritis Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\nPain Centre Versus Arthritis, Academic Rheumatology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hogervorst', 'firstname': 'Eef', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine (NCSEM), School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Thanoon', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.\nVersus Arthritis Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\nPain Centre Versus Arthritis, Academic Rheumatology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernandes', 'firstname': 'Gwen Sascha', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.\nPopulation Health Science, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Millar', 'firstname': 'Bonnie', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.\nPain Centre Versus Arthritis, Academic Rheumatology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.\nNIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Duncan', 'firstname': 'Ashley', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Goodwin', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine (NCSEM), School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Batt', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Versus Arthritis Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuller', 'firstname': 'Colin W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Colin Fuller Consultancy Ltd, Sutton Bonington, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuller', 'firstname': 'Gordon', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Urgent and Emergency Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferguson', 'firstname': 'Eamonn', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Pain Centre Versus Arthritis, Academic Rheumatology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.\nSchool of Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\nNIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bast', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Pain Centre Versus Arthritis, Academic Rheumatology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.\nSchool of Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\nNeuroscience@Nottingham, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\nNIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Doherty', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.\nVersus Arthritis Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\nPain Centre Versus Arthritis, Academic Rheumatology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.\nNIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Weiya', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Building, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.

23902706",Increase in skeletal muscular adiposity and cognitive decline in a biracial cohort of older men and women.,"Obesity and loss of muscle mass are emerging as risk factors for dementia, but the role of adiposity infiltrating skeletal muscles is less clear. Skeletal muscle adiposity increases with older age and especially among Black women, a segment of the US population who is also at higher risk for dementia.
In 1634 adults (69-79 years, 48% women, 35% Black), we obtained thigh intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) via computerized tomography at Years 1 and 6, and mini-mental state exam (3MS) at Years 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10. Linear mixed effects models tested the hypothesis that increased IMAT (Year 1-6) would be associated with 3MS decline (Year 5-10). Models were adjusted for traditional dementia risk factors at Year 1 (3MS, education, APOe4 allele, diabetes, hypertension, and physical activity), with interactions between IMAT change by race or sex. To assess the influence of other muscle and adiposity characteristics, models accounted for change in muscle strength, muscle area, body weight, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adiposity, and total body fat mass (all measured in Years 1 and 6). Models were also adjusted for cytokines related to adiposity: leptin, adiponectin, and interleukin-6.
Thigh IMAT increased by 4.85 cm
Clinicians should be aware that regional adiposity accumulating in the skeletal muscle may be an important, novel risk factor for cognitive decline in Black and White participants independent of changes to muscle strength, body composition and traditional dementia risk factors.","['Black', 'cognitive decline', 'dementia', 'intermuscular adiposity']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2023-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Rosano', 'firstname': 'Caterina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Newman', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Santanasto', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Xiaonan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Goodpaster', 'firstname': 'Bret', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Translational Research Institute, AdventHealth, Orlando, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Miljkovic', 'firstname': 'Iva', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.'}]",,,Thigh IMAT increased by 4.85 cm,© 2023 The American Geriatrics Society.,10.1111/jgs.18419,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05db27ae50>,,,,,,
71,37263368,"Visit-to-visit HbA1c variability, dementia, and hippocampal atrophy among adults without diabetes.","Adults without diabetes are not completely healthy; they are probably heterogeneous with several potential health problems. The management of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is crucial among patients with diabetes; but whether similar management strategy is needed for adults without diabetes is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the associations of visit-to-visit HbA1c variability with incident dementia and hippocampal volume among middle-aged and older adults without diabetes, providing potential insights into this question.
We conducted a prospective analysis for incident dementia in 10,792 participants (mean age 58.9 years, 47.8 % men) from the UK Biobank. A subgroup of 3793 participants (mean age 57.8 years, 48.6 % men) was included in the analysis for hippocampal volume. We defined HbA1c variability as the difference in HbA1c divided by the mean HbA1c over the 2 sequential visits ([latter - former]/mean). Dementia was identified using hospital inpatient records with ICD-9 codes. T1-structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was conducted to derive hippocampal volume (normalized for head size). The nonlinear and linear associations were examined using restricted cubic spline (RCS) models, Cox regression models, and multiple linear regression models.
During a mean follow-up (since the second round) of 8.4 years, 90 (0.8 %) participants developed dementia. The RCS models suggested no significant nonlinear associations of HbA1c variability with incident dementia and hippocampal volume, respectively (All P > 0.05). Above an optimal cutoff of HbA1c variability at 0.08, high HbA1c variability (increment in HbA1c) was associated with an increased risk of dementia (Hazard Ratio, 1.88; 95 % Confidence Interval, 1.13 to 3.14, P = 0.015), and lower hippocampal volume (coefficient, -96.84 mm
Among middle-aged and older adults without diabetes, increasing visit-to-visit HbA1c variability was associated with an increased dementia risk and lower hippocampal volume. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring and controlling HbA1c fluctuation in apparently healthy adults without diabetes.","['Dementia', 'Diabetes', 'HbA1c variability', 'Hippocampal volume', 'Middle-aged and older adults']",Experimental gerontology,2023-06-02,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Chenxi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Junyan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Yining', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Kaili', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Abdelrahman', 'firstname': 'Zeinab', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, China; NHC and CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, MOE Frontier Science Center for Brain Research and Brain-Machine Integration, School of Brain Science and Brain Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Xingqi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Jingyun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Zhoutao', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Changzheng', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Big Data in Health Science School of Public Health, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Huiqian', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yaojing', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Zuyun', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, The Second Affiliated Hospital, The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Preventive Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.

72,37254942,Machine-learning-derived heart and brain age are independently associated with cognition.,"A heart age biomarker has been developed using deep neural networks applied to electrocardiograms. Whether this biomarker is associated with cognitive function was investigated.
Using 12-lead electrocardiograms, heart age was estimated for a population-based sample (N = 7779, age 40-85 years, 45.3% men). Associations between heart delta age (HDA) and cognitive test scores were studied adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the relationship between HDA, brain delta age (BDA) and cognitive test scores was investigated in mediation analysis.
Significant associations between HDA and the Word test, Digit Symbol Coding Test and tapping test scores were found. HDA was correlated with BDA (Pearson's r = 0.12, p = 0.0001). Moreover, 13% (95% confidence interval 3-36) of the HDA effect on the tapping test score was mediated through BDA.

33567248",Cross-sectional survey of attitudes and beliefs towards dementia risk reduction among Australian older adults.,"Little is known about what drives older adults' motivation to change their behaviour and whether that is associated with their personal dementia risk profile. Our aims were to (i) understand what sociodemographic factors are associated with older Australians' motivation to change behaviour to reduce their dementia risk, and (ii) explore the relationship between socio-demographic factors and motivation to reduce dementia risk with health- and lifestyle-based dementia risk scores in older adults.
A cross-sectional online postal or telephone survey was administered to community-dwelling older adults in New South Wales, Australia between January and March 2021. Measures included socioeconomic status, locality, and health status, the Motivation to Change Lifestyle and Health Behaviours for Dementia Risk Reduction (MCLHB-DRR) scale and the lifestyle-based dementia risk score (LIBRA index). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to explore the associations for (i) sociodemographic factors and motivation to reduce dementia risk (MCLHB-DRR scales) and (ii) sociodemographic factors and motivation to reduce dementia risk with health- and lifestyle-based dementia risk (LIBRA index).
A total of 857 older adults (mean age 73.3 years, SD = 6.0, range 65-94; 70% women; 34.6% less than grade 6 education) completed the survey. Respondents reported high levels of motivation to adopt behaviour changes, agreeing on the importance of good health. Individuals who were younger were more likely to have greater motivation to modify lifestyle to reduce dementia risk and had higher perceived benefits to gain by adopting a healthy lifestyle. Dementia risk scores were moderately low (mean LIBRA index =- 2.8 [SD = 2.0], range - 5.9-3.8), indicating relatively moderate-to-good brain health. Men with low socioeconomic status and higher perceived barriers to lifestyle change had higher dementia risk scores.
Public health campaigns need to overcome motivational barriers to support reductions in dementia risk. A multifaceted and inclusive approach targeting both sociodemographic differences and impediments to brain healthy lifestyles is required to achieve genuine change.

34465287",Ideal vitamin D and handgrip strength counteracts the risk effect of APOE genotype on dementia: a population-based longitudinal study.,"Higher vitamin D concentrations and grip strength contribute to lower individual-level risk of dementia, while apolipoprotein 4 (APOE e4) genotype carries increases dementia risk, but whether combination of ideal vitamin D and grip strength counteracts the risk effect of dementia related to APOE e4 genotype remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the interactions between vitamin D/grip strength and APOE e4 genotype and their association with dementia.
The UK Biobank cohort comprised 165,688 dementia-free participants (aged at least 60 years) for the dementia analysis. Dementia was ascertained using hospital inpatient, mortality, and self-reported data until 2021. Vitamin D and grip strength were collected at baseline and divided into tertiles. APOE genotype was coded as APOE e4 non-carries and APOE e4 carries. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models and restricted cubic regression splines, with adjusted for known confounders.
Over the follow-up (median: 12.0 years), 3917 participants developed dementia. In women and men, respectively, compared with to the lowest tertile of vitamin D, the HRs (95% CIs) of dementia were lower in the middle [0.86 (0.76-0.97)/0.80 (0.72-0.90)] and the highest tertile [0.81 (0.72-0.90)/0.73 (0.66-0.81)]. Tertiles of grip strength showed similar patterns. In women and men, respectively, participants who had both highest tertile of vitamin D and grip strength was associated with a lower risk of dementia compared to those with both lowest tertile of these two exposures among APOE e4 genotype carries (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.76, and HR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.64) and APOE e4 genotype non-carries (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.81, and HR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.24-0.47). There were significant additive interactions between lower vitamin D/grip strength and APOE e4 genotype on dementia among women and men.
Higher vitamin D and grip strength were associated with a lower risk of dementia, and seemed to halve the adverse effects of APOE e4 genotype on dementia. Our findings suggested that vitamin D and grip strength may be imperative for estimating the risks of dementia, especially among APOE e4 genotype carries.","['APOE e4 genotype', 'Dementia', 'Grip strength', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Vitamin D']",Journal of translational medicine,2023-05-29,"[{'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Jiangtao', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin NanKai Hospital, Changjiang Road 6, Tianjin, 300100, China.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Tianjin University, Changjiang Road 6, Tianjin, 300100, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Qi', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin NanKai Hospital, Changjiang Road 6, Tianjin, 300100, China.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Tianjin University, Changjiang Road 6, Tianjin, 300100, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin NanKai Hospital, Changjiang Road 6, Tianjin, 300100, China. zhangyuan16@tmu.edu.cn.\nRaymond G.

Using data from 7,672 participants of the Whitehall II prospective cohort study, we examined whether timing of exposure, length of follow-up, or sex modifies this association.
Twelve markers of lipid levels were measured from fasting blood and eight among them a further five times. We performed time-to-event as well as trajectory analyses.
No associations were observed in men; in women most lipids were associated with the risk of dementia, but only for events occurring after the first 20 years of follow-up. Differences in lipid trajectories in men emerged only in the years immediately before diagnosis whereas in women total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C were higher in midlife among dementia cases before declining progressively.
Abnormal lipid levels in midlife seem to be associated with a higher risk of dementia in women.","['dementia', 'lipids']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2023-05-27,"[{'lastname': 'Hassen', 'firstname': 'Céline Ben', 'initials': 'CB', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Machado-Fragua', 'firstname': 'Marcos D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Landré', 'firstname': 'Benjamin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Fayosse', 'firstname': 'Aurore', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Dumurgier', 'firstname': 'Julien', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Paris, France.\nCognitive Neurology Center, Lariboisière - Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kivimaki', 'firstname': 'Mika', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mental Health of Older People, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sabia', 'firstname': 'Séverine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Paris, France.\nDepartment of Mental Health of Older People, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh-Manoux', 'firstname': 'Archana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Paris, France.\nDepartment of Mental Health of Older People, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, London, UK.'}]",,,"No associations were observed in men; in women most lipids were associated with the risk of dementia, but only for events occurring after the first 20 years of follow-up.

23759278",The role of sex differences in depression in pathologically defined Alzheimer's disease.,"Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may contribute to disease heterogeneity and affect prevalence, risk factors, disease trajectories and outcomes. Depression impacts a large number of patients with AD and has been reported to be more prevalent in women. We aimed to better understand the interaction between sex, depression and AD neuropathology, which could have implications for detection of symptoms, earlier diagnosis, therapeutic management, and enhanced quality of life.
We compared 338 cases with clinicopathologically confirmed AD (46% women) to 258 control cases (50% women), without dementia, parkinsonism or a significant pathological diagnosis. Depression was assessed both, using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), and as being reported in their medical history combined with treatment with antidepressant medication.
In the control group, women showed a higher depression severity, and a higher proportion of women were found to meet the cut-off score for depression on the HAM-D (32 vs. 16%) and having an history of depression (33 vs. 21%), while these sex differences were not observed in AD. Further, in both groups, female sex independently predicted the presence of depression, with covariates for age and cognitive status. AD subjects had higher mean HAM-D scores, were more likely to meet cutoff scores for depression (41 vs. 24%) and have a history of depression than controls (47 vs. 27%). When comparing the increase in frequency of depression in controls versus AD, the difference was significantly greater in men (AD men - control men: 24%) than in women (AD women - control women: 9%). Although subjects with depression were more likely to have higher levels of AD neuropathology, these differences were not observed when investigating the control or AD group separately.
Control women had a higher likelihood and severity of depression than control men, but this sex difference was not noted when considering only those with pathologically defined AD, emphasizing the importance of considering sex in aging studies. AD was associated with higher rates of depression and men may be more likely to report or be diagnosed with depression once they develop AD indicating the importance of more frequent depression screenings in men.","['Hamilton rating scale for depression', 'behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia', 'depression', 'gender', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychaitric symptoms', 'postmortem', 'sex differences']",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023-05-26,"[{'lastname': 'Tremblay', 'firstname': 'Cécilia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Choudhury', 'firstname': 'Parichita', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Belden', 'firstname': 'Christine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldfarb', 'firstname': 'Danielle', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Lorenzini', 'firstname': 'Ileana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Beach', 'firstname': 'Thomas G', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Serrano', 'firstname': 'Geidy E', 'initials': 'GE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropathology, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, United States.'}]",,,"In the control group, women showed a higher depression severity, and a higher proportion of women were found to meet the cut-off score for depression on the HAM-D (32 vs. 16%) and having an history of depression (33 vs. 21%), while these sex differences were not observed in AD.

20062809",Menopause causes metabolic and cognitive impairments in a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia.,"The vast majority of women with dementia are post-menopausal. Despite clinical relevance, menopause is underrepresented in rodent models of dementia. Before menopause, women are less likely than men to experience strokes, obesity, and diabetes-known risk factors for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). During menopause, ovarian estrogen production stops and the risk of developing these dementia risk factors spikes. Here, we aimed to determine if menopause worsens cognitive impairment in VCID. We hypothesized that menopause would cause metabolic dysfunction and increase cognitive impairment in a mouse model of VCID.
We performed a unilateral common carotid artery occlusion surgery to produce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and model VCID in mice. We used 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide to induce accelerated ovarian failure and model menopause. We evaluated cognitive impairment using behavioral tests including novel object recognition, Barnes maze, and nest building. To assess metabolic changes, we measured weight, adiposity, and glucose tolerance. We explored multiple aspects of brain pathology including cerebral hypoperfusion and white matter changes (commonly observed in VCID) as well as changes to estrogen receptor expression (which may mediate altered sensitivity to VCID pathology post-menopause).
Menopause increased weight gain, glucose intolerance, and visceral adiposity. VCID caused deficits in spatial memory regardless of menopausal status. Post-menopausal VCID specifically led to additional deficits in episodic-like memory and activities of daily living. Menopause did not alter resting cerebral blood flow on the cortical surface (assessed by laser speckle contrast imaging). In the white matter, menopause decreased myelin basic protein gene expression in the corpus callosum but did not lead to overt white matter damage (assessed by Luxol fast blue). Menopause did not significantly alter estrogen receptor expression (ERα, ERβ, or GPER1) in the cortex or hippocampus.
Overall, we have found that the accelerated ovarian failure model of menopause caused metabolic impairment and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of VCID. Further studies are needed to identify the underlying mechanism. Importantly, the post-menopausal brain still expressed estrogen receptors at normal (pre-menopausal) levels. This is encouraging for any future studies attempting to reverse the effects of estrogen loss by activating brain estrogen receptors.
Nearly all women with dementia are menopausal. Reduced blood flow to the brain, resulting from damaged blood vessels, can lead to vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia. Before menopause, women are less likely than men to experience strokes, obesity, and diabetes—known risk factors for vascular dementia. During menopause, estrogen levels drop and the risk of developing these dementia risk factors increases. The goal of this study was to determine how menopause impacts risk factors (obesity, diabetes), memory and brain pathology in vascular dementia. This study used mouse models of vascular dementia and menopause. Menopause increased weight gain and other indicators of poor metabolic health. In mice with vascular dementia, menopausal mice had worse memory than pre-menopausal mice. After menopause, the brain still expressed estrogen receptors at normal (pre-menopausal) levels. This is encouraging for any future studies attempting to reverse the effects of estrogen loss by activating brain estrogen receptors.","['Cognitive impairment', 'Dementia', 'Estrogen', 'Hypoperfusion', 'Menopause', 'Metabolic', 'Myelin', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Neuroscience', 'Vascular']",Biology of sex differences,2023-05-24,"[{'lastname': 'Gannon', 'firstname': 'Olivia J', 'initials': 'OJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Naik', 'firstname': 'Janvie S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Riccio', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mansour', 'firstname': 'Febronia M', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abi-Ghanem', 'firstname': 'Charly', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Salinero', 'firstname': 'Abigail E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelly', 'firstname': 'Richard D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brooks', 'firstname': 'Heddwen L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ, 85724, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zuloaga', 'firstname': 'Kristen L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA. zuloagk@amc.edu.'}]",,,"Menopause increased weight gain, glucose intolerance, and visceral adiposity.

18401021",Associations Between Circulating Levels of Myostatin and Plasma β-Amyloid 42/40 in a Biracial Cohort of Older Adults.,"Myostatin, a cytokine produced by skeletal muscle, may influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but sparse evidence exists in humans. We assessed the association between circulating levels of myostatin at Year 1 and plasma levels of β-amyloid 42/40 at Year 2, a marker of AD pathology, in a biracial cohort of older adults.
We studied 403 community-dwelling older adults enrolled in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study from Memphis, Tennessee, and Pittsburgh, PA. Mean age was 73.8 ± 3 years; 54% were female; and 52% were Black. Serum myostatin levels were measured at Year 1, plasma β-amyloid 42/40 levels in Year 2 (higher ratio indicating lower amyloid load). Multivariable linear regression analyses tested the association of serum myostatin with plasma levels of β-amyloid 42/40 adjusted for computed-tomography-derived thigh muscle cross-sectional area, demographics, APOe4 allele, and risk factors for dementia. We tested for 2-way.interactions between myostatin and race or sex; results were stratified by race and sex.
In multivariable models, myostatin was positively associated with plasma levels of β-amyloid 42/40 (standardized regression coefficient: 0.145, p = .004). Results were significant for white men and women (0.279, p = .009, and 0.221, p = .035, respectively) but not for Black men or women; interactions by race and gender were not statistically significant.
Higher serum myostatin was associated with lower amyloid burden, independently of APOe4 alleles, muscle area and other established risk factors for dementia. The role of myostatin in AD pathogenesis and the influence of race should be further investigated.","['Alzheimer’s', 'Biomarkers', 'Cognitive aging', 'Muscle']","The journals of gerontology.

80,37212109,Men Are at Higher Risk of Screening Positive for Vascular Cognitive Impairment Compared to Women after Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack.,"While women have greater incidence of dementia, men have higher prevalence of vascular risk factors. This study examined sex differences in risk of screening positive for cognitive impairment after stroke. Ischemic stroke/TIA patients (N = 5969) participated in this prospective, multi-centered study, which screened for cognitive impairment using a validated brief screen. Men showed a higher risk of screening positive for cognitive impairment after adjusting for age, education, stroke severity, and vascular risk factors, suggesting that other factors may be contributing to increased risk among men (OR = 1.34, CI 95% [1.16, 1.55], p < 0.001). The effect of sex on cognitive impairment after stroke warrants further attention.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'cognitive impairment', 'sex difference', 'stroke', 'transient ischemic attack']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-05-22,"[{'lastname': 'Zinman', 'firstname': 'Julia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kapoor', 'firstname': 'Arunima', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Si', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sujanthan', 'firstname': 'Sajeevan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Southwell', 'firstname': 'Alisia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Cayley', 'firstname': 'Megan L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sicard', 'firstname': 'Michelle N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lien', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Murray', 'firstname': 'Brian J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanctôt', 'firstname': 'Krista', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Herrmann', 'firstname': 'Nathan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Dowlatshahi', 'firstname': 'Dar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sahlas', 'firstname': 'Demetrios J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), McMaster University, Hamilton General Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Saposnik', 'firstname': 'Gustavo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Stroke Outcomes and Decision Neuroscience Unit, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Mandzia', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'London Health Sciences Centre, Division of Neurology, London, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Casaubon', 'firstname': 'Leanne K', 'initials': 'LK', 'affiliation': 'University Health Network/Toronto Western Hospital, Division of Neurology, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hassan', 'firstname': 'Ayman', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre, Division of Neurology, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Perez', 'firstname': 'Yael', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Trillium Health Partners, Department of Medicine (Neurology), Mississauga, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Swartz', 'firstname': 'Richard H', 'initials': 'RH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine (Neurology), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-230021,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05da385540>,,,,,,
81,37210874,Gender differences in the association between sensory function and CIND among Chinese elderly: Based on CLHLS.,"To explore the gender differences of the association between sensory impairment (SI) and the risk of cognitive decline and possible cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND).
Data were drawn from three waves of the nationally representative survey of China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) between 2011/12-2018 surveys, involving 6138 participants aged 65 or older who had no CIND at the baseline. Multivariate linear or logistic regression models were employed to examine the effect of SI on cognitive decline and CIND risk by gender stratification, respectively.
Hearing impairment and visual impairment were associated with lower MMSE scores, and the strength of the association was stronger in men than in women. Hearing impairment was related to an elevated risk of CIND both in men and women (Men: OR=2.46; 95% CI=1.81, 3.35; Women: OR=1.43; 95% CI=1.09, 1.88). However, the effect of visual impairment on CIND was statistically significant only in men (OR=1.43; 95% CI=1.09, 1.88). The risk of cognitive decline and CIND were significantly higher with single and dual SI than those without SI, except for women with single visual impairment.
SI is independently associated with cognitive decline and CIND risk, and the association differed by gender. Further researches should clarify the mechanism between SI and cognitive function among older adults, especially for gender differences.","['China', 'Cognitive decline', 'Gender differences', 'Hearing impairment', 'Visual impairment']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2023-05-22,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ping', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhixiang', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Computer science, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Xia', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Yao', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Chinese Medicine and Health Development, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Junyong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Chinese Medicine and Health Development, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330004, China.

3140969",Gender specific factors contributing to cognitive resilience in APOE ɛ4 positive older adults in a population-based sample.,"Although APOE ɛ4 has been identified as the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease, there are some APOE ɛ4 carriers who do not go on to develop Alzheimer's disease or cognitive impairment. This study aims to investigate factors contributing to this ""resilience"" separately by gender. Data were drawn from APOE ɛ4 positive participants who were aged 60 + at baseline in the Personality and Total Health Through Life (PATH) Study (N = 341, Women = 46.3%). Participants were categorised into ""resilient"" and ""non-resilient"" groups using Latent Class Analysis based on their cognitive impairment status and cognitive trajectory across 12 years. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk and protective factors that contributed to resilience stratified by gender. For APOE ɛ4 carriers who have not had a stroke, predictors of resilience were increased frequency of mild physical activity and being employed at baseline for men, and increased number of mental activities engaged in at baseline for women. The results provide insights into a novel way of classifying resilience among APOE ɛ4 carriers and risk and protective factors contributing to resilience separately for men and women.",[],Scientific reports,2023-05-18,"[{'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Lidan', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia. lidan.zheng@unsw.edu.au.\nNeuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Randwick, NSW, Australia. lidan.zheng@unsw.edu.au.\nUNSW Ageing Futures Institute, Kensington, NSW, Australia. lidan.zheng@unsw.edu.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Eramudugolla', 'firstname': 'Ranmalee', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Randwick, NSW, Australia.\nUNSW Ageing Futures Institute, Kensington, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cherbuin', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Research on Ageing, Health and Wellbeing, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Drouin', 'firstname': 'Shannon M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Dixon', 'firstname': 'Roger A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.\nNeuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Anstey', 'firstname': 'Kaarin J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Randwick, NSW, Australia.\nUNSW Ageing Futures Institute, Kensington, NSW, Australia.'}]",,,,© 2023.

31209836",Retinal Functional and Structural Neural Indices: Potential Biomarkers for the Monitoring of Cerebral Neurodegeneration: The Maastricht Study.,"If retinal indices of neurodegeneration are to be biomarkers for the monitoring of cerebral neurodegeneration, it is important to establish whether potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia are associated with retinal neurodegenerative changes.
To study associations of dementia risk factors with retinal sensitivity, an index of retinal neural function, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, an index of retinal neural structure.
We used cross-sectional data from The Maastricht Study (up to 5,666 participants, 50.5% men, mean age 59.7), and investigated associations with regression analyses (adjusted for potential confounders).
Most risk factors under study (i.e., hyperglycemia, unhealthy diet, lower cardiorespiratory fitness, smoking, alcohol consumption, and hypertension) were significantly associated with lower retinal sensitivity and lower RNFL thickness.
Findings of this population-based study support the concept that retinal neural indices may be biomarkers for the monitoring of therapeutic strategies that aim to prevent early-stage cerebral neurodegeneration and, ultimately, dementia.","['Alcohol consumption', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'dementia', 'imaging biomarkers', 'obesity', 'optical coherence tomography',

30549090",Female perspective: the burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in China from 1990 to 2019 and prediction of their prevalence up to 2044.,"Dementia is more prevalent in women than in men across the world, and sex differences are reflected in the burden of dementia borne by women and men. However, a few studies have specifically analyzed the disease burden of dementia in Chinese women.
This article aims to raise awareness of Chinese females with dementia (CFWD), outline an effective response to future trends in China from a female perspective, and provide a reference for the scientific formulation of dementia prevention and treatment policies in China.
In this article, epidemiological data on dementia in Chinese women were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, and three risk factors, namely, smoking, a high body mass index, and a high fasting plasma glucose, were selected for the analysis. This article also predicted the burden of dementia in Chinese women in the next 25 years.
The prevalence of dementia, mortality, and disability-adjusted life year rates increased with age in CFWD in 2019. All three risk factors provided by the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 showed positive correlations for the effect of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates on CFWD. Among them, a high body mass index had the greatest effect (8%) and smoking had the smallest effect (6.4%). Over the next 25 years, the number of CFWD and its prevalence are expected to be on the rise, while mortality is expected to remain relatively stable and decline slightly, but deaths from dementia will continue to increase.
The situation arising due to the spread of dementia among Chinese women in the future is going to become a serious issue. To reduce the burden of dementia, the Chinese government should prioritize its prevention and treatment. A multi-dimensional, long-term care system involving families, community, and hospitals should also be established and supported.","['Alzheimer and other dementias', 'China', 'disease burden', 'female', 'prediction']",Frontiers in public health,2023-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Meng', 'firstname': 'Wenxin', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'School of International Pharmaceutical Business, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.\nThe Research Center of National Drug Policy and Ecosystem, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Jinping', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Regulatory Science, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Ni', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Pingyu', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Fan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Policy and Management, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Rong', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of International Pharmaceutical Business, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.\nThe Research Center of National Drug Policy and Ecosystem, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hua', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of International Pharmaceutical Business, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.'}]",,,"The prevalence of dementia, mortality, and disability-adjusted life year rates increased with age in CFWD in 2019.

29579395",A Traitlike Dimension of Subjective Memory Concern Over 30 Years Among Adult Male Twins.,"Subjective memory concern has long been considered a state-related indicator of impending cognitive decline or dementia. The possibility that subjective memory concern may itself be a heritable trait is largely ignored, yet such an association would substantially confound its use in clinical or research settings.
To assess the heritability and traitlike dimensions of subjective memory concern and its clinical correlates.
This longitudinal twin cohort study was conducted from 1967 to 2019 among male adults with a mean (SD) age of 37.75 (2.52) years to follow-up at mean ages of 56.15 (2.72), 61.50 (2.43), and 67.35 (2.57) years (hereafter, 38, 56, 62, and 67 years, respectively) in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. The study included a national community-dwelling sample with health, education, and lifestyle characteristics comparable to a general sample of US men in this age cohort. Participants were monozygotic and dizygotic twins randomly recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to December 2022.
Measures included subjective memory concern at 4 time points; objective memory, depressive symptoms, and anxiety at the last 3 time points; negative emotionality (trait neuroticism) at age 56 years; polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for neuroticism, depression, and Alzheimer disease; APOE genotype; and parental history of dementia. Primary outcomes were heritability and correlations between subjective memory concern and other measures.
The sample included 1555 male adults examined at age 38 years, 520 at age 56 years (due to late introduction of subjective memory concern questions), 1199 at age 62 years, and 1192 at age 67 years. Phenotypically, subjective memory concerns were relatively stable over time. At age 56 years, subjective memory concern had larger correlations with depressive symptoms (r, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.42), anxiety (r, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.51), and neuroticism (r, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.41) than with objective memory (r, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.13). Phenotypic results were similar at ages 62 and 67 years. A best-fitting autoregressive twin model indicated that genetic influences on subjective memory concern accumulated and persisted over time (h2 = 0.26-0.34 from age 38-67 years). At age 56 years, genetic influences for subjective memory concern were moderately correlated with genetic influences for anxiety (r, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.51), negative emotionality (r, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.44-0.57), and depressive symptoms (r, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.29) as well as objective memory (r, -0.22; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.14). Similar genetic correlations were seen at ages 62 and 67 years. The neuroticism PRS was associated with subjective memory concern at age 38 years (r, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03. to 0.18) and age 67 years (r, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.16). Subjective memory concern was not associated with any Alzheimer disease risk measures.
This cohort study found stable genetic influences underlying subjective memory concern dating back to age 38 years. Subjective memory concern had larger correlations with affect-related measures than with memory-related measures. Improving the utility of subjective memory concern as an indicator of impending cognitive decline and dementia may depend on isolating its statelike component from its traitlike component.",[],JAMA psychiatry,2023-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Bell', 'firstname': 'Tyler R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.'}, {'lastname': 'Beck', 'firstname': 'Asad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of Washington, Seattle.'}, {'lastname': 'Gillespie', 'firstname': 'Nathan A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.'}, {'lastname': 'Reynolds', 'firstname': 'Chandra A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside.'}, {'lastname': 'Elman', 'firstname': 'Jeremy A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'McKenna E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.\nJoint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, San Diego State University/University of California, San Diego.'}, {'lastname': 'Gustavson', 'firstname': 'Daniel E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Behavioral Genetics, University of Colorado Boulder.'}, {'lastname': 'Lyons', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Neale', 'firstname': 'Michael C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.'}, {'lastname': 'Kremen', 'firstname': 'William S', 'initials': 'WS', 'affiliation': 'Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.'}, {'lastname': 'Franz', 'firstname': 'Carol E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.'}]",,,"The sample included 1555 male adults examined at age 38 years, 520 at age 56 years (due to late introduction of subjective memory concern questions), 1199 at age 62 years, and 1192 at age 67 years.

33799518",FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OUTCOMES OF OLDER PATIENTS OPERATED DUE TO HIP FRACTURES.,"Evaluating clinical factors associated with mortality in older patients who underwent surgical correction of hip fractures.
This observational and retrospective study analyzed the medical records of 67 patients (aged older than 60 years), both men and women, who underwent surgical correction of hip fractures from 2019 to 2020 at Hospital São Paulo. The following variables were analyzed: age, sex, presence of comorbidities, affected hip region, and trauma mechanism. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software.
The mean age of patients was 78.12 ± 9.80 years and 80.6% of the sample were women. The prevalence of hip fractures on the right side (52.2%), in the transtrochanteric region (53.7%), and due to fall on the same level (88.1%) was higher. Systemic arterial hypertension (77.6%), diabetes mellitus (37.3%), and dementia (16.4%) were frequent comorbidities. The prevalence of death after fracture was 17.9% and it was associated with longer hospital stay after surgery (p = 0.028).
The prevalence of mortality of patients with hip fractures who underwent surgery was 17.9%. A longer hospital stay due to pre-existing comorbidities was the main factor related to this outcome. 
Avaliar os fatores clínicos associados à mortalidade em pacientes idosos submetidos ao tratamento cirúrgico para correção de fraturas do quadril.
Estudo observacional e retrospectivo de análise de prontuários de 67 pacientes (idade superior a 60 anos). Foram incluídos indivíduos de ambos os sexos, submetidos ao tratamento cirúrgico para correção de fraturas do quadril, entre 2019 e 2020, no Hospital São Paulo. Foram analisadas as variáveis: idade, sexo, presença de comorbidades, região do quadril acometido e mecanismo de trauma. As análises estatísticas foram realizadas pelo software SPSS.
A idade média dos participantes foi de 78,12 ± 9,80 anos, e 80,6% da amostra era constituída por mulheres. Houve maior prevalência de fraturas do quadril no lado direito (52,2%), na região transtrocantérica (53,7%) e causada por queda sem desnível (88,1%). Hipertensão arterial sistêmica (77,6%), diabetes mellitus (37,3%) e demência (16,4%) foram frequentes. A prevalência de óbito após a fratura foi de 17,9%, sendo associada a maior tempo de internação hospitalar após a cirurgia (p = 0,028).
A prevalência de mortalidade dos pacientes com fratura do quadril submetidos à cirurgia foi de 17,9%. O tempo prolongando de internação hospitalar por comorbidades pré-existentes foi o principal fator relacionado a este desfecho.

88,37150183,"Cardiometabolic multimorbidity, lifestyle behaviours, and cognitive function: a multicohort study.","Little is known about the effect of lifestyle factors on cognitive decline related to cardiometabolic multimorbidity. We aimed to examine the association between cardiometabolic multimorbidity and cognitive decline, and the role of lifestyle factors in this association.
We did a pooled multi-cohort study using pooled data from four cohort studies (the Health and Retirement Study; the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing; the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe; and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study) across 14 countries. Eligible participants were age 50 years and older, and those who were missing information on exposure and outcomes, or who had been diagnosed with dementia or Parkinson's disease, were excluded. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was defined as the co-occurrence of two or three cardiometabolic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. The primary outcome of cognitive function was measured in three domains, on the basis of the mean and SD of the corresponding tests: memory, numeracy, and orientation, in all participants with available data. A global cognitive score was created by summing the individual scores.
The final sample consisted of 160 147 individuals across all four studies (73 846 [46·1%] men and 86 301 [53·9%] women) and participants had a mean age of 67·49 years  (SD 10·43). An increasing number of cardiometabolic diseases was dose-dependently associated with the decline in cognitive function score (one disease, β=-0·15 [95% CI -0·17 to -0·13]; two diseases, β=-0·37 [-0·40 to -0·34]; three diseases, β=-0·57 [-0·64 to -0·50]), with comorbid diabetes and stroke (β=-0·23 [-0·29 to -0·17]) contributing most strongly to cardiometabolic disease-associated cognitive decline. Cognitive decline associated with cardiometabolic disease was accelerated with physical inactivity (one cardiometablic disease, p=0·020; two cardiometablic diseases, p=0·42; and three cardiometablic diseases, p=0·24), excessive alcohol use (one cardiometablic disease, p=0·016; two cardiometablic diseases, p=0·65; and three cardiometablic diseases, p=0·50), and the higher number of unhealthy lifestyle factors (one cardiometablic disease, p=0·79; two cardiometablic diseases, p=0·0050; and three cardiometablic diseases, p=0·888).
These findings indicated a targeted approach for simultaneously developing preventative interventions on lifestyles and integrated treatment for cardiometabolic comorbidities to delay cognitive decline in older people.

This cross-sectional study investigated the association between serum lipid levels and the prevalence of cognitive impairment among community-dwelling older adults and explored this difference in association by gender and urban-rural residency.
Participants aged 65 and above in urban and rural areas were recruited between 2018 and 2020, selected from the Hubei Memory and Aging Cohort Study. Detailed neuropsychological evaluations, clinical examinations and laboratory tests were conducted in community health service centres. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the correlation between serum lipid profiles and the prevalence of cognitive impairment.
We identified 1 336 cognitively impaired adults (≥65 years)-1 066 with mild cognitive impairment and 270 with dementia-from 4 746 participants. Triglycerides level was correlated with cognitive impairment in the total sample (χ
There are gender and urban-rural differences in the correlation of serum lipids with cognitive impairment. High triglycerides levels may be a protective factor for cognitive function in older urban men, while high LDL-C levels may be a risk factor for cognitive function in older rural women.","['cognitive dysfunction', 'cross-sectional studies', 'risk factors']",General psychiatry,2023-05-05,"[{'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Yafu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'Pingting', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.\nXiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Guirong', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.\nGeriatric Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.\nGeriatric Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Lang', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.\nGeriatric Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Mengliu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Heng', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Xi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lian', 'firstname': 'Pengfei', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Brain Science and Advanced Technology Institute, Wuhan University of Science and Technology School of Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.\nGeriatric Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}]",,,We identified 1 336 cognitively impaired adults (≥65 years)-1 066 with mild cognitive impairment and 270 with dementia-from 4 746 participants.

The identification of risk factors for malnutrition in elderly individuals must be a priority for governmental organizations worldwide.
A total of 98 institutionalized seniors were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. For the assessment of risk factors, sociodemographic characteristics and health-related information were collected. The Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short-Form test was used to assess malnutrition in the sample population.
A significantly greater proportion of women than men were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. In addition, the comparative analysis revealed that comorbidity, arthritis, balance impairment, dementia and fall episodes with serious injuries were significantly more frequent in the older adults categorized as malnourished or at risk of malnutrition than in those categorized as well-nourished.
Multivariable regression analysis revealed that being female, having a poor cognitive status and experiencing falls with injuries are the main independent factors influencing nutritional status in institutionalized older adults living in a rural area of Portugal.","['Dementia', 'Falls', 'Malnutrition', 'Nursing homes', 'Nutritional status', 'Older adults', 'Portugal']",BMC public health,2023-05-03,"[{'lastname': 'Carrasco', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine/Sciences, University of Extremadura, Avd. de Elvas S/N 06006, Badajoz, Spain. ccarom@unex.es.'}, {'lastname': 'Reis', 'firstname': 'Gorete', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Escola Superior de Enfermagem São João de Deus, Universidade de Évora, Évora, Portugal.\nComprehensive Health Research Center (CHRC), University of Évora, Évora, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Sim-Sim', 'firstname': 'Margarida', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Escola Superior de Enfermagem São João de Deus, Universidade de Évora, Évora, Portugal.\nComprehensive Health Research Center (CHRC), University of Évora, Évora, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Parraca', 'firstname': 'Jose A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Comprehensive Health Research Center (CHRC), University of Évora, Évora, Portugal.\nDepartamento de Desporto E Saúde, Escola de Saúde e Desenvolvimento Humano, Universidade de Évora, Évora, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernandes', 'firstname': 'Orlando', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Comprehensive Health Research Center (CHRC), University of Évora, Évora, Portugal.\nDepartamento de Desporto E Saúde, Escola de Saúde e Desenvolvimento Humano, Universidade de Évora, Évora, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomas-Carus', 'firstname': 'Pablo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Comprehensive Health Research Center (CHRC), University of Évora, Évora, Portugal.\nDepartamento de Desporto E Saúde, Escola de Saúde e Desenvolvimento Humano, Universidade de Évora, Évora, Portugal.'}]",,,"A significantly greater proportion of women than men were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition.

14678749",Sex-dependent effects of acute stress on amyloid-β in male and female mice.,"The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is mediated by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, such as stress, sleep abnormalities and traumatic brain injury. Women are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than men, even when controlling for differences in lifespan. Women are also more likely to report high levels of stress than men. Sex differences in response to stress may play a role in the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in women. In this study, we use in vivo microdialysis to measure levels of Aβ in response to acute stress in male and female mice. We show that Aβ levels are altered differently between female and male mice (APP/PS1 and wild-type) in response to stress, with females showing significantly increased levels of Aβ while most males do not show a significant change. This response is mediated through β-arrestin involvement in Corticotrophin Releasing Factor receptor signalling pathway differences in male and female mice as male mice lacking β-arrestin show increase in Aβ in response to stress similar to females.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'corticotropin releasing factor', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress', 'β-arrestin']",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023-05-02,"[{'lastname': 'Edwards', 'firstname': 'Hannah M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Wallace', 'firstname': 'Clare E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Gardiner', 'firstname': 'Woodrow D', 'initials': 'WD', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Doherty', 'firstname': 'Brookelyn M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Harrigan', 'firstname': 'Ryan T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Yuede', 'firstname': 'Kayla M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Yuede', 'firstname': 'Carla M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cirrito', 'firstname': 'John R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.""}]",,,,"© The Author(s) 2023.

92,37126409,Risk factors for dementia and self-harm: A linkage study.,"People living with dementia experience poor mental health and high rates of self-harm. We investigated risk factors for self-harm in people aged > 40 years living with dementia and risk factors for dementia after self-harm.
Using linked hospital data from New South Wales, Australia, we defined a dementia cohort (n = 154,811) and a self-harm cohort (n = 28,972). Using survival analyses, we investigated predictors of self-harm for the dementia cohort, and predictors of dementia for the self-harm cohort.
We found self-harm or dementia diagnoses occurred most often within 24 months of a dementia diagnosis or initial self-harm presentation, respectively. Men living with dementia, and people with complex psychiatric profiles, had the greatest risk of self-harm. Men who had self-harmed had the greatest risk of dementia diagnoses.
Men and people with complex psychiatric profiles and dementia may particularly benefit from post-diagnosis mental and behavioral support to reduce risk of self-harm.","['dementia', 'hospital admissions', 'linked data', 'mental health', 'self-harm']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2023-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'Adrian R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'The Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Srasuebkul', 'firstname': 'Preeyaporn', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'The Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Trollor', 'firstname': 'Julian N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'The Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nCentre for Healthy Brain Ageing, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wand', 'firstname': 'Anne P F', 'initials': 'APF', 'affiliation': 'Speciality of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia.\nDiscipline of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Draper', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Discipline of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nEastern Suburbs Older Persons Mental Health Service, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cvejic', 'firstname': 'Rachael C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'The Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Moxey', 'firstname': 'Annette', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Dementia Australia, Griffith, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Reppermund', 'firstname': 'Simone', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nCentre for Healthy Brain Ageing, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}]",,,"We found self-harm or dementia diagnoses occurred most often within 24 months of a dementia diagnosis or initial self-harm presentation, respectively.

35456288","Hip fracture incidence and post-fracture mortality in Victoria, Australia: a state-wide cohort study.","Hip fractures are a major public health concern. Number of hip fractures cases increased by 20% from 2012 to 2018. Factors associated with post-fracture mortality included men, those who are frail, living in a non-metropolitan region, or residing in a residential aged care facility. Our results are useful for planning healthcare interventions.
Hip fractures are a major public health concern in Australia. Data on hip fracture incidence and mortality are needed to plan and evaluate healthcare interventions. The aims of the study were to investigate (1) the time-trend in absolute number and incidence of first hip fractures, and (2) factors associated with mortality following first hip fractures in Victoria, Australia.
A state-wide cohort study of all patients aged [Formula: see text] 50 years admitted to a Victorian hospital for first hip fracture between July 2012 and June 2018. Annual age-standardized incidence rates were calculated using population data from Australian Bureau of Statistics. Multivariate negative binomial regression was used to investigate factors associated with post-fracture mortality.
Overall, 31,578 patients had a first hip fracture, of whom two-thirds were women and 47% were [Formula: see text] 85 years old. Absolute annual numbers of first hip fractures increased by 20%. There was no significant change in age- and sex-adjusted incidence. In total, 8% died within 30 days and 25% within 1 year. Factors associated with 30-day mortality included age (≥ 85 years old versus 50-64 years old, mortality rate ratio [MRR] 8.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.86-11.33), men (MRR 2.11, 95% CI 1.88-2.37), higher Hospital Frailty Risk Scores (high frailty versus no frailty, MRR 3.46, 95% CI 2.66-4.50), admission from a residential aged care facility (RACF) (MRR 2.28, 95% CI 1.85-2.82), and residing in a non-metropolitan region (MRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.38). The same factors were associated with 1-year mortality.
The absolute increase in hip fractures highlights the need for interventions to reduce fracture risk, especially for those at higher risk of post-fracture mortality, including men and those who are frail, living in a non-metropolitan region, or residing in a RACF.","['Frailty', 'Hip fracture', 'Incidence', 'Mortality', 'Risk factors']",Archives of osteoporosis,2023-04-29,"[{'lastname': 'Leung', 'firstname': 'Miriam T Y', 'initials': 'MTY', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University (Parkville Campus), 381 Royal Parade, Victoria, 3052, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia. miriam.leung77@monash.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Marquina', 'firstname': 'Clara', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University (Parkville Campus), 381 Royal Parade, Victoria, 3052, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Turner', 'firstname': 'Justin P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University (Parkville Campus), 381 Royal Parade, Victoria, 3052, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.\nFaculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, Québec, Canada.\nCentre de Recherche, Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nFaculty of Pharmacy, Laval University, Québec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ilomaki', 'firstname': 'Jenni', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University (Parkville Campus), 381 Royal Parade, Victoria, 3052, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tran', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacy Department, Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bell', 'firstname': 'J Simon', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University (Parkville Campus), 381 Royal Parade, Victoria, 3052, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.\nFaculty of Health Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.'}]",,"The absolute increase in hip fractures highlights the need for interventions to reduce fracture risk, especially for those at higher risk of post-fracture mortality, including men and those who are frail, living in a non-metropolitan region, or residing in a RACF.","Overall, 31,578 patients had a first hip fracture, of whom two-thirds were women and 47% were [Formula: see text] 85 years old.

94,37116223,Benign prostatic hyperplasia associated with white matter hyperintensities in men.,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) describes common noncancerous prostate enlargement. BPH is usually associated with lower urinary tract symptoms and an increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke and its recurrence. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs), markers of cerebral injury, increase the risk of stroke, cognitive impairment, dementia, and death. The relationship between BPH and WMHs remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between BPH and WMHs.
A total of 788 male patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from July 2019 to September 2021 were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. BPH was assessed by abdominal ultrasound, and three independent neuroradiologists rated the presence or absence of WMHs. Multiple imputations of chained equations were used to handle missing data. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between BPH and WMHs.
Patients with BPH presented an increased risk of WMHs with a crude odds ratio (OR) of 2.76 (95% CI, 2.02-3.79) and an adjusted OR of 1.75 (95% CI, 1.24-2.48) after controlling for potential confounding factors in the multivariate logistic regression.
We found that BPH was closely associated with WMHs in male Chinese individuals.","['Cerebrovascular disease', 'Lower urinary tract symptoms', 'Stroke', 'White matter hyperintensities']",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2023-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Yin', 'firstname': 'Fang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Qi-Da', 'initials': 'QD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gui', 'firstname': 'Teng-Juan', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Ren-Jiao', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xue', 'firstname': 'Qiu-Xia', 'initials': 'QX', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Li-Yun', 'initials': 'LY', 'affiliation': 'Information Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tian', 'firstname': 'Xin-Kui', 'initials': 'XK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Tao', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhe', 'firstname': 'Xing-Wei', 'initials': 'XW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, PR China.

35122938",Gender Difference of Blood Pressure Control Rate and Clinical Prognosis in Patients With Resistant Hypertension: Real-World Observation Study.,"There are several differences in the clinical course of hypertension due to the biological and social differences between men and women. Resistant hypertension is an advanced disease state, and significant gender difference could be expected, but much has not been revealed yet. The purpose of this study was to compare gender differences on the current status of blood pressure (BP) control and clinical prognosis in patients with resistant hypertension.
This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using common data model databases of 3 tertiary hospitals in Korea. Total 4,926 patients with resistant hypertension were selected from January 2017 to December 2018. Occurrence of dialysis, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia or all-cause mortality was followed up for 3 years.
Male patients with resistant hypertension were younger but had a higher cardiovascular risk than female patients. Prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and proteinuria was higher in men than in women. On-treatment diastolic BP was lower in women than in men and target BP achievement rate was higher in women than in men. During 3 years, the incidence of dialysis and myocardial infarction was higher in men, and the incidence of stroke and dementia was higher in women. After adjustment, male sex was an independent risk factor for HF hospitalization, myocardial infarction, and all-cause death.
In resistant hypertension, men were younger than women, but end-organ damage was more common and the risk of cardiovascular event was higher. More intensive cardiovascular prevention strategies may be required in male patients with resistant hypertension.","['Death', 'Heart Failure', 'Hypertension Resistant to Conventional Therapy', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Sex Factors']",Journal of Korean medical science,2023-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Joo', 'firstname': 'Hyung Joon', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Informatics, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\nDivision of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yum', 'firstname': 'Yunjin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yong Hyun', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Son', 'firstname': 'Jung-Woo', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Sung Hea', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Seonghoon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Seongwoo', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hwaseong, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Mi-Seung', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeong', 'firstname': 'Jin-Ok', 'initials': 'JO', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Eung Ju', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea. withnoel@empas.com.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,"In resistant hypertension, men were younger than women, but end-organ damage was more common and the risk of cardiovascular event was higher.

Dementia has a variety of causes, symptoms, and heterogeneity concerning the influence of sex on prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes. The proportion of male-to-female prevalence varies based on the type of dementia. Despite some types of dementia being more common in men, women have a greater lifetime risk of developing dementia. AD is the most common form of dementia in which approximately two-thirds of the affected persons are women. Profound sex and gender differences in physiology and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions have increasingly been identified. As a result, new approaches to dementia diagnosis, care, and patient journeys should be considered. In the heart of a rapidly aging worldwide population, the Women's Brain Project (WBP) was born from the necessity to address the sex and gender gap in AD. WBP is now a well-established international non-profit organization with a global multidisciplinary team of experts studying sex and gender determinants in the brain and mental health. WBP works with different stakeholders worldwide to help change perceptions and reduce sex biases in clinical and preclinical research and policy frameworks. With its strong female leadership, WBP is an example of the importance of female professionals' work in the field of dementia research. WBP-led peer-reviewed papers, articles, books, lectures, and various initiatives in the policy and advocacy space have profoundly impacted the community and driven global discussion. WBP is now in the initial phases of establishing the world's first Sex and Gender Precision Medicine Institute. This review highlights the contributions of the WBP team to the field of AD. This review aims to increase awareness of potentially important aspects of basic science, clinical outcomes, digital health, policy framework and provide the research community with potential challenges and research suggestions to leverage sex and gender differences. Finally, at the end of the review, we briefly touch upon our progress and contribution toward sex and gender inclusion beyond Alzheimer's disease.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Women’s Brain Project', 'artificial intelligence', 'digital therapeutics', 'gender', 'precision medicine', 'sex differences']",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023-04-18,"[{'lastname': 'Castro-Aldrete', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Women's Brain Project, Guntershausen bei Aadorf, Switzerland.""}, {'lastname': 'Moser', 'firstname': 'Michele V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': ""Women's Brain Project, Guntershausen bei Aadorf, Switzerland.""}, {'lastname': 'Putignano', 'firstname': 'Guido', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Women's Brain Project, Guntershausen bei Aadorf, Switzerland.""}, {'lastname': 'Ferretti', 'firstname': 'Maria Teresa', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': ""Women's Brain Project, Guntershausen bei Aadorf, Switzerland.""}, {'lastname': 'Schumacher Dimech', 'firstname': 'Annemarie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Women's Brain Project, Guntershausen bei Aadorf, Switzerland.\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Lucerne, Lucerne, Switzerland.""}, {'lastname': 'Santuccione Chadha', 'firstname': 'Antonella', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Women's Brain Project, Guntershausen bei Aadorf, Switzerland.\nAltoida Inc., Washington, DC, United States.""}]",,,,"Copyright © 2023 Castro-Aldrete, Moser, Putignano, Ferretti, Schumacher Dimech and Santuccione Chadha.","10.3389/fnagi.2023.1105620

25716455",Shared Risk Factors for Depressive Disorder Among Older Adult Couples in Korea.,"Although couples may share many risk factors for depressive disorders in their lifetime, whether these factors mediate the shared risk of depressive disorders has rarely been investigated.
To identify the shared risk factors for depressive disorder in couples and investigate their mediating roles in the shared risk of depressive disorders among older adult couples.
This nationwide, multicenter, community-based cohort study assessed 956 older adults from the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia (KLOSCAD) and a cohort of their spouses (KLOSCAD-S) between January 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021.
Depressive disorders of the KLOSCAD participants.
The mediating roles of shared factors in couples on the association between one spouse's depressive disorder and the other's risk of depressive disorders was examined using structural equation modeling.
A total of 956 KLOSCAD participants (385 women [40.3%] and 571 men [59.7%]; mean [SD] age, 75.1 [5.0] years) and their spouses (571 women [59.7%] and 385 men [40.3%]; mean [SD] age, 73.9 [6.1] years) were included. The depressive disorders of the KLOSCAD participants were associated with an almost 4-fold higher risk of depressive disorders in their spouses in the KLOSCAD-S cohort (odds ratio, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.06-7.19; P < .001). Social-emotional support mediated the association between depressive disorders in the KLOSCAD participants and their spouses' risk of depressive disorders by itself (β = 0.012; 95% CI, 0.001-0.024; P = .04; mediation proportion [MP] = 6.1%) and through chronic illness burden (β = 0.003; 95% CI, 0.000-0.006; P = .04; MP = 1.5%). Chronic medical illness burden (β = 0.025; 95% CI, 0.001-0.050; P = .04; MP = 12.6%) and presence of a cognitive disorder (β = 0.027; 95% CI, 0.003-0.051; P = .03; MP = 13.6%) mediated the association.
The risk factors shared by older adult couples may mediate approximately one-third of the spousal risk of depressive disorders. Identification of and intervention in the shared risk factors of depression among older adult couples may reduce the risk of depressive disorders in the spouses of older adults with depression.",[],JAMA network open,2023-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Ji Won', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Hee Won', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Bae', 'firstname': 'Jong Bin', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Oh', 'firstname': 'Dae Jong', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Workplace Mental Health Institute, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Moon', 'firstname': 'Dong Gyu', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Eunji', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital, Changwon, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Jin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Bong Jo', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Gyeongsang National University, School of Medicine, Jinju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Dong Woo', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jeong Lan', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jhoo', 'firstname': 'Jin Hyeong', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Joon Hyuk', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Jeju National University Hospital, Jeju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jung Jae', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Dankook University Hospital, Cheonan, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwak', 'firstname': 'Kyung Phil', 'initials': 'KP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital, Gyeongju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Seok Bum', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Dankook University Hospital, Cheonan, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Moon', 'firstname': 'Seok Woo', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University and Konkuk University Chungju Hospital, Chungju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryu', 'firstname': 'Seung-Ho', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University and Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Shin Gyeom', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ki Woong', 'initials': 'KW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.\nDepartment of Brain and Cognitive Science, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, South Korea.'}]",,,"A total of 956 KLOSCAD participants (385 women [40.3%] and 571 men [59.7%]; mean [SD] age, 75.1 [5.0] years) and their spouses (571 women [59.7%] and 385 men [40.3%]; mean [SD] age, 73.9 [6.1] years) were included.

20110600",Association of biological sex with clinical outcomes and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.,"The study of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease is increasingly recognized as a key priority in research and clinical development. People with Down syndrome represent the largest population with a genetic link to Alzheimer's disease (>90% in the 7th decade). Yet, sex differences in Alzheimer's disease manifestations have not been fully investigated in these individuals, who are key candidates for preventive clinical trials. In this double-centre, cross-sectional study of 628 adults with Down syndrome [46% female, 44.4 (34.6; 50.7) years], we compared Alzheimer's disease prevalence, as well as cognitive outcomes and AT(N) biomarkers across age and sex. Participants were recruited from a population-based health plan in Barcelona, Spain, and from a convenience sample recruited via services for people with intellectual disabilities in England and Scotland. They underwent assessment with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome, modified cued recall test and determinations of brain amyloidosis (CSF amyloid-β 42 / 40 and amyloid-PET), tau pathology (CSF and plasma phosphorylated-tau181) and neurodegeneration biomarkers (CSF and plasma neurofilament light, total-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and MRI). We used within-group locally estimated scatterplot smoothing models to compare the trajectory of biomarker changes with age in females versus males, as well as by apolipoprotein ɛ4 carriership.

21624928",Prevalence of Possible Dementia in Patients with Maxillofacial Defects and Difficulty of Inserting Obturator in Maxillectomy Patients: Toward Better Provision of Supportive Care.,"As society ages, it is important to understand the prevalence of dementia and the difficulties of inserting prostheses in patients with maxillofacial defects in order to clarify issues in supportive care. We screened 183 patients for dementia using the revised Hasegawa's dementia scale (HDS-R) at the Clinic for Maxillofacial prosthetics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and investigated age and sex differences in HDS-R score. We asked 47 of the 183 participants about the difficulty of inserting a maxillofacial obturator prosthesis and collected subjective comments, information about the prosthesis, and data from five assessments. Multiple regression analysis was used to reveal factors associated with insertion difficulty. Overall, 8.7% of the participants were judged to have possible dementia. Men were more likely than women to have possible dementia, and the risk increased with age. Of the 47 participants, 26 reported difficulty inserting their prosthesis, 12 of whom attributed it to their oral defect. Fourteen patients advised following doctor's instructions to practice insertion in order to become accustomed to it. A lower HDS-R score had a significant impact on insertion difficulty. Cognitive function and difficulty inserting maxillary obturator prostheses should be considered in the provision of continuous supportive care to patients with maxillary defects.","['Hasegawa’s dementia scale', 'defect', 'dementia', 'difficulty of inserting maxillofacial prostheses', 'maxillofacial prosthetics']",Journal of clinical medicine,2023-04-14,"[{'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Hongli', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Advanced Prosthodontics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujita', 'firstname': 'Haruka', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Advanced Prosthodontics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Akiyama', 'firstname': 'Masako', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Advanced Prosthodontics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sumita', 'firstname': 'Yuka I', 'initials': 'YI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Advanced Prosthodontics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wakabayashi', 'firstname': 'Noriyuki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Advanced Prosthodontics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/jcm12072722

27579793",Associations of Change in Body Size With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality Among Healthy Older Adults.,"The association between weight change and subsequent cause-specific mortality among older adults is not well described. The significance of changes in waist circumference (WC) has also not been compared with weight change for this purpose.
To examine the associations of changes in body weight and WC with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
This cohort study is a post hoc analysis of data from the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized clinical trial, which recruited participants between March 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. The study included community-based older adults (16 703 Australian participants aged ≥70 years and 2411 US participants aged ≥65 years) without evident cardiovascular disease (CVD), dementia, physical disability, or life-limiting chronic illness. Data analysis was performed from April to September 2022.
Body weight and WC were measured at baseline and at annual visit 2. Analysis models were adjusted for baseline body mass index because height and weight were measured at baseline, allowing for calculation of body mass index and other variables. Both body weight and WC changes were categorized as change within 5% (stable), decrease by 5% to 10%, decrease by more than 10%, increase by 5% to 10%, and increase by more than 10%.
All-cause, cancer-specific, CVD-specific, and noncancer non-CVD-specific mortality. Mortality events were adjudicated by an expert review panel. Cox proportional hazards regression and competing risk analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.
Among 16 523 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.0 [4.3] years; 9193 women [55.6%]), 1256 deaths were observed over a mean (SD) of 4.4 (1.7) years. Compared with men with stable weight, those with a 5% to 10% weight loss had a 33% higher (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.66) risk of all-cause mortality, and those with more than a 10% decrease in body weight had a 289% higher (HR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.93-5.18) risk. Compared with women with stable weight, those with a 5% to 10% weight loss had a 26% higher (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00-1.60) risk of all-cause mortality, and those with more than a 10% decrease in body weight had a 114% higher (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.58-2.91) risk. Weight loss was associated with a higher cancer-specific mortality (>10% decrease among men: HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.26-5.40; 5%-10% decrease among women: HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.46-2.04; >10% decrease among women: HR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.82-4.26), CVD-specific mortality (>10% decrease among men: HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.63-6.04; >10% decrease among women: HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.05-3.51), and noncancer non-CVD-specific mortality (>10% decrease among men: HR, 4.98; 95% CI, 3.14-7.91). A decrease in WC was also associated with mortality.
This cohort study of healthy older adults suggests that weight loss was associated with an increase in all-cause and cause-specific mortality, including an increased risk of cancer, CVD, and other life-limiting conditions. Physicians should be aware of the significance of weight loss, especially among older men.",[],JAMA network open,2023-04-11,"[{'lastname': 'Hussain', 'firstname': 'Sultana Monira', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Medical Education, Melbourne Medical School, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Newman', 'firstname': 'Anne B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Center for Aging and Population Health, Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.'}, {'lastname': 'Beilin', 'firstname': 'Lawrence J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Royal Perth Hospital, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tonkin', 'firstname': 'Andrew M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Woods', 'firstname': 'Robyn L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Neumann', 'firstname': 'Johannes T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Cardiology, University Heart & Vascular Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.\nGerman Center for Cardiovascular Research, Partner Site Hamburg/Kiel/Lübeck, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Discipline of General Practice, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Carr', 'firstname': 'Prudence R', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Reid', 'firstname': 'Christopher M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Owen', 'firstname': 'Alice', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ball', 'firstname': 'Jocasta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cicuttini', 'firstname': 'Flavia M', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tran', 'firstname': 'Cammie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yuanyuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ernst', 'firstname': 'Michael E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, The University of Iowa, Iowa City.\nDepartment of Family Medicine, Carver College of Medicine, The University of Iowa, Iowa City.'}, {'lastname': 'McNeil', 'firstname': 'John J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}]",,,"Among 16 523 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.0 [4.3] years; 9193 women [55.6%]), 1256 deaths were observed over a mean (SD) of 4.4 (1.7) years.

34515784",Sex Differences in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Reviewing the research presented in this article, it is evident that from an epidemiological perspective, it is important to evaluate the extent to which findings of sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) are due to differences in longevity, survival bias, and comorbidities. Medical, genetic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors, in addition to hormonal factors, can differentially affect the risk and progression of AD in women versus men. Further, evaluation of sex differences in AD progression and the trajectory of change in cognitive function, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood-based biomarkers of AD is needed. Finally, identifying sex differences in AD biomarkers and change across the lifespan is critical for the planning of prevention trials to reduce the risk of developing AD.","['Alzheimer’s dementia', 'Biomarkers', 'Cognitive decline', 'Risk factors', 'Sex differences']",Neurologic clinics,2023-04-09,"[{'lastname': 'Aggarwal', 'firstname': 'Neelum T', 'initials': 'NT', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, 1750 West Harrison Street, Suite 1000, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.

35532912",Association of Early Adulthood Hypertension and Blood Pressure Change With Late-Life Neuroimaging Biomarkers.,"The association between hypertension developed before midlife and late-life brain health is understudied and, because of the cardioprotective benefits of estrogen before menopause, may differ by sex.
To assess the association of early adulthood hypertension and blood pressure (BP) change with late-life neuroimaging biomarkers and examine potential sex differences.
This cohort study used data from the Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans (STAR) and Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) study, which were harmonized longitudinal cohorts of racially and ethnically diverse adults aged 50 years and older from the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento Valley in California. The STAR was conducted from November 6, 2017, to November 5, 2021, and the KHANDLE study was conducted from April 27, 2017, to June 15, 2021. The current study included 427 participants from the KHANDLE and STAR studies who received health assessments between June 1, 1964, and March 31, 1985. Regional brain volumes and white matter (WM) integrity were measured via magnetic resonance imaging between June 1, 2017, and March 1, 2022.
Hypertension status (normotension, transition to hypertension, and hypertension) and BP change (last measure minus first measure) were assessed at 2 multiphasic health checkups (MHCs; 1964-1985) in early adulthood (ages 30-40 years).
Regional brain volumes and WM integrity were measured using 3T magnetic resonance imaging and z standardized. General linear models adjusted for potential confounders (demographic characteristics and study [KHANDLE or STAR]) were used to assess the association of hypertension and BP change with neuroimaging biomarkers. Sex interactions were tested.
Among 427 participants, median (SD) ages were 28.9 (7.3) years at the first MHC, 40.3 (9.4) years at the last MHC, and 74.8 (8.0) years at neuroimaging. A total of 263 participants (61.6%) were female and 231 (54.1%) were Black. Overall, 191 participants (44.7%) had normotension, 68 (15.9%) transitioned to hypertension, and 168 (39.3%) had hypertension. Compared with participants who had normotension, those who had hypertension and those who transitioned to hypertension had smaller cerebral volumes (hypertension: β = -0.26 [95% CI, -0.41 to -0.10]; transition to hypertension: β = -0.23 [95% CI, -0.44 to -0.23]), with similar differences in cerebral gray matter volume (hypertension: β = -0.32 [95% CI, -0.52 to -0.13]; transition to hypertension: β = -0.30 [95% CI, -0.56 to -0.05]), frontal cortex volume (hypertension: β = -0.43 [95% CI, -0.63 to -0.23]; transition to hypertension: β = -0.27 [95% CI, -0.53 to 0]), and parietal cortex volume (hypertension: β = -0.22 [95% CI, -0.42 to -0.02]; transition to hypertension: β = -0.29 [95% CI, -0.56 to -0.02]). Participants with hypertension also had smaller hippocampal volume (β = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.02), greater ventricular volumes (lateral ventricle: β = 0.44 [95% CI, 0.25-0.63]; third ventricle: β = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.01-0.39]), larger free water volume (β = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18-0.52), and lower fractional anisotropy (β = -0.26; 95% CI, -0.45 to -0.08) than those who had normotension. Holding hypertension status constant, a 5-mm Hg increase in systolic BP was associated with smaller temporal cortex volume (β = -0.03; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.01), while a 5-mm Hg increase in diastolic BP was associated with smaller parietal cortex volume (β = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02). The negative association of hypertension and BP change with regional brain volumes appeared stronger in men than women for some regions.
In this cohort study, early adulthood hypertension and BP change were associated with late-life volumetric and WM differences implicated in neurodegeneration and dementia. Sex differences were observed for some brain regions whereby hypertension and increasing BP appeared more detrimental for men. These findings suggest that prevention and treatment of hypertension in early adulthood is important for late-life brain health, particularly among men.",[],JAMA network open,2023-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'George', 'firstname': 'Kristen M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis.'}, {'lastname': 'Maillard', 'firstname': 'Pauline', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilsanz', 'firstname': 'Paola', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Fletcher', 'firstname': 'Evan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento.'}, {'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Rachel L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'School of Public and Community Health Sciences, University of Montana, Missoula.'}, {'lastname': 'Fong', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Mayeda', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth Rose', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Mungas', 'firstname': 'Dan M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Lisa L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'Glymour', 'firstname': 'M Maria', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'DeCarli', 'firstname': 'Charles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento.'}, {'lastname': 'Whitmer', 'firstname': 'Rachel A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento.\nDivision of Research, Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, California.'}]",,,"Among 427 participants, median (SD) ages were 28.9 (7.3) years at the first MHC, 40.3 (9.4) years at the last MHC, and 74.8 (8.0) years at neuroimaging.

27127207","Prevalence of Dementia among Patients Hospitalized with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Spain, 2011-2020: Sex-Related Disparities and Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.","(1) Background: To assess changes in the prevalence of dementia among patients hospitalized with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), to analyze the effects of dementia on in-hospital mortality (IHM) in this population, to evaluate sex differences, and to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these parameters. (2) Methods: We used a nationwide discharge database to select all patients with T2DM aged 60 years or over admitted to Spanish hospitals from 2011 to 2020. We identified those with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD). The effect of sex, age, comorbidity, and COVID-19 on the prevalence of dementia subtypes and on IHM was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. (3) Results: We identified 5,250,810 hospitalizations with T2DM. All-cause dementia was detected in 8.31%, AD in 3.00%, and VaD in 1.55%. The prevalence of all subtypes of dementia increased significantly over time. After multivariable adjustment, higher values were observed in women for all-cause dementia (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.33-1.35), AD (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.58-1.62), and VaD (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.11-1.14). However, female sex was a protective factor for IHM in patients with all-cause dementia (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.89-0.91), AD (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.86-0.91), and VaD (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99). IHM among patients with dementia remained stable over time, until 2020, when it increased significantly. Higher age, greater comorbidity, and COVID-19 were associated with IHM in all dementia subtypes. (4) Conclusions: The prevalence of dementia (all-cause, AD, and VaD) in men and women with T2DM increased over time; however, the IHM remained stable until 2020, when it increased significantly, probably because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of dementia is higher in women than in men, although female sex is a protective factor for IHM.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'COVID-19', 'dementia', 'hospitalization', 'in-hospital mortality', 'sex', 'type 2 diabetes', 'vascular disease']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2023-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Lopez-de-Andres', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Maternal & Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Jimenez-Garcia', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Maternal & Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Zamorano-Leon', 'firstname': 'Jose J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Maternal & Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Omaña-Palanco', 'firstname': 'Ricardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Maternal & Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Carabantes-Alarcon', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Maternal & Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Hernández-Barrera', 'firstname': 'Valentin', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Preventive Medicine and Public Health Teaching and Research Unit, Health Sciences Faculty, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, 28922 Alcorcón, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'De Miguel-Diez', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Respiratory Care Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón (IiSGM), Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28007 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cuadrado-Corrales', 'firstname': 'Natividad', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Maternal & Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph20064923

28641372",Association of Dementia Risk With Focal Epilepsy and Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors.,"Epilepsy has been associated with cognitive impairment and potentially dementia in older individuals. However, the extent to which epilepsy may increase dementia risk, how this compares with other neurological conditions, and how modifiable cardiovascular risk factors may affect this risk remain unclear.
To compare the differential risks of subsequent dementia for focal epilepsy compared with stroke and migraine as well as healthy controls, stratified by cardiovascular risk.
This cross-sectional study is based on data from the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort of more than 500 000 participants aged 38 to 72 years who underwent physiological measurements and cognitive testing and provided biological samples at 1 of 22 centers across the United Kingdom. Participants were eligible for this study if they were without dementia at baseline and had clinical data pertaining to a history of focal epilepsy, stroke, or migraine. The baseline assessment was performed from 2006 to 2010, and participants were followed up until 2021.
Mutually exclusive groups of participants with epilepsy, stroke, and migraine at baseline assessment and controls (who had none of these conditions). Individuals were divided into low, moderate, or high cardiovascular risk groups based on factors that included waist to hip ratio, history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking pack-years.
Incident all-cause dementia; measures of executive function; and brain total hippocampal, gray matter, and white matter hyperintensity volumes.
Of 495 149 participants (225 481 [45.5%] men; mean [SD] age, 57.5 [8.1] years), 3864 had a diagnosis of focal epilepsy only, 6397 had a history of stroke only, and 14 518 had migraine only. Executive function was comparable between participants with epilepsy and stroke and worse than the control and migraine group. Focal epilepsy was associated with a higher risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 4.02; 95% CI, 3.45 to 4.68; P < .001), compared with stroke (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 2.28 to 2.87; P < .001), or migraine (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.21; P = .94). Participants with focal epilepsy and high cardiovascular risk were more than 13 times more likely to develop dementia (HR, 13.66; 95% CI, 10.61 to 17.60; P < .001) compared with controls with low cardiovascular risk. The imaging subsample included 42 353 participants. Focal epilepsy was associated with lower hippocampal volume (mean difference, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.02 to -0.32; t = -2.18; P = .03) and lower total gray matter volume (mean difference, -0.33; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.48; t = -4.29; P < .001) compared with controls. There was no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume (mean difference, 0.10; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.26; t = 1.14; P = .26).
In this study, focal epilepsy was associated with a significant risk of developing dementia, to a greater extent than stroke, which was magnified substantially in individuals with high cardiovascular risk. Further findings suggest that targeting modifiable cardiovascular risk factors may be an effective intervention to reduce dementia risk in individuals with epilepsy.",[],JAMA neurology,2023-03-28,"[{'lastname': 'Tai', 'firstname': 'Xin You', 'initials': 'XY', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Torzillo', 'firstname': 'Emma', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Epilepsy Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Lyall', 'firstname': 'Donald M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Manohar', 'firstname': 'Sanjay', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Husain', 'firstname': 'Masud', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Sen', 'firstname': 'Arjune', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nOxford Epilepsy Research Group, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}]",,,"Of 495 149 participants (225 481 [45.5%] men; mean [SD] age, 57.5 [8.1] years), 3864 had a diagnosis of focal epilepsy only, 6397 had a history of stroke only, and 14 518 had migraine only.

31883973",Associations Between Ambient Air Pollution and Cognitive Abilities from Midlife to Early Old Age: Modification by APOE Genotype.,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measures of ambient air pollution are associated with accelerated age-related cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
We examined associations between air pollution, four cognitive factors, and the moderating role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in the understudied period of midlife.
Participants were ∼1,100 men in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Baseline cognitive assessments were from 2003 to 2007. Measures included past (1993-1999) and recent (3 years prior to baseline assessment) PM2.5 and NO2 exposure, in-person assessment of episodic memory, executive function, verbal fluency, and processing speed, and APOE genotype. Average baseline age was 56 years with a 12-year follow-up. Analyses adjusted for health and lifestyle covariates.
Performance in all cognitive domains declined from age 56 to 68. Higher PM2.5 exposures were associated with worse general verbal fluency. We found significant exposure-by-APOE genotype interactions for specific cognitive domains: PM2.5 with executive function and NO2 with episodic memory. Higher PM2.5 exposure was related to worse executive function in APOE ɛ4 carriers, but not in non-carriers. There were no associations with processing speed.
These results indicate negative effects of ambient air pollution exposure on fluency alongside intriguing differential modifications of cognitive performance by APOE genotype. APOE ɛ4 carriers appeared more sensitive to environmental differences. The process by which air pollution and its interaction with genetic risk for ADRD affects risk for later life cognitive decline or progression to dementia may begin in midlife.","[' PM2.5', 'APOE genotype', 'Aging', 'air pollution', 'cognition', 'midlife', 'nitrogen dioxide']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023-03-28,"[{'lastname': 'Franz', 'firstname': 'Carol E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gustavson', 'firstname': 'Daniel E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Behavior Genetics, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Elman', 'firstname': 'Jeremy A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fennema-Notestine', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.\nDepartment of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagler', 'firstname': 'Donald J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.\nDepartment of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.\nDepartment of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baraff', 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Vietnam Era Twin Registry, VA Puget Sound Health Care, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tu', 'firstname': 'Xin M', 'initials': 'XM', 'affiliation': 'Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health & Human Longevity Science, University of California San Diego, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Tsung-Chin', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health & Human Longevity Science, University of California San Diego, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'De Anda', 'firstname': 'Jaden', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.\nDepartment of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Beck', 'firstname': 'Asad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaufman', 'firstname': 'Joel D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology, Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, and General Internal Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Whitsel', 'firstname': 'Nathan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Finch', 'firstname': 'Caleb E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Jiu-Chiuan', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lyons', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kremen', 'firstname': 'William S', 'initials': 'WS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}]",,These results indicate negative effects of ambient air pollution exposure on fluency alongside intriguing differential modifications of cognitive performance by APOE genotype.

33373413",One-year rehospitalisation and mortality after acute heart failure hospitalisation: a competing risk analysis.,"To identify factors that independently predict the risk of rehospitalisation and death after acute heart failure (AHF) hospital discharge in a real-world setting, considering death without rehospitalisation as a competing event.
Single-centre, retrospective, observational study enrolling 394 patients discharged from an index AHF hospitalisation. Overall survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. For the risk of rehospitalisation, survival analysis considering competing risks was performed: rehospitalisation was the event of interest, and death without rehospitalisation was the competing event.
During the first year after discharge, 131 (33.3%) patients were rehospitalised for AHF and 67 (17.0%) died without being readmitted; the remaining 196 patients (49.7%) lived without further hospitalisations. The 1-year overall survival estimate was 0.71 (SE=0.02). After adjusting for gender, age and left ventricle ejection fraction, the results showed that the risk of death was higher in patients with dementia, higher levels of plasma creatinine (PCr), lower levels of platelet distribution width (PDW) and at Q4 of red cell distribution width (RDW). Multivariable models showed that the risk of rehospitalisation was increased in patients with atrial fibrillation, higher PCr or taking beta-blockers at discharge. Furthermore, the risk of death without AHF rehospitalisation was higher in males, those aged ≥80 years, patients with dementia or RDW at Q4 on admission (compared with Q1).

36070877",The aging brain: risk factors and interventions for long term brain health in women.,"Poor cognitive aging and dementia pose a significant public health burden, and women face unique risks compared to men. Recent research highlights the role of genetics, menopause, chronic disease, and lifestyle in risk and resilience in women's cognitive aging. This work suggests avenues for clinical action at midlife that may change the course of brain health in aging.
Studies indicate women's risk for poor cognitive aging relates in part to hormone changes at menopause, a time when memory, brain structure and function, and Alzheimer's pathology may be observed in women and not men. Medical and lifestyle risks including diabetes, hypertension, and low physical activity also contribute to women's unique risks. At the same time, literature on resilience suggests women may benefit from lifestyle and chronic disease intervention, possibly more than men. Current studies emphasize the importance of interacting genetic and lifestyle risks, and effects of social determinants of health.
Women have greater risk than men for poor cognitive aging; however, by treating the whole person, including genetics, lifestyle, and social environment, clinicians have an opportunity to support healthy cognitive aging in women and reduce the future public health burden of dementia.",[],Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,2023-03-14,"[{'lastname': 'Caldwell', 'firstname': 'Jessica Z K', 'initials': 'JZK', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic, Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, Nevada.'}, {'lastname': 'Isenberg', 'firstname': 'Nancy', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Providence Swedish Center for Healthy Aging, Swedish Neuroscience Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

33067285",Prevalence of suspected dementia in a sample of adults living in Kinshasa-Democratic Republic of the Congo.,"The prevalence of dementia in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in French-speaking countries, has received limited attention. This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors of suspected dementia in elderly adults in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
A community-based sample of 355 individuals over 65 years old was selected using multistage probability sampling in Kinshasa. Participants were screened using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, Alzheimer's Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Individual Fragility Questionnaire, followed by clinical interview and neurological examination. Suspected dementia diagnoses were made based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria including significant cognitive and functional impairments. Prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using, respectively, regression and logistic regression.
Among 355 participants (mean age 74, SD = 7; 51% male), the crude prevalence of suspected dementia was 6.2% (9.0% in women and 3.8% in men). Female sex was a significant factor associated with suspected dementia [OR = 2.81, 95% CI (1.08-7.41)]. The prevalence of dementia increased with age (14.0% after 75 years and 23.1% after 85 years), with age being significantly associated with suspected dementia [OR = 5.42, 95% CI (2.86-10.28)]. Greater education was associated with a lower prevalence of suspected dementia [OR = 2.36, 95% CI (2.14-2.94), comparing those with ≥7.3 years of education to those with <7.3 years of education]. Other factors associated with the prevalence of suspected dementia included being widowed (OR = 1.66, 95% CI (1.05-2.61), being retired or semi-retired (OR = 3.25, 95% CI (1.50-7.03)], a diagnosis of anxiety [OR = 2.56, 95% CI (1.05-6.13)], and death of a spouse or a relative after age 65 [OR = 1.73, 95% CI (1.58-1.92)]. In contrast, depression [OR = 1.92, 95% CI (0.81-4.57)], hypertension [OR = 1.16, 95% CI (0.79-1.71)], body mass index (BMI) [OR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.40-2.79)], and alcohol consumption [OR = 0.83, 95% CI (0.19-3.58)] were not significantly associated with suspected dementia.
This study found a prevalence of suspected dementia in Kinshasa/DRC similar to other developing countries and Central African countries.

23150656",The impact of stroke on the ability to live an independent life at old age: a community-based cohort study of Swedish men.,"Few studies with controls from the same cohort have investigated the impact of stroke on the ability to live an independent life at old age. We aimed to analyze how great an impact being a stroke survivor would have on cognition and disability. We also analyzed the predictive value of baseline cardiovascular risk factors.
We included 1147 men, free from stroke, dementia, and disability, from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men, between 69-74 years of age. Follow-up data were collected between the ages of 85-89 years and were available for 481 of all 509 survivors. Data on stroke diagnosis were obtained through national registries. Dementia was diagnosed through a systematic review of medical charts and in accordance with the current diagnostic criteria. The primary outcome, preserved functions, was a composite outcome comprising four criteria: no dementia, independent in personal activities of daily living, ability to walk outside unassisted, and not living in an institution.
Among 481 survivors with outcome data, 64 (13%) suffered a stroke during the follow-up. Only 31% of stroke cases, compared to 72% of non-stroke cases (adjusted OR 0.20 [95% CI 0.11-0.37]), had preserved functions. The chance of being free of dementia was 60% lower in the stroke group, OR 0.40 [95% CI 0.22-0.72]. No cardiovascular risk factors were independently able to predict preserved functions among stroke cases.

26569028","Incidence of cognitive impairment after hypothetical interventions on depression, nighttime sleep duration, and leisure activity engagement among older Chinese adults: An application of the parametric g-formula.","Cognitive impairment is an age-relevant intermediate stage where cognition declines to a state between the normal aging process and dementia. Earlier studies reported that depression, inappropriate nighttime sleep duration (NSD), and limited leisure activity engagement are cognitive impairment risk factors among older adults. Thus, we postulated that interventions on depression, sleep duration, and leisure activity engagement can reduce cognitive impairment risk. However, no earlier research ever explored this.
The data of 4,819 respondents aged 60 years and above, without cognitive impairment at baseline and with no prior history of memory-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and encephalatrophy, were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) between 2011 and 2018. The parametric g-formula, an analytic tool for estimating standardized outcome distributions using covariate (exposure and confounders)-specific estimates of the outcome distribution, was used to estimate 7-year cumulative cognitive impairment risks among older Chinese adults, under independent hypothetical interventions on depression, NSD, and leisure activity engagement, which was subdivided into social activity (SA) and intellectual activity (IA) for the different intervention combinations.
The observed cognitive impairment risk was 37.52%. Independent intervention on IA was the most effective factor in reducing incident cognitive impairment, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.82), followed by depression (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85-0.93) and NSD (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95). The joint intervention combining depression, NSD, and IA interventions could reduce the risk by 17.11%, with an RR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.48-0.65). In subgroup analyses, independent interventions on depression and IA had analogously significant effects on men and women. However, interventions on depression and IA had stronger effects on literate than illiterate individuals.
Hypothetical interventions on depression, NSD, and IA reduced cognitive impairment risks among older Chinese adults, both independently and jointly. The findings of the present study suggest that the intervention measures on depression, inappropriate NSD, limited intellectual activities, and their combination may prove to be effective strategies for preventing cognitive impairment among older adults.","['cognitive impairment', 'depression', 'g-formula', 'leisure activity', 'older adults', 'sleep duration']",Frontiers in public health,2023-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Nan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Nursing, School of Nursing, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Fenghui', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine Nursing, School of Nursing, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Cui', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Science, School of Nursing, Peking University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'Ping', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Nursing, School of Nursing, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China.'}]",,,"The observed cognitive impairment risk was 37.52%.

35287171","Incidence, Clinical Correlates, and Prognostic Impact of Dementia in Heart Failure: A Population-Based Cohort Study.","Heart failure (HF) may increase the risk of dementia via shared risk factors.
The authors investigated the incidence, types, clinical correlates, and prognostic impact of dementia in a population-based cohort of patients with index HF.
The previously territory-wide database was interrogated to identify eligible patients with HF (N = 202,121) from 1995 to 2018. Clinical correlates of incident dementia and their associations with all-cause mortality were assessed using multivariable Cox/competing risk regression models where appropriate.
Among a total cohort aged ≥18 years with HF (mean age 75.3 ± 13.0 years, 51.3% women, median follow-up 4.1 [IQR: 1.2-10.2] years), new-onset dementia occurred in 22,145 (11.0%), with age-standardized incidence rate of 1,297 (95% CI: 1,276-1,318) per 10,000 in women and 744 (723-765) per 10,000 in men. Types of dementia were Alzheimer's disease (26.8%), vascular dementia (18.1%), and unspecified dementia (55.1%). Independent predictors of dementia included: older age (≥75 years, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]: 2.22), female sex (SHR: 1.31), Parkinson's disease (SHR: 1.28), peripheral vascular disease (SHR: 1.46), stroke (SHR: 1.24), anemia (SHR: 1.11), and hypertension (SHR: 1.21). The population attributable risk was highest for age ≥75 years (17.4%) and female sex (10.2%). New-onset dementia was independently associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted SHR: 4.51; 
New-onset dementia affected more than 1 in 10 patients with index HF over the follow-up, and portended a worse prognosis in these patients. Older women were at highest risk and should be targeted for screening and preventive strategies.","['AD, Alzheimer’s disease', 'CDARS, Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System', 'CVD, cardiovascular death', 'HF, heart failure', 'ICD, International Classification of Diseases', 'PAF, population attributable fractions', 'SHR, subdistribution hazard ratio', 'VD, vascular dementia', 'clinical correlates', 'dementia', 'heart failure', 'mortality', 'sex differ']",JACC.

28502043",The link between static and dynamic brain functional network connectivity and genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphic alleles are genetic factors associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Although previous studies have explored the link between AD genetic risk and static functional network connectivity (sFNC), to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the association between dynamic FNC (dFNC) and AD genetic risk. Here, we examined the link between sFNC, dFNC, and AD genetic risk with a data-driven approach. We used rs-fMRI, demographic, and APOE data from cognitively normal individuals (N = 886) between 42 and 95 years of age (mean = 70 years). We separated individuals into low, moderate, and high-risk groups. Using Pearson correlation, we calculated sFNC across seven brain networks. We also calculated dFNC with a sliding window and Pearson correlation. The dFNC windows were partitioned into three distinct states with k-means clustering. Next, we calculated the proportion of time each subject spent in each state, called occupancy rate or OCR and frequency of visits. We compared both sFNC and dFNC features across individuals with different genetic risks and found that both sFNC and dFNC are related to AD genetic risk. We found that higher AD risk reduces within-visual sensory network (VSN) sFNC and that individuals with higher AD risk spend more time in a state with lower within-VSN dFNC. We also found that AD genetic risk affects whole-brain sFNC and dFNC in women but not men. In conclusion, we presented novel insights into the links between sFNC, dFNC, and AD genetic risk.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Dynamic functional network connectivity sex difference', 'Genetic risk resting-state fMRI static functional network connectivity']",NeuroImage.

113,36863290,Dietary diversity and risk of late-life disabling dementia in middle-aged and older adults.,"A balanced diet integrating several foods and nutrients may promote the maintenance of brain function. Previous studies have substantiated the above hypothesis in the regional population in Japan. This study aimed to investigate the potential effect of dietary diversity on the risk of disabling dementia in a nationwide large-scale cohort of the Japanese population.
A total of 38,797 participants (17,708 men and 21,089 women) aged 45-74 years were followed up for a median of 11.0 years. The daily frequencies of the consumption of each of the 133 food and beverage items listed on a food frequency questionnaire (excluding ﬁve alcoholic beverages) were measured. The dietary diversity score was calculated as the number of food items consumed per day. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) of the dietary diversity score quintile groups.
We documented 4302 participants with disabling dementia (11.1%) during the follow-up period. Among women, the dietary diversity score was inversely associated with disabling dementia (highest quintile HR [with the lowest quintile as the reference]: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.56-0.78; Q1-Q5 p for trend <0.001), but this was not true among men (highest quintile HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.87-1.29; Q1-Q5 p for trend = 0.415). These results did not change substantially when using disabling dementia with stroke as the outcome; the association remained significant among women but was absent among men.

17690555",Associations between parenthood and dementia in men and women: biology or confounding?,"High parity and extremes of age at first birth have been linked with increased dementia risk in women, with exposure to pregnancy-associated physiological changes proposed as an explanation. However, confounding by socioeconomic and lifestyle factors could also produce such associations, whereby men would share similar patterns of association. We investigated whether these associations hold for both sexes.
In a cohort study including all women (N = 2,222,638) and men (N = 2,141,002) ≥ 40 years of age in 1994-2017 in Denmark, we used Cox regression to evaluate associations between number of children, age at first birth, and dementia risk separately for women and men.
During follow-up, 81,413 women and 53,568 men (median age at diagnosis, 83.3 and 80.3 years, respectively) developed dementia. Compared with having one child, having two or more children was associated with modest decreases in overall dementia risk in both sexes (hazard ratio [HR] range 0.82-0.91, P

31512501",Impact of interventions scenarios targeting three main vascular risk factors on the future burden of dementia in France.,"The epidemiological and societal burden of dementia is expected to increase in the coming decades due to the world population aging. In this context, the evaluation of the potential impact of intervention scenarios aiming at reducing the prevalence of dementia risk factors is an active area of research. However, such studies must account for the associated changes in mortality and the dependence between the risk factors. Using micro-simulations, this study aims to estimate the changes in dementia burden in France in 2040 according to intervention scenarios targeting the prevention or treatment of hypertension, diabetes and physical inactivity. Accounting for their communality and their effects on mortality, the results show that the disappearance of hypertension, diabetes and physical inactivity in France in 2020 could decrease dementia prevalence by 33% among men and 26% among women in 2040 and increase the life expectancy without dementia at age 65 by 3.4 years (men) and 2.6 years (women). Among the three factors, the prevention of hypertension would be the most efficient. These projections rely on current estimates of the risk of dementia and death associated with risk factors. Thanks to the R package developed they could be refined for different countries or different interventions and updated with new estimates.","['Dementia', 'Diabetes', 'Disease burden', 'Hypertension', 'Micro-simulation', 'Physical inactivity', 'Projections']",European journal of epidemiology,2023-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Jacqmin-Gadda', 'firstname': 'Hélène', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Bordeaux Population Health Research Center U1219, Inserm, Univ.

25365922",Adiposity impacts cognitive function in Asian populations: an epidemiological and Mendelian Randomization study.,"Obesity and related metabolic disturbances including diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia predict future cognitive decline. Asia has a high prevalence of both obesity and metabolic disease, potentially amplifying the future burden of dementia in the region. We aimed to investigate the impact of adiposity and metabolic risk on cognitive function in Asian populations, using an epidemiological analysis and a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study.
The Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS) Study is a population-based cohort of South-East-Asian men and women in Singapore, aged 30-84 years. We analyzed 8769 participants with metabolic and cognitive data collected between 2018 and 2021. Whole-body fat mass was quantified with Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). Cognition was assessed using a computerized cognitive battery. An index of general cognition ' 
Participants were 58.9% female, and aged 51.4 (11.3) years. In univariate analysis, all 29 adiposity and metabolic measures assessed were associated with ' 
We show an independent relationship between adiposity and cognition in a multi-ethnic Asian population. MR analyses suggest that both visceral adiposity and raised BMI are likely to be causally linked to cognition. Our findings have important implications for preservation of cognitive health, including further motivation for action to reverse the rising burden of obesity in the Asia-Pacific region.

To quantify the associations between levels of cardiovascular health (CVH), estimated by the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) metrics, with life expectancy free of major chronic disease, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancer, and dementia, in UK adults.
This cohort study included 135 199 adults in the UK Biobank study who were initially free of major chronic disease and had complete data on LE8 metrics. Data analyses were performed in August 2022.
Cardiovascular health levels, as estimated by LE8 score. The LE8 score, which consists of 8 components: (1) diet, (2) physical activity, (3) tobacco/nicotine exposure, (4) sleep, (5) body mass index, (6) non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (7) blood glucose, and (8) blood pressure. The CVH level was evaluated at baseline and categorized into low (LE8 score <50), moderate (LE8 score ≥50 but <80), and high (LE8 score ≥80) levels.
The primary outcome was the life expectancy free of 4 major chronic diseases (CVD, diabetes, cancer, and dementia).
Of the 135 199 adults (44.7% men; mean [SD] age, 55.4 [7.9] years) included in the study, a total of 4712, 48 955, and 6748 men had low, moderate, and high CVH levels, respectively, and the corresponding numbers for women were 3661, 52 192, and 18 931. At age 50 years, the estimated disease-free years were 21.5 (95% CI, 21.0-22.0), 25.5 (95% CI, 25.4-25.6), and 28.4 (95% CI, 27.8-29.0) for men with low, moderate, and high CVH levels, respectively; the corresponding estimated disease-free years at age 50 years for women were 24.2 (95% CI, 23.5-24.8), 30.5 (95% CI, 30.4-30.6), and 33.6 (95% CI, 33.1-34.0). Equivalently, men with moderate or high CVH levels lived on average 4.0 (95% CI, 3.4-4.5) or 6.9 (95% CI, 6.1-7.7) longer years free of chronic disease, respectively, at age 50 years, compared with men with low CVH levels. The corresponding longer years lived free of disease for women were 6.3 (95% CI, 5.6-7.0) or 9.4 (95% CI, 8.5-10.2). For participants with high CVH level, there was not a statistically significant difference in disease-free life expectancy between participants with low and other socioeconomic status.
In this cohort study, a high level of CVH, evaluated using the LE8 metrics, was associated with longer life expectancy free of major chronic diseases and may contribute to narrowing socioeconomic health inequalities in both men and women.",[],JAMA internal medicine,2023-02-28,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xuan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana.'}, {'lastname': 'Heianza', 'firstname': 'Yoriko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana.'}, {'lastname': 'Manson', 'firstname': 'JoAnn E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': ""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

118,36842691,Would surgical Apgar score be useful to predict postoperative complications after proximal femoral fracture surgery? - A retrospective cohort study.,"The surgical Apgar score (SAS) is a perioperative risk evaluation score, which considers intraoperative minimum heart rate, minimum mean arterial pressure and estimated blood loss. Although validated in multiple surgical fields, SAS remains quite controversial in the orthopedic one. The main purpose of this study was to investigate if SAS relates with the occurrence of complications during the first 30-days after proximal femoral fracture surgery.
Retrospective study including all consecutive patients submitted to proximal femoral fracture surgery between January and July 2019. Patients with no information about SAS were excluded. Patients were divided in two groups, based on the occurrence of complications during the first 30 post-operative days and their SAS calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess SAS power as a predictive model of complications.
Forty-two percent (n = 76) of the 181 patients included in the study developed complications during the first 30 postoperative days. Eight patients (4,4%) died during that period. The patient's mean age was 79 years and 30,9% (n = 56) were men. Heart failure, pacemaker use, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia were significantly associated with post-operative morbidity. There was no significant correlation between SAS and the occurrence of complications during the first 30 postoperative days. The AUC of SAS as a predictive model for postoperative complications after proximal femoral fracture surgery was 0,522, being insufficient to be considered an accepted model of prediction.
Based on this study, we conclude that SAS is not predictive of the development of complications in the first 30 post-operative days in patients submitted to proximal femoral fracture surgery. However, other clinical factors have been identified as associated with postoperative morbidity. In the future, prospective-based studies with higher samples may better clarify the role of SAS in this context.","['Apgar quirúrgico', 'Fractura femoral proximal', 'Morbilidad postoperatoria', 'Perioperative risk', 'Postoperative morbidity', 'Proximal femur fracture', 'Riesgo perioperatorio', 'Surgical Apgar score']",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,2023-02-27,"[{'lastname': 'Sá E Silva', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto, Porto, Portugal.

31430566","Longitudinal study of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, allostatic load, and cognition among memory clinic patients.","Allostatic load (AL) is defined as the cumulative dysregulation of neuroendocrine, immunological, metabolic, and cardiovascular systems that increases the susceptibility to stress-related health problems. Several dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors have been identified, yet little is known about the role of AL and its associations with AD biomarkers (e.g., beta-amyloid (Aβ) or tau) and cognitive function among memory clinic patients. Hence, this study aims to assess the association between AL and AD biomarkers, cognitive performance, and cognitive decline after 3-years of follow-up.
Data from 188 memory clinic patients were derived from the Cortisol and Stress in AD (Co-STAR) study in Sweden. Participants underwent baseline assessments including blood tests for AL measures (including cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, cobalamin, homocysteine, leukocytes, glycated hemoglobin, albumin, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatinine), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling for AD biomarkers and neuropsychological tests including five cognitive domains. Linear regressions were conducted, adjusting for age, sex, and education.
Higher AL was associated with lower CSF Aβ1-42 levels (
This study showed that higher AL was associated with increased brain amyloid accumulation. This suggests that AL may play a role in AD/dementia pathophysiology. Potential sex-related differences should be assessed in further larger studies.","['AD biomarkers', 'Allostatic load', 'Chronic stress', 'Cognition', 'Memory clinic']","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2023-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Adedeji', 'firstname': 'Dickson O', 'initials': 'DO', 'affiliation': 'Psychiatric Clinic, Vrinnevi Hospital, Norrköping, Sweden.\nDivision of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Holleman', 'firstname': 'Jasper', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Juster', 'firstname': 'Robert-Paul', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Addiction, University of Montreal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Udeh-Momoh', 'firstname': 'Chinedu T', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nAgeing Epidemiology Research Unit (AGE), School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kåreholt', 'firstname': 'Ingemar', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nInstitute of Gerontology, School of Health and Welfare, Aging Research Network - Jönköping (ARN-J), Jönköping University, Jönköping, Sweden.\nAging Research Center, Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagman', 'firstname': 'Göran', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nTheme Inflammation and Aging, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Aspö', 'firstname': 'Malin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nTheme Inflammation and Aging, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Adagunodo', 'firstname': 'Sofia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Memory Clinic Zentralschweiz, Luzerner Psychiatrie, Lucerne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Håkansson', 'firstname': 'Krister', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kivipelto', 'firstname': 'Miia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nAgeing Epidemiology Research Unit (AGE), School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, UK.\nTheme Inflammation and Aging, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\nInstitute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Solomon', 'firstname': 'Alina', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nAgeing Epidemiology Research Unit (AGE), School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, UK.\nTheme Inflammation and Aging, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, Neurology, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sindi', 'firstname': 'Shireen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nAgeing Epidemiology Research Unit (AGE), School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, UK.'}]",,This study showed that higher AL was associated with increased brain amyloid accumulation.

30806901","Sex-specific associations between diabetes and dementia: the role of age at onset of disease, insulin use and complications.","Whether the association of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with dementia was differed by sex remains unclear, and the roles of age at onset of disease, insulin use and diabetes' complications in their association are unknown.
This study analyzed data of 447 931 participants from the UK Biobank. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and women-to-men ratio of HRs (RHR) for the association between T2DM and incident dementia [all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD)]. The roles of age at onset of disease, insulin use and diabetes' complications in their association were also analyzed.
Compared to people with no diabetes at all, people with T2DM had increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR 2.85, 95% CI 2.56-3.17). The HRs between T2DM and AD were higher in women than men, with an RHR (95%CI) of 1.56 (1.20, 2.02). There was a trend that people who experienced T2DM before age 55 had higher risk of VD than those who had T2DM after age 55. In addition, there was a trend that T2DM had higher effect on VD that occurred before age 75 years than events that occurred after age 75. Patients with T2DM using insulin had higher risk of all-cause dementia than those without insulin, with an RHR (95%CI) of 1.54 (1.00-2.37). People with complications had doubled risk of all-cause dementia, AD and VD.
Adopting a sex-sensitive strategy to address the risk of dementia in patients with T2DM is instrumental for a precision medicine approach. Meanwhile, it is warranted to consider patients' age at onset of T2DM, insulin use status and complications conditions.","['Age at onset of diabetes', 'Complications', 'Dementia', 'Insulin use', 'Sex', 'Type 2 diabetes']",Biology of sex differences,2023-02-22,"[{'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Chunmiao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Caiyun', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Ziwei', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hao', 'firstname': 'Wenting', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, , Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\nNHC Key Lab of Health Economics and Policy Research (Shandong University), Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Chunying', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Huizi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Dongshan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. dongshan.zhu@uq.net.au.'}]",,,"Compared to people with no diabetes at all, people with T2DM had increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR 2.85, 95% CI 2.56-3.17).

23926208",Association Between Triglycerides and Incident Cognitive Impairment in Black and White Adults in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study.,"Background Elevated nonfasting triglycerides were associated with non-Alzheimer dementia in a recent study. However, this study neither evaluated the association of fasting triglycerides with incident cognitive impairment (ICI) nor adjusted for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), known risk markers for ICI and dementia. Methods and Results We examined the association between fasting triglycerides and ICI among 16 170 participants in the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study without cognitive impairment or a history of stroke at baseline in 2003 to 2007 and who had no stroke events during follow-up through September 2018. Overall, 1151 participants developed ICI during the median follow-up of 9.6 years. The relative risk for ICI associated with fasting triglycerides of ≥150 mg/dL versus <100 mg/dL including adjustment for age and geographic region of residence was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.20-2.11) among White women and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.00-1.62) among Black women. After multivariable adjustment, including adjustment for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hs-CRP, the relative risk for ICI associated with fasting triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL versus <100 mg/dL was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.09-2.06) among White women and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.93-1.57) among Black women. There was no evidence of an association between triglycerides and ICI among White or Black men. Conclusions Elevated fasting triglycerides were associated with ICI in White women after full adjustment including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hs-CRP. The current results suggest that the association between triglycerides and ICI is stronger in women than men.","['cognitive impairment', 'dementia', 'high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol', 'triglycerides']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2023-02-22,"[{'lastname': 'Rosenson', 'firstname': 'Robert S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY.'}, {'lastname': 'Cushman', 'firstname': 'Mary', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine University of Vermont Colchester VT.'}, {'lastname': 'McKinley', 'firstname': 'Emily C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health University of Alabama at Birmingham Birmingham AL.'}, {'lastname': 'Muntner', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health University of Alabama at Birmingham Birmingham AL.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhixin', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health University of Alabama at Birmingham Birmingham AL.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaisar', 'firstname': 'Tomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine University of Washington Seattle WA.'}, {'lastname': 'Heinecke', 'firstname': 'Jay', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine University of Washington Seattle WA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tangney', 'firstname': 'Christy', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Clinical Nutrition and Preventive Medicine Rush University and Medical Center Chicago IL.'}, {'lastname': 'Judd', 'firstname': 'Suzanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health University of Alabama at Birmingham Birmingham AL.'}, {'lastname': 'Colantonio', 'firstname': 'Lisandro D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health University of Alabama at Birmingham Birmingham AL.'}]",,,,,"10.1161/JAHA.122.026833

16019633",Evaluation of Cognitive Functioning Before and After Cochlear Implantation in Adults Aged 55 Years and Older at Risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Given the rapidly rising dementia incidence, management of modifiable risk factors, such as hearing loss, is vital. Multiple studies have demonstrated an improvement of cognitive functioning in older adults with severe hearing loss after cochlear implantation; however, few of these studies, to the authors' knowledge, specifically analyzed participants achieving poor cognitive results preoperatively.
To evaluate the cognitive functioning of older adults with severe hearing loss at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) before and after cochlear implantation.
This prospective, longitudinal cohort study performed at a single center reports data obtained over a 6-year period (April 2015 to September 2021) of an ongoing prospective, longitudinal cohort study on cochlear implant outcomes in older adults. A consecutive sample of older adults with severe hearing loss eligible for cochlear implantation was included. All participants obtained a Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for hearing-impaired patients (RBANS-H) total score indicative of MCI preoperatively. Participants were assessed before cochlear implant activation and 12 months after cochlear implant activation.
The intervention consisted of cochlear implantation.
The primary outcome measure was cognition, measured by the RBANS-H.
A total of 21 older adult cochlear implant candidates were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 72 [9] years; 13 [62%] men). Cochlear implantation was associated with an improvement of overall cognitive functioning 12 months after activation (median [IQR] percentile, 5 [2-8] vs 12 [7-19]; difference, 7 [95% CI, 2-12]). Eight participants (38%) surpassed the MCI cutoff (16th percentile) postoperatively, while the overall median cognitive score remained under this cutoff. In addition, participants' speech recognition in noise improved, with a lower score indicating improvement (mean [SD] score, +17.16 [5.45] vs +5.67 [6.3]; difference, -11.49 [95% CI, -14.26 to -8.72]), after cochlear implant activation. Improvement of speech recognition in noise was positively associated with improvement in cognitive functioning (rs, -0.48 [95% CI, -0.69 to -0.19]). Years of education, sex, RBANS-H version, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were not related to the evolution in RBANS-H scores.
In this prospective, longitudinal cohort study, cognitive functioning and speech perception in noise showed a clinically meaningful improvement 12 months after cochlear implant activation in older adults with severe hearing loss at risk for MCI, suggesting that cochlear implantation is not contraindicated in cochlear implant candidates with cognitive decline and should be considered after multidisciplinary evaluation.",[],JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,2023-02-17,"[{'lastname': 'Andries', 'firstname': 'Ellen', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital (UZA), Edegem, Belgium.\nExperimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Bosmans', 'firstname': 'Joyce', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Engelborghs', 'firstname': 'Sebastiaan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel and Center for Neurosciences (C4N), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences and Institute Born-Bunge, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Cras', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Experimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.\nDepartment of Neurology, Antwerp University Hospital (UZA), Edegem, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Vanderveken', 'firstname': 'Olivier M', 'initials': 'OM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital (UZA), Edegem, Belgium.\nExperimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Lammers', 'firstname': 'Marc J W', 'initials': 'MJW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital (UZA), Edegem, Belgium.\nExperimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van de Heyning', 'firstname': 'Paul H', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital (UZA), Edegem, Belgium.\nExperimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Rompaey', 'firstname': 'Vincent', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital (UZA), Edegem, Belgium.\nExperimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Mertens', 'firstname': 'Griet', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital (UZA), Edegem, Belgium.\nExperimental Laboratory of Translational Neurosciences and Dento-Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp (UA), Antwerp, Belgium.'}]",,,"A total of 21 older adult cochlear implant candidates were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 72 [9] years; 13 [62%] men).

123,36790027,Sex differences in dementia risk and risk factors: Individual-participant data analysis using 21 cohorts across six continents from the COSMIC consortium.,"Sex differences in dementia risk, and risk factor (RF) associations with dementia, remain uncertain across diverse ethno-regional groups.
A total of 29,850 participants (58% women) from 21 cohorts across six continents were included in an individual participant data meta-analysis. Sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs), and women-to-men ratio of hazard ratios (RHRs) for associations between RFs and all-cause dementia were derived from mixed-effect Cox models.
Incident dementia occurred in 2089 (66% women) participants over 4.6 years (median). Women had higher dementia risk (HR, 1.12 [1.02, 1.23]) than men, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income economies. Associations between longer education and former alcohol use with dementia risk (RHR, 1.01 [1.00, 1.03] per year, and 0.55 [0.38, 0.79], respectively) were stronger for men than women; otherwise, there were no discernible sex differences in other RFs.
Dementia risk was higher in women than men, with possible variations by country-level income settings, but most RFs appear to work similarly in women and men.","['data harmonization', 'dementia', 'diversity', 'risk factor', 'sex difference']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2023-02-16,"[{'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Lipnicki', 'firstname': 'Darren M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), Discipline of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Castro-Costa', 'firstname': 'Erico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Center for Studies in Public Health and Aging Rene Rachou Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lima-Costa', 'firstname': 'Maria Fernanda', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Center for Studies in Public Health and Aging Rene Rachou Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Diniz', 'firstname': 'Breno S', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': 'UConn Center on Aging, Department of Psychiatry, School\xa0of Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Xiao', 'firstname': 'Shifu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Shanghai Mental Health Centre, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lipton', 'firstname': 'Richard B', 'initials': 'RB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Katz', 'firstname': 'Mindy J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Cuiling', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Community Heath, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Preux', 'firstname': 'Pierre-Marie', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Inserm U1094, IRD U270, Univ.

32037688",Effects of sex and APOE ε4 genotype on brain mitochondrial high-energy phosphates in midlife individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease: A 31Phosphorus MR spectroscopy study.,"Age, female sex, and APOE epsilon 4 (APOE4) genotype are the three greatest risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The convergence of these risks creates a hypometabolic AD-risk profile unique to women, which may help explain their higher lifetime risk of AD. Less is known about APOE4 effects in men, although APOE4 positive men also experience an increased AD risk. This study uses 31Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS) to examine effects of sex and APOE4 status on brain high-energy phosphates [adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi)] and membrane phospholipids [phosphomonoesters (PME), phosphodiesters (PDE)] in 209 cognitively normal individuals at risk for AD, ages 40-65, 80% female, 46% APOE4 carriers (APOE4+). Women exhibited lower PCr/ATP and PCr/Pi levels than men in AD-vulnerable regions, including frontal, posterior cingulate, lateral and medial temporal cortex (multi-variable adjusted p≤0.037). The APOE4+ group exhibited lower PCr/ATP and PCr/Pi in frontal regions as compared to non-carriers (APOE4-) (multi-variable adjusted p≤0.005). Sex by APOE4 status interactions were observed in frontal regions (multi-variable adjusted p≤0.046), where both female groups and APOE4+ men exhibited lower PCr/ATP and PCr/Pi than APOE4- men. Among men, APOE4 homozygotes exhibited lower frontal PCr/ATP than heterozygotes and non-carriers. There were no significant effects of sex or APOE4 status on Pi/ATP and PME/PDE measures. Among midlife individuals at risk for AD, women exhibit lower PCr/ATP (e.g. higher ATP utilization) and lower PCr/Pi (e.g. higher energy demand) than age-controlled men, independent of APOE4 status. However, a double dose of APOE4 allele shifted men's brains to a similar metabolic range as women's brains. Examination of brain metabolic heterogeneity can support identification of AD-specific pathways within at-risk subgroups, further advancing both preventive and precision medicine for AD.",[],PloS one,2023-02-15,"[{'lastname': 'Jett', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Dyke', 'firstname': 'Jonathan P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Boneu Yepez', 'firstname': 'Camila', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Zarate', 'firstname': 'Camila', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlton', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Schelbaum', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Jang', 'firstname': 'Grace', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Pahlajani', 'firstname': 'Silky', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.\nDepartment of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Schantel', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Diaz Brinton', 'firstname': 'Roberta', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Mosconi', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.\nDepartment of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.'}]",,,,"Copyright: © 2023 Jett et al.

3798914",State-Level Indicators of Childhood Educational Quality and Incident Dementia in Older Black and White Adults.,"Higher educational attainment is associated with reduced dementia risk, but the role of educational quality is understudied, presenting a major evidence gap, especially as it may contribute to racial inequities.
To evaluate the association between state-level educational quality during childhood and dementia risk.
This cohort study analyzed longitudinal data collected from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2019 (23-year follow-up period). The sample comprised members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care delivery system, who completed an optional survey during 1964-1972. Eligible individuals were US born; non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White; aged 65 years or older as of January 1, 1996; were still alive; and did not have a dementia diagnosis or lapse in KPNC membership greater than 90 days between January 1 and December 31, 1996.
Historical state-level administrative indicators of school quality (school term length, student-teacher ratio, and attendance rates) linked to participants using birth state and birth year (with a 6-year lag) and divided into tertiles using the pooled sample.
Dementia diagnoses from electronic health records between 1997 and 2019 were analyzed between March 1 and August 31, 2022. The associations of educational quality with incident dementia were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
Among 21 450 KPNC members who participated in the optional survey, individuals born before availability of educational quality records (n = 87) and missing educational attainment (n = 585) were excluded. The final analytic sample was 20 778 individuals (56.5% women, 43.5% men; mean [SD] age, 74.7 [6.5] years; 18.8% Black; 81.2% White; 41.0% with less than high school education). Among Black individuals, 76.2% to 86.1% (vs 20.8%-23.3% of White individuals) attended schools in states in the lowest educational quality tertiles. Highest (vs lowest) educational quality tertiles were associated with lower dementia risk (student-teacher ratio: hazard ratio [HR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.83-0.94]; attendance rates: HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.88]; term length: HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.73-0.86]). Effect estimates did not differ by race and were not attenuated by adjustment for educational attainment.
In this cohort study, lower state-average educational quality was more common among Black individuals and associated with higher dementia risk. Differential investment in high-quality education due to structural racism may contribute to dementia disparities.",[],JAMA neurology,2023-02-14,"[{'lastname': 'Soh', 'firstname': 'Yenee', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Whitmer', 'firstname': 'Rachel A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis.\nDepartment of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis.'}, {'lastname': 'Mayeda', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth Rose', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Glymour', 'firstname': 'M Maria', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Rachel L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'School of Public and Community Health Sciences, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana.'}, {'lastname': 'Eng', 'firstname': 'Chloe W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Quesenberry', 'firstname': 'Charles P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Manly', 'firstname': 'Jennifer J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.""}, {'lastname': 'Gilsanz', 'firstname': 'Paola', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.'}]",,,"Among 21 450 KPNC members who participated in the optional survey, individuals born before availability of educational quality records (n = 87) and missing educational attainment (n = 585) were excluded.

26784585",Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern Scores Are Not Associated with Worse Cognitive Performance in the Nurses' Health Study.,"Low-grade chronic inflammation associated with unhealthy diets may lead to cognitive aging.
We evaluated whether higher long-term adherence to an empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) was associated with lower cognitive function after age 70 y in the Nurses' Health Study.
A total of 16,058 older (mean ± SD age: 74 ± 2 y) highly educated (≥ bachelor degree) White women completed up to 5 validated 116-item food-frequency questionnaires. An EDIP score, previously derived with the use of reduced rank regression to predict circulating inflammatory markers (i.e., C-reactive protein, TNF-α receptor 2, and IL-6), was computed based on 9 anti-inflammatory and 9 proinflammatory components. A long-term EDIP score was calculated by averaging across 5 exams. The EDIP score was categorized into quintiles, taking the first (anti-inflammatory) quintile as the reference category. Cognitive testing was performed through telephone interviews over 4 follow-up exams (1995-2008). A composite global cognition score, a composite verbal memory score, and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) were calculated and averaged across the 4 exams (6 y of follow-up). Multivariable linear regressions were used to examine longitudinal relations under study.
Higher long-term EDIP scores (i.e., more proinflammatory) were significantly associated with worse performance on global cognitive function (P-trend= 0.018) and TICS (P-trend= 0.004) after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors. The associations became nonsignificant after additional adjustments for disease (related) risk factors for dementia. No association was observed between the EDIP score and verbal memory.
We observed no relation between long-term EDIP scores and averaged global cognitive function and verbal memory among older women. Our findings suggest no relation between long-term adherence to a proinflammatory diet and cognitive function in a large population of mostly White and generally highly educated older women. Future studies are encouraged to investigate the relation between inflammatory diets and cognitive function in other races/ethnicities and men, and over a longer follow-up period.","['Nurses’ Health Study', 'brain health', 'cognitive function', 'dietary pattern', 'inflammatory diet']",The Journal of nutrition,2023-02-12,"[{'lastname': 'Melo van Lent', 'firstname': 'Debora', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's & Neurodegenerative Diseases, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA; Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA; The Framingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA, USA.

127,36758770,The impact of loneliness and social isolation on the development of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, observed at a higher incidence in women compared with men. Treatments aimed at improving pathology in AD remain ineffective to stop disease progression. This makes the detection of the early intervention strategies to reduce future disease risk extremely important. Isolation and loneliness have been identified among the major risk factors for AD. The increasing prevalence of both loneliness and AD emphasizes the urgent need to understand this association to inform treatment. Here we present a comprehensive review of both clinical and preclinical studies that investigated loneliness and social isolation as risk factors for AD. We discuss that understanding the mechanisms of how loneliness exacerbates cognitive impairment and AD with a focus on sex differences will shed the light for the underlying mechanisms regarding loneliness as a risk factor for AD and to develop effective prevention or treatment strategies.","['Alzheimer’s Disease', 'Cognition', 'Loneliness', 'Risk factors', 'Sex differences', 'Social isolation']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2023-02-10,"[{'lastname': 'Ren', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Calgary, Canada; Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Savadlou', 'firstname': 'Aisouda', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Soobin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Siska', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Epp', 'firstname': 'Jonathan R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Calgary, Canada; Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sargin', 'firstname': 'Derya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Canada; Department of Physiology & Pharmacology, University of Calgary, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Canada.

We investigated these impacts of smoking, overweight/obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus on the risk of disabling dementia.
The study participants were 25,029 (10,134 men and 14,895 women) Japanese aged 40-74 years without disabling dementia at baseline (2008-2013). They were assessed on smoking status (non-current or current), overweight/obesity (body mass index ≥25 kg/m
During a median follow-up of 9.1 years, 1,322 (606 men and 716 women) developed disabling dementia. Current smoking and hypertension were associated with a higher risk of disabling dementia in both sexes, whereas overweight or obesity was not associated with the risk in either sex. Diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher risk only in women (p for sex interaction = 0.04). The significant PAFs were 13% for smoking and 14% for hypertension in men and 3% for smoking, 12% for hypertension, and 5% for diabetes mellitus in women. The total PAFs of the significant risk factors were 28% in men and 20% in women. When stratified by age, hypertension in midlife (40-64 years) was associated with the increased risk in men, while diabetes mellitus in later-life (65-74 years) was so in women.
A substantial burden of disabling dementia was attributable to smoking, and hypertension in both sexes and diabetes mellitus in women, which may require the management of these cardiovascular risk factors to prevent dementia.","['Cardiovascular risk factors', 'Dementia', 'Hazard ratio', 'Population attributable fractions']",Environmental health and preventive medicine,2023-02-06,"[{'lastname': 'Tanaka', 'firstname': 'Mari', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.\nDepartment of Public Health, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Imano', 'firstname': 'Hironori', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.\nDepartment of Public Health, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine.\nOsaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayama-Terada', 'firstname': 'Mina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Osaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.\nYao City Public Health Center, Yao City Office.'}, {'lastname': 'Muraki', 'firstname': 'Isao', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.\nOsaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Shirai', 'firstname': 'Kokoro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.\nInstitute of Global Health Policy Research (iGHP), Bureau of International Health Cooperation, National Center for Global Health and Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamagishi', 'firstname': 'Kazumasa', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Osaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.\nDepartment of Public Health Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, and Health Services Research and Development Center, University of Tsukuba.'}, {'lastname': 'Okada', 'firstname': 'Takeo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Osaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiyama', 'firstname': 'Masahiko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Osaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Kitamura', 'firstname': 'Akihiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Osaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.\nYao City Public Health Center, Yao City Office.'}, {'lastname': 'Takayama', 'firstname': 'Yoshihiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Yao City Public Health Center, Yao City Office.'}, {'lastname': 'Iso', 'firstname': 'Hiroyasu', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.\nOsaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.\nInstitute of Global Health Policy Research (iGHP), Bureau of International Health Cooperation, National Center for Global Health and Medicine.\nDepartment of Public Health Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, and Health Services Research and Development Center, University of Tsukuba.'}]",,,"During a median follow-up of 9.1 years, 1,322 (606 men and 716 women) developed disabling dementia.

34825046",Gender differences in the association between parity and cognitive function: Evidence from the UK biobank.,"While much previous work linking fertility history with late-life cognition has focused on a narrow set of cognitive measures and/or has used modest sample sizes in the analysis, our paper expands the size and scope of these linkages by analyzing cognitive function across five domains and precisely estimating gendered patterns between men and women. Results point to important gendered associations between parity and cognition: having children is likely associated with better cognitive function for fathers in all five domains. However, mothers show worse cognitive function in some domains (i.e., numeric memory, prospective memory, and fluid intelligence) than childless women. We explore the possibility of confounding in these associations and rule out the effects of genetic cognitive ability on fertility. We also find that adding controls for educational attainment differ by gender-strengthening associations between parity and cognition for men and largely eliminating them for women. The findings support previous work done on how life course contexts may link to the risk of dementia or cognitive impairment, highlighting parity as potential protective or risk factors to parents' cognitive health. The use of five cognitive domains yields variations in results, giving implications on measure selection of cognitive function and calling for replicated work covering more cognitive domains.","['Aging', 'Cognition', 'Fertility', 'Gender']",Social science & medicine (1982),2023-01-30,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Center for Demography of Health and Aging, University of Wisconsin, Madison, United States.

We aimed to assess the uptake of invitations to a lung health check offering low-dose CT lung cancer screening in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse cohort at high risk of lung cancer.
In this multicentre, prospective, longitudinal cohort study (SUMMIT), individuals aged 55-77 years with a history of smoking in the past 20 years were identified via National Health Service England primary care records at practices in northeast and north-central London, UK, using electronic searches. Eligible individuals were invited by letter to a lung health check offering lung cancer screening at one of four hospital sites, with non-responders re-invited after 4 months. Individuals were excluded if they had dementia or metastatic cancer, were receiving palliative care or were housebound, or declined research participation. The proportion of individuals invited who responded to the lung health check invitation by telephone was used to measure uptake. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate associations between uptake of a lung health check invitation and re-invitation of non-responders, adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, smoking, and deprivation score. This study was registered prospectively with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03934866.
Between March 20 and Dec 12, 2019, the records of 2 333 488 individuals from 251 primary care practices across northeast and north-central London were screened for eligibility; 1 974 919 (84·6%) individuals were outside the eligible age range, 7578 (2·1%) had pre-existing medical conditions, and 11 962 (3·3%) had opted out of particpation in research and thus were not invited. 95 297 individuals were eligible for invitation, of whom 29 545 (31·0%) responded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, re-invitation letters were sent to only a subsample of 4594 non-responders, of whom 642 (14·0%) responded. Overall, uptake was lower among men than among women (odds ratio [OR] 0·91 [95% CI 0·88-0·94]; p<0·0001), and higher among older age groups (1·48 [1·42-1·54] among those aged 65-69 years vs those aged 55-59 years; p<0·0001), groups with less deprivation (1·89 [1·76-2·04] for the most vs the least deprived areas; p<0·0001), individuals of Asian ethnicity (1·14 [1·09-1·20] vs White ethnicity; p<0·0001), and individuals who were former smokers (1·89 [1·83-1·95] vs current smokers; p<0·0001). When ethnicity was subdivided into 16 groups, uptake was lower among individuals of other White ethnicity than among those with White British ethnicity (0·86 [0·83-0·90]), whereas uptake was higher among Chinese, Indian, and other Asian ethnicities than among those with White British ethnicity (1·33 [1·13-1·56] for Chinese ethnicity; 1·29 [1·19-1·40] for Indian ethnicity; and 1·19 [1·08-1·31] for other Asian ethnicity).
Inviting eligible adults for lung health checks in areas of socioeconomic and ethnic diversity should achieve favourable participation in lung cancer screening overall, but inequalities by smoking, deprivation, and ethnicity persist. Reminder and re-invitation strategies should be used to increase uptake and the equity of response.

32088282","Frailty trajectories and associated factors in the years prior to death: evidence from 14 countries in the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe.","Age-related changes in frailty have been documented in the literature. However, the evidence regarding changes in frailty prior to death is scarce. Understanding patterns of frailty progression as individuals approach death could inform care and potentially lead to interventions to improve individual's well-being at the end of life. In this paper, we estimate the progression of frailty in the years prior to death.
Using data from 8,317 deceased participants of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, we derived a 56-item Frailty Index. In a coordinated analysis of repeated measures of the frailty index in 14 countries, we fitted growth curve models to estimate trajectories of frailty as a function of distance to death controlling both the level and rate of frailty progression for age, sex, years to death and dementia diagnosis.
Across all countries, frailty before death progressed linearly. In 12 of the 14 countries included in our analyses, women had higher levels of frailty close to the time of death, although they progressed at a slower rate than men (e.g. Switzerland (-0.008, SE = 0.003) and Spain (-0.004, SE = 0.002)). Older age at the time of death and incident dementia were associated with higher levels and increased rate of change in frailty, whilst higher education was associated with lower levels of frailty in the year preceding death (e.g. Denmark (0.000, SE = 0.001)).
The progression of frailty before death was linear. Our results suggest that interventions aimed at slowing frailty progression may need to be different for men and women. Further longitudinal research on individual patterns and changes of frailty is warranted to support the development of personalized care pathways at the end of life.","['Age-related changes', 'End of life care', 'Frailty trajectories', 'Longitudinal data', 'Mortality']",BMC geriatrics,2023-01-27,"[{'lastname': 'Jenkins', 'firstname': 'Natalie D', 'initials': 'ND', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.\nGlasgow Brain Injury Research Group, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Welstead', 'firstname': 'Miles', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland. miles.welstead@ed.ac.uk.'}, {'lastname': 'Stirland', 'firstname': 'Lucy', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoogendijk', 'firstname': 'Emiel O', 'initials': 'EO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam UMC - Location VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Armstrong', 'firstname': 'Joshua J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Robitaille', 'firstname': 'Annie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Muniz-Terrera', 'firstname': 'Graciela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.\nDepartment of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.\nDepartment Social Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, USA.'}]",,The progression of frailty before death was linear.

21873835",Sex Differences in Dementia.,"BackgroundWomen in many cohorts have a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Sex is a biological construct whereby differences in disease manifestation and prevalence are rooted in genetic differences between XX and XY combinations of chromosomes. This chapter focuses specifically on sex-driven differences in dementia, as opposed to differences driven by gender - a social construct referring to the societal norms that influence people's roles, relationships, and positional power throughout their lifetime.MethodsUsing a narrative review, this chapter explored the characteristics and risk factors for the dementias, alongside a discussion of sex differences including loss of sex steroid hormones in middle-aged women, differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and engagement in lifestyle protective factors for dementia.ResultsThe sex difference in AD prevalence may exist because of systematic and historic differences in risk and protective factors for dementia, including level of education obtained and socioeconomic status differences, which can impact on health and dementia risk.Levels of sex steroids decline significantly after menopause in women, whereas this is more gradual in men with age. Animal and cell culture studies show strong biological plausibility for sex steroids to protect the ageing brain against dementia. Sex steroid hormone replacement therapy has in some observational studies shown to protect against AD, but treatment studies in humans have mainly shown disappointing results. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) shares midlife medical risk (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity etc.) factors with AD and other forms of dementia, but also with related lifestyle risk - and protective factors (e.g. exercise, not smoking etc.). Men tend to die earlier of CVD, so fewer survive to develop AD at an older age. Those who do survive may have healthier lifestyles and fewer risk factors for both CVD and AD. An earlier age at menopause also confers great risk for both without hormone treatment.DiscussionIt could be the case that the decline in sex steroids around the menopause make women more susceptible to lifestyle-related risk factors associated with dementia and CVD, but this remains to be further investigated. Combining hormone treatment with lifestyle changes in midlife (e.g. exercise) could be an important preventative treatment for dementia and CVD in later life, but this also requires further research.","['Age', 'Cardiovascular', 'Dementia', 'Risk/protective factors', 'Sex', 'Sex steroids']",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2023-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Hogervorst', 'firstname': 'Eef', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine (NCSEM), School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences (SSEHS), Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK. e.hogervorst@lboro.ac.uk.'}, {'lastname': 'Temple', 'firstname': 'Sophie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine (NCSEM), School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences (SSEHS), Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Donnell"", 'firstname': 'Emma', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine (NCSEM), School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences (SSEHS), Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}]",,,,"© 2022.

28229124","Trends in prevalence, health disparities, and early detection of dementia: A 10-year nationally representative serial cross-sectional and cohort study.","To identify trends in the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, and to determine risk factors associated with the early detection of dementia among U.S. middle-aged and older adults.
We used 10-year nationally representative longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (2006-2016). Adults aged 55 years or older were included to examine the trend. To identify the associated factors, adults aged 55 years or older in 2006 who developed MCI or dementia in subsequent waves until the 2016 wave were included. Early and late detection of dementia were identified using the Langa-Weir classification of cognitive function. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the early detection of dementia.
The sample size for the analysis of the prevalence of MCI and dementia ranged from 14,935 to 16,115 in the six survey years, and 3,729 individuals were identified to determine associated factors of the early detection of dementia. Among them, participants aged 65 years or older accounted for 77.9%, and male participants accounted for 37.2%. The 10-year prevalence of MCI and dementia was 14.5 and 6.6%, respectively. We also found decreasing prevalence trends in MCI (from 14.9 to 13.6%) and dementia (from 7.4 to 6.0%) overall in the past decade. Using logistic regression controlling for the year, non-Hispanic black (MCI: OR = 2.83, 
This study found a decreasing trend in the prevalence of MCI and dementia in the past decade and associated racial/ethnic and gender disparities among U.S. middle-aged and older adults. Healthcare policies and strategies may be needed to address health disparities in the prevalence and take the associated factors of the early detection of dementia into account in clinical settings.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'dementia', 'early detection', 'middle-aged and older populations', 'mild cognitive impairment']",Frontiers in public health,2023-01-24,"[{'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Outcomes Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Xiong', 'firstname': 'Xiaomo', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Outcomes Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Minghui', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Translational Science, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy Administration, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Ye', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Friedman', 'firstname': 'Daniela B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Promotion, Education, and Behaviour, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States.'}]",,This study found a decreasing trend in the prevalence of MCI and dementia in the past decade and associated racial/ethnic and gender disparities among U.S. middle-aged and older adults.

4116908",Mendelian Randomisation Confirms the Role of Y-Chromosome Loss in Alzheimer's Disease Aetiopathogenesis in Men.,"Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) is a common ageing-related somatic event and has been previously associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, mLOY estimation from genotype microarray data only reflects the mLOY degree of subjects at the moment of DNA sampling. Therefore, mLOY phenotype associations with AD can be severely age-confounded in the context of genome-wide association studies. Here, we applied Mendelian randomisation to construct an age-independent mLOY polygenic risk score (mloy-PRS) using 114 autosomal variants. The mloy-PRS instrument was associated with an 80% increase in mLOY risk per standard deviation unit (","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'CSF biomarkers', 'EADB', 'GR@ACE/DEGESCO', 'GWAS', 'Mendelian

32051121",Association of social isolation and loneliness with risk of incident hospital-treated infections: an analysis of data from the UK Biobank and Finnish Health and Social Support studies.,"Although loneliness and social isolation have been linked to an increased risk of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, their association with the risk of severe infection is uncertain. We aimed to examine the associations between loneliness and social isolation and the risk of hospital-treated infections using data from two independent cohort studies.
We assessed the association between loneliness and social isolation and incident hospital-treated infections using data for participants from the UK Biobank study aged 38-73 years at baseline and participants from the nationwide population-based Finnish Health and Social Support (HeSSup) study aged 20-54 years at baseline. For inclusion in the study, participants had to be linked to national health registries, have no history of hospital-treated infections at or before baseline, and have complete data on loneliness or social isolation. Participants with missing data on hospital-treated infections, loneliness, and social isolation were excluded from both cohorts. The outcome was defined as a hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of infection, ascertained via linkage to electronic health records.
After exclusion of 8·6 million participants for not responding or not providing appropriate consent, the UK Biobank cohort consisted of 456 905 participants (249 586 women and 207 319 men). 26 860 (6·2%) of 436 001 participants with available data were reported as being lonely and 40 428 (9·0%) of 448 114 participants with available data were socially isolated. During a median 8·9 years (IQR 8·0-9·6) of follow-up, 51 361 participants were admitted to hospital due to an infectious disease. After adjustment for age, sex, demographic and lifestyle factors, and morbidities, loneliness was associated with an increased risk of a hospital-treated infection (hazard ratio [HR] 1·12 [95% CI 1·07-1·16]), whereas social isolation was not (HR 1·01 [95% CI 0·97-1·04]). Of 64 797 individuals in the HeSSup cohort, 18 468 (11 367 women and 7101 men) were eligible for inclusion. 4466 (24·4%) of 18 296 were lonely and 1776 (9·7%) of 18 376 socially isolated. During a median follow-up of 10·0 years (IQR 10·0-10·1), 814 (4·4%) participants were admitted to hospital for an infectious disease. The HRs for the HeSSup study replicated those in the UK Biobank (multivariable-adjusted HR for loneliness 1·32 [95% CI 1·06-1·64]; 1·08 [0·87-1·35] for social isolation).
Loneliness might increase susceptibility to severe infections, although the magnitude of this effect appears modest and residual confounding cannot be excluded. Interventional studies are required before policy recommendations can advance.

24753662",Mortality of Deep Brain Stimulation and Risk Factors in Patients With Parkinson's Disease: A National Cohort Study in Korea.,"This study aimed to investigate 1) long-term outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS), such as mortality after DBS as well as the causes of death, 2) demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing mortality, and 3) comorbidities affecting mortality after DBS in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
This study analyzed the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Information Database. Data on patients with PD diagnosis codes from 2002 to 2019 were extracted and analyzed. Data on the causes of death were obtained by linking the causes of death to data from Statistics Korea. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was used for survival analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals. Regarding comorbidities such as PD dementia and fracture, which did not satisfy the assumption for the proportional HR, time-dependent Cox analysis with the Mantel-Byar method was used.
From 2005 to 2017, among 156,875 patients diagnosed with PD in Korea, 1,079 patients underwent DBS surgery, and 251 (23.3%) had died by 2019. The most common cause of death (47.1%) was PD. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the higher the age at diagnosis and surgery, the higher the mortality rate. The men and medical aid groups had significantly higher mortality rates. PD dementia and fracture were identified as risk factors for mortality.
Older age at diagnosis and surgery, being male, the use of medical aid, and the comorbidity of dementia and fractures were associated with a higher risk of mortality after DBS in patients with PD. Neurologists should consider these risk factors in assessing the prognosis of PD patients undergoing DBS.","['Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Mortality', 'National Cohort Study', ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'Socioeconomic Status']",Journal of Korean medical science,2023-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ahro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Hui-Jun', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwon', 'firstname': 'Jee-Hyun', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Min-Ho', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Informatization Department, Ewha Womans University Seoul Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jiho', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea. leejh@uuh.ulsan.kr.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeon', 'firstname': 'Beomseok', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. brain@snu.ac.kr.'}]",,"Older age at diagnosis and surgery, being male, the use of medical aid, and the comorbidity of dementia and fractures were associated with a higher risk of mortality after DBS in patients with PD.

139,36641611,Gender-Specific Design and Effectiveness of Non-Pharmacological Interventions against Cognitive Decline - Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"The number of people living with dementia worldwide is increasing rapidly. Preventive approaches constitute a promising strategy to counter the dementia epidemic, and growing numbers of lifestyle interventions are conducted around the globe. Gender differences with respect to modifiable risk factors for dementia have been reported, however, little is known about gender-specific effectiveness of lifestyle trials against cognitive decline and dementia. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess evidence on gender-specific design and effectiveness of randomized controlled trials against cognitive decline.
Systematic literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central and ALOIS. Studies assessing global and/or domain-specific cognitive function in older adults free from dementia were eligible for the systematic review. We assessed between-group effect sizes using random-effects meta-analysis. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)-checklist.
The systematic review and meta-analysis included 34 and 31 studies, respectively. Effects of lifestyle-interventions on global cognition were non-significant overall (g = .27; 95% CI: -.01; .56) and in male subsamples (g = -.05; 95% CI: -.55; .45), and small for female subsamples (g = .38; 95% CI: .05; .72). Small beneficial effects were found for memory (overall: g = .38; 95% CI = .17; .59). Stratified by gender, significant effects were observed only in women (g = .39; 95% CI = .13; .65; men: g = .37; 95% CI: .00; .73). Aspects of gender in study design and conduct were discussed in a small minority of studies. Comparable results were observed for executive function and verbal fluency. Methodological quality was deemed high in 17.6% of studies, acceptable and low quality in 52.9% and 29.4%, respectively.
We found evidence for small differences in the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on global cognition and memory in favor of women. However, small numbers of trials 1) targeting men and 2) reporting gender-specific results for older adults with mild cognitive impairment warrant further attention. Assessing differences in modifiable risk factors for dementia in men and women and systematically addressing aspects of gender in trial conduction and recruitment in future studies might increase knowledge on gender-specific effectiveness of lifestyle trials against cognitive decline.","['Dementia', 'cognition', 'gender', 'lifestyle', 'meta-analysis', 'prevention', 'systematic review']",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2023-01-16,"[{'lastname': 'Zülke', 'firstname': 'A E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Andrea E.

35544996",Machine learning for predicting neurodegenerative diseases in the general older population: a cohort study.,"In the older general population, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are associated with increased disability, decreased physical and cognitive function. Detecting risk factors can help implement prevention measures. Using deep neural networks (DNNs), a machine-learning algorithm could be an alternative to Cox regression in tabular datasets with many predictive features. We aimed to compare the performance of different types of DNNs with regularized Cox proportional hazards models to predict NDs in the older general population.
We performed a longitudinal analysis with participants of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. We included men and women with no NDs at baseline, aged 60 years and older, assessed every 2 years from 2004 to 2005 (wave2) to 2016-2017 (wave 8). The features were a set of 91 epidemiological and clinical baseline variables. The outcome was new events of Parkinson's, Alzheimer or dementia. After applying multiple imputations, we trained three DNN algorithms: Feedforward, TabTransformer, and Dense Convolutional (Densenet). In addition, we trained two algorithms based on Cox models: Elastic Net regularization (CoxEn) and selected features (CoxSf).
5433 participants were included in wave 2. During follow-up, 12.7% participants developed NDs. Although the five models predicted NDs events, the discriminative ability was superior using TabTransformer (Uno's C-statistic (coefficient (95% confidence intervals)) 0.757 (0.702, 0.805). TabTransformer showed superior time-dependent balanced accuracy (0.834 (0.779, 0.889)) and specificity (0.855 (0.0.773, 0.909)) than the other models. With the CoxSf (hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals)), age (10.0 (6.9, 14.7)), poor hearing (1.3 (1.1, 1.5)) and weight loss 1.3 (1.1, 1.6)) were associated with a higher DNN risk. In contrast, executive function (0.3 (0.2, 0.6)), memory (0, 0, 0.1)), increased gait speed (0.2, (0.1, 0.4)), vigorous physical activity (0.7, 0.6, 0.9)) and higher BMI (0.4 (0.2, 0.8)) were associated with a lower DNN risk.
TabTransformer is promising for prediction of NDs with heterogeneous tabular datasets with numerous features. Moreover, it can handle censored data. However, Cox models perform well and are easier to interpret than DNNs. Therefore, they are still a good choice for NDs.","['Alzheimer', 'Cox models', 'Deep neural networks', 'Dementia', 'Older general population', 'Parkinson disease', 'Prediction', 'Tabular data']",BMC medical research methodology,2023-01-12,"[{'lastname': 'Aguayo', 'firstname': 'Gloria A', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Deep Digital Phenotyping Research Unit, Department of Precision Health, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg. gloria.aguayo@lih.lu.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Lu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Platform, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaillant', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Competence Center for Methodology and Statistics, Translational Medicine Operations Hub, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.'}, {'lastname': 'Ngari', 'firstname': 'Moses', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Competence Center for Methodology and Statistics, Translational Medicine Operations Hub, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.\nKEMRI/Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Perquin', 'firstname': 'Magali', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Precision Health, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.'}, {'lastname': 'Moran', 'firstname': 'Valerie', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Precision Health, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.\nLiving Conditions Department, Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research, Esch-Sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.'}, {'lastname': 'Huiart', 'firstname': 'Laetitia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Precision Health, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.'}, {'lastname': 'Krüger', 'firstname': 'Rejko', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'LCSB, Luxembourg Centre for System Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-Sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.\nParkinson Research Clinic, Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.\nTransversal Translational Medicine, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.'}, {'lastname': 'Azuaje', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Platform, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.\nGenomics England, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferdynus', 'firstname': 'Cyril', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Methodological Support Unit, Félix Guyon University Hospital Center, Saint-Denis, La Réunion, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Fagherazzi', 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Deep Digital Phenotyping Research Unit, Department of Precision Health, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.'}]",,"TabTransformer is promising for prediction of NDs with heterogeneous tabular datasets with numerous features.

30333106",Leading mediators of sex differences in the incidence of dementia in community-dwelling adults in the UK Biobank: a retrospective cohort study.,"Little is known regarding whether sex assigned at birth modifies the association between several predictive factors for dementia and the risk of dementia itself.
Our retrospective cohort study included 214,670 men and 214,670 women matched by age at baseline from the UK Biobank. Baseline data were collected between 2006 and 2010, and incident dementia was ascertained using hospital inpatient or death records until January 2021. Mediation analysis was tested for 133 individual factors.
Over 5,117,381 person-years of follow-up, 5928 cases of incident all-cause dementia (452 cases of young-onset dementia, 5476 cases of late-onset dementia) were documented. Hazard ratios (95% CI) for all-cause, young-onset, and late-onset dementias associated with the male sex (female as reference) were 1.23 (1.17-1.29), 1.42 (1.18-1.71), and 1.21 (1.15-1.28), respectively. Out of 133 individual factors, the strongest mediators for the association between sex and incident dementia were multimorbidity risk score (percentage explained (95% CI): 62.1% (45.2-76.6%)), apolipoprotein A in the blood (25.5% (15.2-39.4%)), creatinine in urine (24.9% (16.1-36.5%)), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood (23.2% (16.2-32.1%)), and blood lymphocyte percentage (21.1% (14.5-29.5%)). Health-related conditions (percentage (95% CI) explained: 74.4% (51.3-88.9%)) and biomarkers (83.0% (37.5-97.5%)), but not lifestyle factors combined (30.1% (20.7-41.6%)), fully mediated sex differences in incident dementia. Health-related conditions combined were a stronger mediator for late-onset (75.4% (48.6-90.8%)) than for young-onset dementia (52.3% (25.8-77.6%)), whilst lifestyle factors combined were a stronger mediator for young-onset (42.3% (19.4-69.0%)) than for late-onset dementia (26.7% (17.1-39.2%)).
Our analysis matched by age has demonstrated that men had a higher risk of all-cause, young-onset, and late-onset dementias than women. This association was fully mediated by health-related conditions or blood/urinary biomarkers and largely mediated by lifestyle factors. Our findings are important for understanding potential mechanisms of sex in dementia risk.","['Biomarker', 'Dementia', 'Lifestyle', 'Mediation analysis', 'Multimorbidity risk score',

142,36610448,Derivation and validation of the CFracture competing risk fracture prediction tool compared with QFracture in older people and people with comorbidity: a population cohort study.,"UK guidelines recommend the QFracture tool to predict the risk of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture, but QFracture calibration is poor, partly because it does not account for competing mortality risk. The aim of this study was to derive and validate a competing risk model to predict major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture (CFracture) and compare its performance with that of QFracture in UK primary care.
We used UK linked primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database to identify people aged 30-99 years, split into derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, we derived models (CFracture) using the same covariates as QFracture with Fine-Gray competing risk modelling, and included the Charlson Comorbidity Index score as an additional predictor of non-fracture death. In a separate validation cohort, we examined discrimination (using Harrell's C-statistic) and calibration of CFracture compared with QFracture. Reclassification analysis examined differences in the characteristics of patients reclassified as higher risk by CFracture but not by QFracture.
The derivation cohort included 1 831 606 women and 1 789 820 men, and the validation cohort included 915 803 women and 894 910 men. Overall discrimination of CFracture was excellent (C-statistic=0·813 [95% CI 0·810-0·816] for major osteoporotic fracture and 0·914 [0·908-0·919] for hip fracture in women; 0·734 [0·729-0·740] for major osteoporotic fracture and 0·886 [0·877-0·895] for hip fracture in men) and was similar to QFracture. CFracture calibration overall and in people younger than 75 years was generally excellent. CFracture overpredicted major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture in older people and people with comorbidity, but was better calibrated than QFracture. Patients classified as high-risk by CFracture but not by QFracture had a higher prevalence of current smoking and previous fracture, but lower prevalence of dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and diabetes.
CFracture has similar discrimination to QFracture but is better calibrated overall and in younger people. Both models performed poorly in adults aged 85 years and older. Competing risk models should be recommended for fracture risk prediction to guide treatment recommendations.

17938389",Sex/gender and socioeconomic differences in modifiable risk factors for dementia.,"Both sex/gender and socioeconomic differences have been reported in the prevalence of modifiable risk factors for dementia. However, it remains unclear whether the associations between modifiable risk factors for dementia and incident dementia differ by sex/gender or socioeconomic status. This study aimed to investigate sex/gender and socioeconomic differences in the associations of modifiable risk factors with incident dementia using a life-course perspective. We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2008/2009 to 2018/2019). A total of 8,941 individuals were included [mean (standard deviation) age, 66.1 ± 9.8 years; 4,935 (55.2%) were women]. No overall sex/gender difference in dementia risk was found. Dementia risk was higher among those who experienced childhood deprivation [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.51 (1.17; 1.96)], lower occupational attainment [HR low versus high = 1.60 (1.23; 2.09) and HR medium versus high = 1.53 (1.15; 2.06)], and low wealth [HR low versus high = 1.63 (1.26; 2.12)]. Though different associations were found among the subgroups, there might be a sex/gender difference in dementia risk only for low cognitive activity, suggesting a higher risk for women [HR = 2.61 (1.89; 3.60)] compared to men [HR = 1.73 (1.20; 2.49)]. No consistent socioeconomic differences in modifiable dementia risk were found. A population-based approach that tackles inequalities in dementia risk profiles directly may be more effective than individual approaches in dementia prevention.",[],Scientific reports,2023-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Geraets', 'firstname': 'Anouk F J', 'initials': 'AFJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Sciences, University of Luxembourg, Campus Belval, Maison Des Sciences Humaines, 11 Porte Des Sciences, L-4366, Esch-Sur-Alzette, Luxembourg. anouk.geraets@uni.lu.'}, {'lastname': 'Leist', 'firstname': 'Anja K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Sciences, University of Luxembourg, Campus Belval, Maison Des Sciences Humaines, 11 Porte Des Sciences, L-4366, Esch-Sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.'}]",,,,© 2023.

144,36594424,Is incident cancer in later life associated with lower incidence of dementia?,"Cancer has been associated with lower risk of dementia, although methodological issues raise concerns about the validity of this association. We recruited 31,080 men aged 65-85 years who were free of cancer and dementia, and followed them for up to 22 years. We used health record linkage to identify incident cases of cancer and dementia, and split time span to investigate this association. 18,693 (60.1%) and 6897 (22.2%) participants developed cancer and dementia during follow-up. The hazard ratio (HR) of dementia associated with cancer was 1.13 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.20) and dropped to 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80, 0.91) when 449 participants who developed dementia within 2 years were excluded. The diagnosis of cancer seems to facilitate the early detection of dementia cases. Older participants who survive cancer for 2 or more years have lower risk of receiving the diagnosis of dementia over time. The factors that mediate this association remain unclear.","['Alzheimer’s disease (AD)', 'cancer', 'dementia', 'epidemiology']",International psychogeriatrics,2023-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Almeida', 'firstname': 'Osvaldo P', 'initials': 'OP', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.\nWA Centre for Health & Ageing, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hankey', 'firstname': 'Graeme J', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.\nDepartment of Neurology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Yeap', 'firstname': 'Bu B', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Golledge', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Queensland Research Centre for Peripheral Vascular Disease, College of Medicine and Dentistry, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.\nDepartment of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, The Townsville Hospital, Townsville, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Etherton-Beer', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.\nWA Centre for Health & Ageing, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Robinson', 'firstname': 'Suzanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Deakin Health Economics, Deakin University, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Flicker', 'firstname': 'Leon', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.\nWA Centre for Health & Ageing, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.'}]",,,,,10.1017/S1041610222001119,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de3a97c0>,,,,,,

31822846",Androgen Deprivation Therapy Unrelated to Alzheimer's Disease in the UK Biobank Cohort.,"In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, men who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer had a higher risk of dementia and/or Alzheimer disease (AD) than men who did not receive ADT. The effect was more pronounced when ADT was given for more than 12 months. However, in all these analyses, two of the strongest AD risk factors after age, family history of AD and the apolipoprotein e4 allele, were not included. In the current study, we have used data from the UK Biobank (UKB) that incorporates these two factors.
Our analysis included all subjects with prostate cancer and AD. Prostate cancer diagnosis was ascertained using the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10), C61. AD diagnosis was ascertained using the 10
We studied 13,203 men with prostate cancer. The age of 132 subjects that received ADT was 64±5.6 (mean±standard deviation), and the age of 13,071 subjects that did not receive ADT was 62±5.6 (p<0.001). ADT was not associated with AD, but Apoe3e3 was significantly associated with diminished risk of AD when compared to e4e4. Moreover, every year of age was associated with increased risk of AD.

Baseline data of cognitively healthy subjects ≥45 years of age, from two longitudinal, aging cohorts in rural (n = 3262) and urban (n = 693) India, were used to calculate prevalence of depression, early-life stressful events, stroke, head injury, and cognitive impairment.
Depression prevalence was significantly higher in rural than urban subjects, with female preponderance in both groups. Early life stressor (parental death) and head injury were significantly more common in rural than in urban India, whereas stroke was more in urban India. There was no significant difference in overall prevalence of cognitive impairment between the rural and urban cohorts; however, women had higher prevalence than men in rural, whereas this was reverse in urban subjects. Depression and stroke were significantly associated with cognitive impairment in the rural cohort.
Longitudinal assessment of these neuropsychiatric conditions, with parallel cognitive monitoring, will help identify their causal relationship with dementia.","['India', 'cognitive impairment', 'dementia', 'head injury', 'neuropsychiatric conditions', 'risk factors depression', 'stroke']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2022-12-28,"[{'lastname': 'Sundarakumar', 'firstname': 'Jonas S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Menesgere', 'firstname': 'Abhishek L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jain', 'firstname': 'Shubham', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Hameed', 'firstname': 'Shafeeq K S', 'initials': 'SKS', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ravindranath', 'firstname': 'Vijayalakshmi', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.'}]",,,"Depression prevalence was significantly higher in rural than urban subjects, with female preponderance in both groups.

This racial disparity may be attributable to polygenic risk, as well as lifestyle and behavioural factors. We examined whether Alzheimer's disease polygenic score and race predict Alzheimer's disease and other related dementia incidence differentially by sex and mediation through polygenic scores for other health and behavioural conditions. We used longitudinal data from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study. We restricted participants to those with complete data on 31 polygenic scores, including Alzheimer's disease polygenic score (2006-2012).

30478135",Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Risk of Alzheimer Disease and Mortality: A Latent Class Approach.,"Background Cardiovascular risk factors co-occur with one another, and little is known about the extent of their clustering and risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). We identify groups of cardiovascular risk factors in cognitively normal individuals and investigate between-group differences in incident AD and death. Methods and Results Cognitively normal individuals were recruited from the National Alzheimer's Coordinator Center. A latent class analysis was conducted with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, heart condition, stroke, smoking history, diabetes, and high body mass index. Between-group differences in the incidence of AD, mortality, and mortality-adjusted AD were investigated. This study included 12 412 cognitively normal individuals (average follow-up, 65 months). Three groups were identified: (1) low probabilities of cardiovascular risk factors (reference; N=5398 [43%]), (2) hypertension and hypercholesterolemia (vascular-dominant; N=5721 [46%]), and (3) hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and high body mass index (vascular-metabolic; N=1293 [10%]). Both vascular groups were significantly older, had more men, were slightly less educated, and were slightly more cognitively impaired than the reference group (all ","['Alzheimer disease', 'cardiovascular risk factors', 'epidemiology']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2022-12-25,"[{'lastname': 'Ruthirakuhan', 'firstname': 'Myuri', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Hurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto Ontario Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Cogo-Moreira', 'firstname': 'Hugo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Education, ICT and Learning Ostfold University College Halden Norway.\nUniversidade Federal de Sao Paulo Sao Paulo Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Swardfager', 'firstname': 'Walter', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Hurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto Ontario Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Herrmann', 'firstname': 'Nathan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Hurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto Ontario Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanctot', 'firstname': 'Krista L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Hurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto Ontario Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Black', 'firstname': 'Sandra E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Hurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto Ontario Canada.\nUniversity of Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada.'}]",,,,,"10.1161/JAHA.122.025724

24997674","Appendicular Lean Mass, Grip Strength, and the Incidence of Dementia Among Older Adults in the Health ABC Study.","Identification of novel risk factors for dementia in older adults could facilitate development of methods to identify patients most at risk and improve their cognitive outcomes. We aimed to determine whether lower appendicular lean mass (ALM), assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and lower grip strength are associated with a greater likelihood of incident dementia among older adults in the Health Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC).
Health ABC data from 1997 to 2008 were analyzed (n = 2 704). Baseline ALM to body mass index (BMI) ratio (ALMBMI) was assessed by DXA. Baseline grip strength was assessed by hand-held dynamometry. Incident dementia diagnosis was defined as either (i) dementia-related hospitalization plus a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) score of ≤ 90; or (ii) record of prescription for anti-dementia medication; or (iii) decline of at least 1.5 SDs on the 3MS score compared to baseline. Cox proportional hazard models estimated associations of ALMBMI and grip strength with incident dementia over follow-up with and without adjusting for covariates, stratified by sex.
Among older men, each standard deviation decrement in ALMBMI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.65) or grip strength (aHR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.41) was associated with increased likelihood of incident dementia.
Lower ALMBMI and grip strength may be important risk factors for the development of dementia among older men. How these factors may belong to a causal pathway of dementia must be elucidated in future work.","['Body composition', 'Cognition', 'Muscle', 'Sex']","The journals of gerontology.

150,36525370,"Association Between Alcohol Use Disorders and Dementia in 262,703 Dementia-free Finnish Adults: Is Cardiovascular Disease a Mediator?","The possible mediating role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the relationship between alcohol use disorders (AUD) and the risk of early-onset (<age 65) and late-onset (≥age 65) dementia lacks formal investigation.
Using linked Finnish national register data, a population-based cohort study of 262,703 dementia-free Finnish men and women aged 40 + at baseline (December 31, 1999) was established. AUD and CVD in 1988-2014, and incident dementia in 2000-2014 were identified from Finnish Hospital Discharge Register and/or Drug Reimbursement Register. Causal association and mediation were assessed using mediational g-formula.

32719596",Parietal and occipital leukoaraiosis due to cerebral ischaemic lesions decrease the driving safety performance of healthy older adults.,"Leukoaraiosis, a common ischaemic lesion diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can influence driving safety performance (DSP). Most older drivers with leukoaraiosis are unaware of their affliction. Japan is a super-aged country, where preventing accidents caused by older drivers is an urgent national issue. We investigated the subcortical and periventricular leukoaraiosis regions that were most involved in DSP decline. The driving skills of 101 drivers (49 men, 52 women; mean age, 77.88 ± 3.77 years) without dementia were assessed by official driving instructors, using actual vehicles on a closed-circuit course. Parietal and occipital (but not frontal or temporal) leukoaraiosis volumes were significantly correlated with decreased DSP scores regardless of age, especially when turning right at intersections, which needs more attention than turning left because left-side driving is legally enforced in Japan. Occipital leukoaraiosis was also involved via a decline in dynamic visual cognitive function. MRI-based assessment of leukoaraiosis volume and localisation may enable the identification of older drivers prone to DSP deterioration. Risk factors for leukoaraiosis include smoking and lifestyle-related diseases such as hypertension. Thus, brain healthcare in patients with MRI-diagnosed leukoaraiosis may be particularly useful for the risk management of traffic accidents caused by the elderly in Japan.",[],Scientific reports,2022-12-13,"[{'lastname': 'Oba', 'firstname': 'Hikaru', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki University, 66-1, Hon-Cho, Hirosaki, Aomori, 036-8564, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Kaechang', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Traffic Medicine Laboratory, Research Organization for Regional Alliance, Kochi University of Technology, 185 Miyanokuchi Tosayamada-Cho, Kami, Kochi, 782-0003, Japan. park.kaechang@kochi-tech.ac.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamashita', 'firstname': 'Fumio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Division of Ultrahigh Field MRI, Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Iwate Medical University, 1-1-1 Idaidori, Yahaba-Cho, Shiwa-Gun, Iwate, 028-3694, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sato', 'firstname': 'Shinichi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Human Sciences, Osaka University, 1-2, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.'}]",,,,© 2022.

31781745","Predictors of longitudinal cognitive ageing from age 70 to 82 including APOE e4 status, early-life and lifestyle factors: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.","Discovering why some people's cognitive abilities decline more than others is a key challenge for cognitive ageing research. The most effective strategy may be to address multiple risk factors from across the life-course simultaneously in relation to robust longitudinal cognitive data. We conducted a 12-year follow-up of 1091 (at age 70) men and women from the longitudinal Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study. Comprehensive repeated cognitive measures of visuospatial ability, processing speed, memory, verbal ability, and a general cognitive factor were collected over five assessments (age 70, 73, 76, 79, and 82 years) and analysed using multivariate latent growth curve modelling. Fifteen life-course variables were used to predict variation in cognitive ability levels at age 70 and cognitive slopes from age 70 to 82. Only APOE e4 carrier status was found to be reliably informative of general- and domain-specific cognitive decline, despite there being many life-course correlates of cognitive level at age 70. APOE e4 carriers had significantly steeper slopes across all three fluid cognitive domains compared with non-carriers, especially for memory (β = -0.234, p < 0.001) and general cognitive function (β = -0.246, p < 0.001), denoting a widening gap in cognitive functioning with increasing age. Our findings suggest that when many other candidate predictors of cognitive ageing slope are entered en masse, their unique contributions account for relatively small proportions of variance, beyond variation in APOE e4 status. We conclude that APOE e4 status is important for identifying those at greater risk for accelerated cognitive ageing, even among ostensibly healthy individuals.",[],Molecular psychiatry,2022-12-10,"[{'lastname': 'Corley', 'firstname': 'Janie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Lothian Birth Cohorts, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.

154,36444569,Adiposity in the older population and the risk of dementia: The Rotterdam Study.,"We determined associations of total and regional adiposity with incident dementia among older adults.
Within the population-based Rotterdam Study, adiposity was measured as total, android, and gynoid fat mass using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 3408 men and 4563 women, every 3 to 6 years between 2002 and 2016. Incident dementia was recorded until 2020.
Higher adiposity measures were associated with a decreased risk of dementia in both sexes. After excluding the first 5 years of follow-up, only the association of gynoid fat among women remained significant (hazard ratio 0.85 [95% confidence interval 0.75-0.97] per standard deviation increase). No major differences in trajectories of adiposity measures were observed between dementia cases and dementia-free controls.
Higher total and regional fat mass related to a decreased risk of dementia. These results may be explained by reverse causality, although a protective effect of adiposity cannot be excluded.
Total and regional adiposity were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans in 7971 older adults. All adiposity measures were associated with a decreased risk of dementia. The results suggest a beneficial effect of gynoid fat on the risk of dementia in women. Reverse causation and competing risk may explain these inverse associations.","['abdominal fat', 'adiposity', 'body composition', 'dementia', 'obesity']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2022-11-30,"[{'lastname': 'Mooldijk', 'firstname': 'Sanne S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Crom', 'firstname': 'Tosca O E', 'initials': 'TOE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ikram', 'firstname': 'M Kamran', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\nDepartment of Neurology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ikram', 'firstname': 'M Arfan', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Voortman', 'firstname': 'Trudy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\nDivision of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, the Netherlands.'}]",,,"Higher adiposity measures were associated with a decreased risk of dementia in both sexes.

21112623","Assessment of cognitive function among adults aged ≥ 60 years using the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale: cross-sectional study, Lao People's Democratic Republic.","Rapid population ageing remains an important concern for health, social and economics systems; thus, a broader assessment of cognitive decline among adults aged ≥ 60 years is essential. It is important to regularly collect reliable data through validated and affordable methods from people living in different areas and in different circumstances to better understand the significance of this health problem. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of cognitive impairment and the related risk factors by reassessing the scoring of the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale among older adults in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
A community-based cross-sectional investigation was conducted in rural and urban settings in six districts of three provinces in the country from January to July 2020. In total, 2206 individuals aged 60-98 years (1110 men and 1096 women) were interviewed in person using a pretested Lao version of the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale and the WHO STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factor surveillance (the STEPS survey tool). The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using a logistic model.
The study found that 49.3% (1088/2206) of respondents (39.7% [441/1110] of men and 59.0% [647/1096] of women) had scores associated with some level of cognitive impairment. In addition to age, the following factors were significantly associated with cognitive impairment: having no formal education (AOR = 9.5; 95% CI: 5.4 to 16.8, relative to those with a university education), living in the northern region of the country (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.9, relative to living in the central region), living in a rural area (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2 to 1.8), needing assistance with self-care (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.7) and being underweight (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.2). Factors associated with no cognitive impairment among older adults include engaging in moderate-intensity physical activity lasting for 10 minutes and up to 1 hour (AOR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5 to 0.8) and for > 1 hour (AOR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4 to 0.8).
Using the Lao version of the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale, this study found that more than half of adults aged ≥ 60 years had cognitive impairment, and this impairment was associated with several risk factors. The limitations of this study may include possible overdetection due to the cutoff point for the assessment of cognitive decline used in the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale, given that the participants were not familiar with the instrument. However, the study results can be used to help inform health policy in the Lao People's Democratic Republic regarding the urgent need for a routine data collection system and for providing an environment that addresses and reduces the identified risk factors for cognitive decline to mitigate their impact.","['Dementia', 'Health system strengthening', 'Lao People’s Democratic Republic', 'Low- and middle-income countries', 'Population ageing']",Health research policy and systems,2022-11-30,"[{'lastname': 'Kounnavong', 'firstname': 'Sengchanh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Lao Tropical and Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic. skounnavong@gmail.com.""}, {'lastname': 'Vonglokham', 'firstname': 'Manithong', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Lao Tropical and Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.""}, {'lastname': 'Sayasone', 'firstname': 'Somphou', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Lao Tropical and Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.""}, {'lastname': 'Savathdy', 'firstname': 'Vanthanom', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Lao Tropical and Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.""}, {'lastname': 'Masaki', 'firstname': 'Emiko', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""The World Bank, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.""}, {'lastname': 'Kayano', 'firstname': 'Ryoma', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Development, World Health Organization, Kobe, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Phoummalaysith', 'firstname': 'Bounfeng', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': ""Ministry of Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.""}, {'lastname': 'Boupha', 'firstname': 'Boungnong', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': ""Lao Tropical and Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.""}, {'lastname': 'Hamajima', 'firstname': 'Nobuyuki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.'}]",,,"The study found that 49.3% (1088/2206) of respondents (39.7% [441/1110] of men and 59.0% [647/1096] of women) had scores associated with some level of cognitive impairment.

28323064",Association of Klotho Protein Levels and KL-VS Heterozygosity With Alzheimer Disease and Amyloid and Tau Burden.,"Identification of proteins and genetic factors that reduce Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology is of importance when searching for novel AD treatments. Heterozygosity of the KL-VS haplotype has been associated with reduced amyloid and tau burden. Whether this association is mediated by the Klotho protein remains unclear.
To assess concentrations of Klotho in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma among cognitively healthy controls and patients with AD and to correlate these findings with KL-VS heterozygosity status and amyloid and tau burden.
This case-control study combined 2 independent case-control AD cohorts consisting of 243 referred patients with AD and volunteer controls recruited from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018. Klotho levels were measured in CSF and plasma and correlated with KL-VS heterozygosity status and levels of CSF amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1, 2021, to March 1, 2022.
Associations of Klotho levels in CSF and plasma with levels of CSF biomarkers were analyzed using linear regression. Association analyses were stratified separately by clinical groups, APOE4 status, and KL-VS heterozygosity. Pearson correlation was used to assess the correlation between CSF and plasma Klotho levels.
A total of 243 participants were included: 117 controls (45 men [38.5%]; median age, 65 years [range, 41-84 years]), 102 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (AD-MCI; 59 men [57.8%]; median age, 66 years [range, 46-80 years]), and 24 patients with dementia due to AD (AD-dementia; 12 men [50.0%]; median age, 64.5 years [range, 54-75 years]). Median CSF Klotho levels were higher in controls (1236.4 pg/mL [range, 20.4-1726.3 pg/mL]; β = 0.103; 95% CI, 0.023-0.183; P = .01) and patients with AD-MCI (1188.1 pg/mL [range, 756.3-1810.3 pg/mL]; β = 0.095; 95% CI, 0.018-0.172; P = .02) compared with patients with AD-dementia (1073.3 pg/mL [range, 698.2-1661.4 pg/mL]). Higher levels of CSF Klotho were associated with lower CSF Aβ42 burden (β = 0.519; 95% CI, 0.201-0.836; P < .001) and tau burden (CSF total tau levels: β = -0.884; 95% CI, 0.223 to -0.395; P < .001; CSF phosphorylated tau levels: β = -0.672; 95% CI, -1.022 to -0.321; P < .001) independent of clinical, KL-VS heterozygosity, or APOE4 status. There was a weak correlation between Klotho CSF and plasma levels among the entire cohort (Pearson correlation r = 0.377; P < .001).
The findings of this case-control study suggest that Klotho protein levels were associated with clinical stages of AD, cognitive decline, and amyloid and tau burden and that these outcomes were more clearly mediated by the protein directly rather than the KL-VS heterozygosity variant. When selecting individuals at risk for clinical trials, the Klotho protein level and not only the genetic profile should be considered.",[],JAMA network open,2022-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Grøntvedt', 'firstname': 'Gøril Rolfseng', 'initials': 'GR', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.\nDepartment of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.\nKG Jebsen Centre for Alzheimer's Disease, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Trondheim, Norway.""}, {'lastname': 'Sando', 'firstname': 'Sigrid Botne', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.\nDepartment of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.\nKG Jebsen Centre for Alzheimer's Disease, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Trondheim, Norway.""}, {'lastname': 'Lauridsen', 'firstname': 'Camilla', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Bråthen', 'firstname': 'Geir', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.\nDepartment of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.\nKG Jebsen Centre for Alzheimer's Disease, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Trondheim, Norway.""}, {'lastname': 'White', 'firstname': 'Linda R', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Salvesen', 'firstname': 'Øyvind', 'initials': 'Ø', 'affiliation': 'Unit for Applied Clinical Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Aarsland', 'firstname': 'Dag', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Age-Related Medicine, Stavanger University Hospital, Stavanger, Norway.\nDepartment of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""}, {'lastname': 'Hessen', 'firstname': 'Erik', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Fladby', 'firstname': 'Tormod', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, Campus Ahus, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Waterloo', 'firstname': 'Knut', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Scheffler', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.\nDepartment of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.\nKG Jebsen Centre for Alzheimer's Disease, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Trondheim, Norway.""}]",,,"A total of 243 participants were included: 117 controls (45 men [38.5%]; median age, 65 years [range, 41-84 years]), 102 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (AD-MCI; 59 men [57.8%]; median age, 66 years [range, 46-80 years]), and 24 patients with dementia due to AD (AD-dementia; 12 men [50.0%]; median age, 64.5 years [range, 54-75 years]).

22542837",Association between hearing loss and development of dementia using formal behavioural audiometric testing within the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA): a prospective population-based study.,"Hearing loss has been identified as a potential major modifiable risk factor for developing dementia. This study examined associations between formal behavioural pure-tone and speech audiometry assessed by an audiologist with development of dementia in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA).
The MCSA is a prospective population-based study examining the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA. Participants undergo clinical examinations with neuropsychological testing at enrolment and every 15 months. Participants were 50 years or older at enrolment between Nov 29, 2004, and Dec 23, 2019, who underwent formal behavioural audiometric evaluation by an audiologist due to concerns about hearing loss or as a part of annual comprehensive health assessments. Associations of pure-tone average (PTA) and word recognition scores (WRS) with the development of dementia were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the timescale, and associations with changes in cognitive testing scores over time were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models.
Among 1200 eligible participants, the mean age at enrolment was 79 years (SD 9), 593 (49%) were men, and 207 developed dementia during a mean of 7·0 years (SD 3·7) of follow-up. After adjusting for sex, years of education, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership, and hearing rehabilitation (defined as hearing aid or cochlear implant use), neither PTA (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-decibels hearing level increase of 0·99 (95% CI 0·89-1·12; p=0·91) nor WRS (HR per 10% decrease of 0·98, 95% CI 0·89-1 ·07; p=0·65) was significantly associated with the development of dementia. However, both PTA and WRS were significantly associated with poorer performance in cognitive testing over time: participants with a PTA higher than 25 decibels hearing level or a WRS lower than 100% had significantly worse declines in cognitive testing scores. Informant-based hearing difficulties assessed by the participant's study partner were significantly associated with the development of dementia (HR 1·95, 95% CI 1·45-2·62; p<0·0001).
In this prospective population-based study, subjective informant-based hearing difficulties were associated with development of dementia, whereas objective measures on formal behavioural audiometry were predictive of poorer performance on cognitive testing over time but not the development of dementia.

28559496","Development of a Clinical Risk Score Prediction Tool for 5-, 9-, and 13-Year Risk of Dementia.","Although researchers have devoted substantial efforts, money, and time to studying the causes of dementia and the means to prevent it, no effective treatment exists yet. Identifying preclinical risk factors of dementia could help prevent or delay its progression.
To develop a point risk score prediction model of dementia.
This study used a large UK population-based prospective cohort study conducted between March 13, 2006, and October 1, 2010. Data analysis was performed from June 7 to September 15, 2021. Individual analyses of time end points were concluded at the first dementia diagnosis during the follow-up period. The data were split into training and testing data sets to separately establish and validate a prediction model.
Outcomes of interest included 5-, 9-, and 13-year dementia risk. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify available and practical dementia predictors. A point risk score model was developed for the individual prediction of 5-, 9-, and 13-year dementia risk.
A total of 502 505 participants were selected; the population after exclusions for missing data and dementia diagnosis at baseline was 444 695 (205 187 men; mean [SD] age, 56.74 [8.18] years; 239 508 women; mean [SD] age, 56.20 [8.01] years). Dementia occurrence during the 13 years of follow-up was 0.7% for men and 0.5% for women. The C statistic of the final multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was 0.86 for men and 0.85 for women in the training data set, and 0.85 for men and 0.87 for women in the testing data set. Men and women shared some modifiable risk and protective factors, but they also presented independent risk factors that accounted for 31.7% of men developing dementia and 53.35% of women developing dementia according to the weighted population-attributable fraction. The total point score of the risk score model ranged from -18 to 30 in men and -17 to 30 in women. The risk score model yielded nearly 100% prediction accuracy of 13-year dementia risk both in men and women.
In this diagnostic study, a practical risk score tool was developed for individual prediction of dementia risk, which may help individuals identify their potential risk profile and provide guidance on precise and timely actions to promote dementia delay or prevention.",[],JAMA network open,2022-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Ren', 'firstname': 'Lina', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Shenzhen Mental Health Centre, Shenzhen Kangning Hospital, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Junxian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, China.\nCenter for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Institute of Collaborative Innovation, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wan', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, China.\nCenter for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Institute of Collaborative Innovation, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yongjun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Shenzhen Mental Health Centre, Shenzhen Kangning Hospital, Shenzhen, China.\nCollege of Mental Health and Psychological Science, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dai', 'firstname': 'Xi-Jian', 'initials': 'XJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, China.\nCenter for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Institute of Collaborative Innovation, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, China.\nDepartment of Medical Imaging Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China.'}]",,,"A total of 502 505 participants were selected; the population after exclusions for missing data and dementia diagnosis at baseline was 444 695 (205 187 men; mean [SD] age, 56.74 [8.18] years; 239 508 women; mean [SD] age, 56.20 [8.01] years).

29998294",Characterising heart rhythm abnormalities associated with Xp22.31 deletion.,"Genetic deletions at Xp22.31 are associated with the skin condition X linked ichthyosis (XLI), and with a substantially increased risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF), in males. AF is associated with elevated thrombosis, heart failure, stroke and dementia risk.
Through: (a) examining deletion carriers with a diagnosis of AF in UK Biobank, (b) undertaking an online survey regarding abnormal heart rhythms (AHRs) in men/boys with XLI and female carriers of XLI-associated deletions and (c) screening for association between common genetic variants within Xp22.31 and idiopathic AF-related conditions in UK Biobank, we have investigated how AHRs manifest in deletion carriers, and have identified associated risk factors/comorbidities and candidate gene(s). Finally, we examined attitudes towards heart screening in deletion carriers.
We show that AHRs may affect up to 35% of deletion carriers (compared with <20% of age-matched non-carriers), show no consistent pattern of onset but may be precipitated by stress, and typically resolve quickly and respond well to intervention. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions and asthma/anaemia were the most strongly associated comorbidities in male and female deletion carriers with AHR, respectively. Genetic analysis indicated significant enrichment of common AF risk variants around 
Our data suggest AHRs are frequently associated with Xp22.31 deletion, and highlight subgroups of deletion carriers that may be prioritised for screening. Examining cardiac function further in deletion carriers, and in model systems lacking steroid sulfatase, may clarify AF pathophysiology.","['Anemia', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac', 'Dermatology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Genetic Association Studies']",Journal of medical genetics,2022-11-16,"[{'lastname': 'Wren', 'firstname': 'Georgina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Baker', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Dementia Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.\nMRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics and Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Underwood', 'firstname': 'Jack', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics and Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.\nNeuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Humby', 'firstname': 'Trevor', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.\nMRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics and Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.\nNeuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.\nCardiff and Vale University Health Board, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirov', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics and Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Escott-Price', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics and Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'William', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK daviesw4@cardiff.ac.uk.\nMRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics and Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.\nNeuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.'}]",,"Our data suggest AHRs are frequently associated with Xp22.31 deletion, and highlight subgroups of deletion carriers that may be prioritised for screening.

161,36372727,Plasma Amyloid-β in Relation to Cardiac Function and Risk of Heart Failure in General Population.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) may be related to cardiac function. However, there are limited data on the association of plasma Aβ with cardiac function and risk of heart failure (HF) in the general population.
This study sought to determine the associations of plasma amyloid-β40 (Aβ40) and amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) with echocardiographic measurements of cardiac dysfunction and with incident HF in the general population.
The study included 4,156 participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study (mean age: 71.4 years; 57.1% women), who had plasma Aβ samples collected between 2002 and 2005 and had no established dementia and HF at baseline. Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore the cross-sectional association of plasma Aβ with echocardiographic measures. Participants were followed up until December 2016. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of Aβ levels with incident HF. Models were adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors.
A per 1-SD increase in log-transformed plasma Aβ40 was associated with a 0.39% (95% CI: -0.68 to -0.10) lower left ventricular ejection fraction and a 0.70 g/m
Higher levels of Aβ40 were associated with worse cardiac function and higher risk of new onset HF in the general population, in particular among men.","['amyloid-β40', 'amyloid-β42', 'cardiac function', 'echocardiography', 'heart failure']",JACC.

Prospective cohort study.
Population-based samples of older adults in Gothenburg, Sweden.
Older adults aged 79 and above who participated in any wave of the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies or the Prospective Population Study of Women between 1986 and 2015 (n = 2,438; 1,737 women, 701 men; mean age 86.6).
Most intense level of passive or active suicidal ideation during the past month: life-weariness, wish to die, or active suicidal ideation. The outcome was all-cause mortality over 3 years.
During follow-up, 672 participants (27.6%) died. After adjustments for sex, age, and year of examination, participants who reported a wish to die (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.55-2.60) as the most intense level of ideation, but not participants who reported life-weariness (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.88-2.21) or active suicidal ideation (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.69-1.76) were at increased risk of all-cause mortality. Reporting a wish to die remained associated with mortality in a fully adjusted model, including somatic conditions, dementia, depression, and loneliness (HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.27-2.26).

This cross-sectional study included 6505 participants (55.2% women) of ELSA-Brasil, with a median age of 61 years. The different types of SB considered were sitting time and screen time. The scores obtained in the memory, language, and executive function tests were used to assess cognitive performance (CP). The association between SB and CP was assessed using linear regression.
For men, sitting time was associated with better performance in memory, language, and executive function tests. Screen time on the weekend, showed a favorable association with performance in the executive function test. Occupational screen time on weekdays was positively associated with language test performance. For women, sitting time and occupational screen time were positively associated with performance on memory tests. SB was favorably associated with performance in language tests and executive function tests.
SB seems to favor CP in this population without evident dementia and with a high level of education. The type of SB (mentally active or passive) and the schooling seem to be of particular interest for cognitive performance.","['ELSA-Brasil', 'aging', 'cognition', 'performance', 'sedentary behaviour']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-11-12,"[{'lastname': 'Moreira', 'firstname': 'Pricilla de Almeida', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Instituto de Saúde Coletiva, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador 40220-141, BA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Matos', 'firstname': 'Sheila Maria Alvim de', 'initials': 'SMA', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Instituto de Saúde Coletiva, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador 40220-141, BA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Pitanga', 'firstname': 'Francisco José Gondim', 'initials': 'FJG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education, School of Education, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador 40220-141, BA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Giatti', 'firstname': 'Luana', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Public Health, School of Medicine & Clinical Hospital, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 31270-901, MG, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Barreto', 'firstname': 'Sandhi Maria', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Public Health, School of Medicine & Clinical Hospital, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 31270-901, MG, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Harter Griep', 'firstname': 'Rosane', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Health and Environment Education, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, RJ, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Almeida', 'firstname': 'Maria da Conceição Chagas de', 'initials': 'MDCC', 'affiliation': 'Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador 21045-900, BA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Santos', 'firstname': 'Carlos Antônio de Souza Teles', 'initials': 'CAST', 'affiliation': 'Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador 21045-900, BA, Brazil.'}]",,,"For men, sitting time was associated with better performance in memory, language, and executive function tests.

164,36351662,Associations between salivary testosterone levels and cognitive function among 70-year-old Japanese elderly: A cross-sectional analysis of the SONIC study.,"This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the associations between salivary testosterone concentrations and cognitive function in 70-year-old Japanese elderly people without dementia and stroke.
Participants were 197 Japanese community-dwelling people aged 69-71 years. Their salivary samples were collected, and their cognitive function was assessed using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). Participants were also administered a 10-item recall and a 24-item recognition test. The data for 179 (106 men and 73 women) individuals were analyzed, excluding individuals with a past history of stroke and dementia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed after adjusting for lifestyle factors and analyzing data separately for men and women.
MoCA-J scores showed that men with low testosterone concentrations had a significantly greater risk of low cognitive performance than those with high testosterone concentrations (adjusted odds ratio: 4.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-21.00), while no significant association was found in women. The 10-item recall test scores showed that higher testosterone concentrations were significantly associated with greater recall in the second trial in women (standardized beta = 0.24, P = 0.040), whereas no significant association was found in men. Salivary testosterone concentrations were positively associated with better cognitive performance in older men and women.

34285825",Public knowledge about dementia risk reduction in Norway.,"Several modifiable lifestyle risk factors for dementia have been identified, but it is unclear how much the Norwegian public knows about the relationship between lifestyle and brain health. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate knowledge about modifiable dementia risk and protective factors and beliefs and attitudes towards dementia and dementia risk reduction in a randomly selected subsample of the Norwegian population.
The total sample (n = 1435) included individuals aged 40-70 years from four counties (Oslo, Innlandet, Nordland and Trøndelag) in Norway. Two online questionnaires were used to measure (1) awareness about dementia risk reduction and (2) an individual`s motivation to change behaviour for dementia risk reduction (MOCHAD-10).
Of the participants, 70% were aware of the potential of dementia risk reduction in general. Physical inactivity (86%), cognitive inactivity (84%) and social isolation (80%) were the most frequently recognised dementia risk factors. On the other hand, diabetes (26%), coronary heart disease (19%), hearing loss (18%) and chronic kidney disease (7%) were less often recognised as dementia risk factors. Comparing men and women, the only significant difference was that women were more likely to report parents with dementia as a risk factor compared to men. Gender, age and educational differences were seen in beliefs and attitudes towards dementia prevention:women reported more negative feelings and attitudes towards dementia than men;those aged 40-49 years - more likely than older age groups - reported that 'knowing family members with dementia' or 'having risk factors' made them believe they had to change their lifestyle and behaviour.
The results indicate that 70% of the Norwegian public are aware of the potential for dementia risk reduction in general. However, there are major gaps in existing knowledge, particularly for cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia and metabolic factors (diabetes, obesity). These findings underline the importance of further informing the Norwegian public about lifestyle-related risk and protective factors of dementia. Differences in beliefs and attitudes towards dementia risk prevention by age, gender and education require tailored public risk reduction interventions.","['Awareness', 'Brain health', 'Dementia', 'Lifestyle', 'Prevention', 'Public knowledge', 'Risk factors']",BMC public health,2022-11-09,"[{'lastname': 'Kjelvik', 'firstname': 'Grete', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, PO Box 2136, Tønsberg, 3103, Norway. grete.kjelvik@aldringoghelse.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Rokstad', 'firstname': 'Anne Marie Mork', 'initials': 'AMM', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, PO Box 2136, Tønsberg, 3103, Norway.\nFaculty of Health Sciences and Social Care, Molde University College, Molde, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Stuebs', 'firstname': 'Josephine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, PO Box 2136, Tønsberg, 3103, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Thingstad', 'firstname': 'Pernille', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Movement Science (INB), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.\nDepartment of Health and Welfare, Trondheim Municipality, Trondheim, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Deckers', 'firstname': 'Kay', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Centrum Limburg, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Köhler', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Centrum Limburg, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Selbæk', 'firstname': 'Geir', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, PO Box 2136, Tønsberg, 3103, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,,"Of the participants, 70% were aware of the potential of dementia risk reduction in general.

24634327",Trends in inequalities in the prevalence of dementia in the United States.,"This paper presents estimates of the prevalence of dementia in the United States from 2000 to 2016 by age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, and a measure of lifetime earnings, using data on 21,442 individuals aged 65 y and older and 97,629 person-year observations from a nationally representative survey, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The survey includes a range of cognitive tests, and a subsample underwent clinical assessment for dementia. We developed a longitudinal, latent-variable model of cognitive status, which we estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. This model provides more accurate estimates of dementia prevalence in population subgroups than do previously used methods on the HRS. The age-adjusted prevalence of dementia decreased from 12.2% in 2000 (95% CI, 11.7 to 12.7%) to 8.5% in 2016 (7.9 to 9.1%) in the 65+ population, a statistically significant decline of 3.7 percentage points or 30.1%. Females are more likely to live with dementia, but the sex difference has narrowed. In the male subsample, we found a reduction in inequalities across education, earnings, and racial and ethnic groups; among females, those inequalities also declined, but less strongly. We observed a substantial increase in the level of education between 2000 and 2016 in the sample. This compositional change can explain, in a statistical sense, about 40% of the reduction in dementia prevalence among men and 20% among women, whereas compositional changes in the older population by age, race and ethnicity, and cardiovascular risk factors mattered less.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo', 'longitudinal analysis', 'racial and ethnic inequalities']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Hudomiet', 'firstname': 'Péter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Economics, Sociology, and Statistics Department, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA 90401.'}, {'lastname': 'Hurd', 'firstname': 'Michael D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Economics, Sociology, and Statistics Department, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA 90401.\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138.\nNetwork for Studies on Pensions, Aging and Retirement (NETSPAR), 5037 Tilburg, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Rohwedder', 'firstname': 'Susann', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Economics, Sociology, and Statistics Department, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA 90401.\nNetwork for Studies on Pensions, Aging and Retirement (NETSPAR), 5037 Tilburg, The Netherlands.'}]",,,,,10.1073/pnas.2212205119,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05da4accc0>,,,,,,

24428527",[Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease].,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia in half of the cases. Asthma is usually found in people over 65 years of age. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is multifactorial and includes genetic factors, nutritional disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and aging. Sex hormones have an important influence on the development of AD, as evidenced by a higher incidence in women than in men. Considering the significant influence of T on the maintenance of normal brain function, the present study is aimed at evaluating the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), as well as testosterone therapy, on the risk of AD development and progression. Although there is some clinical inconsistency between studies, androgens have a significant effect on brain function and are beneficial for AD patients. Low levels of circulating androgens should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of AD and memory loss. With a reduced level of T in the plasma of men, its administration improves cognitive performance and memory, treatment should be started at an early stage of the disease. In men and women with AD, androgens improve mental state and slow the progression of the disease, providing a protective effect. In the future, it is necessary to conduct studies on a large population, taking into account personality factors and a more specific approach to assessing cognitive functions and the causal relationship of T administration in AD.
Болезнь Альцгеймера (БА) является нейродегенеративным заболеванием, которое становится причиной деменции в половине случаев ее возникновения. БА, как правило, обнаруживается у людей старше 65 лет. Этиопатогенез заболевания является многофакторным и включает генетические факторы, нарушения питания, митохондриальную дисфункцию, окислительный стресс и старение. Половые гормоны оказывают важное влияние на развитие БА, о чем свидетельствует большая заболеваемость у женщин, чем у мужчин. Учитывая значительное влияние тестостерона (Т) на поддержание нормального функционирования головного мозга, настоящее исследование направлено на оценку влияния андроген-депривационной терапии, а также терапии тестостероном на риск развития и прогрессирования БА. Хотя между исследованиями существует некоторое клиническое несоответствие, андрогены оказывают значительное влияние на функцию головного мозга и полезны для пациентов с БА. Низкие уровни циркулирующих андрогенов следует рассматривать как существенный фактор риска развития БА и потери памяти. При сниженном уровне Т в плазме мужчин его введение способствует повышению когнитивной работоспособности и памяти, лечение следует начинать на ранней стадии заболевания. У мужчин и женщин с БА андрогены улучшают психическое состояние и замедляют прогрессирование заболевания, оказывая протективное действие. В будущем необходимо проведение исследований на большой популяции с учетом факторов индивидуальности и более конкретным подходом к оценке когнитивных функций и причинной-следственной связи введения Т при БА.",[],Problemy endokrinologii,2022-11-08,"[{'lastname': 'Kuznetsov', 'firstname': 'K O', 'initials': 'KO', 'affiliation': 'N.I.

34759373",Heart rate variability and cognitive performance in adults with cardiovascular risk.,"Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, has been associated with both cardiovascular disease and cognitive dysfunction. In turn, cardiovascular risk has been linked to an increased risk of dementia onset. However, whether autonomic dysfunction may represent an early marker of cognitive decline in individuals with high cardiovascular risk is still an open issue.
We performed a complete 24-hour HRV analysis in 50 middle-aged and elderly subjects with cardiovascular risk as assessed with the European Society of Cardiology Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (ESC SCORE). Cognitive performance was evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and Stroop Color and Word Test. Stepwise regression was used to identify significant associations between 24-hour ambulatory ECGs parameters and cognitive performances.
There were 30 women and 20 men with mean age of 64.9 years (range 51-77) and the mean ESC SCORE was 6%. Four subjects were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.

35611968","Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Population Attributable Risk of Dementia Associated with Traumatic Brain Injury in Civilians and Veterans.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an established risk factor for dementia. However, the magnitude of risk is highly variable across studies. Identification of sub-populations at highest risk, with careful consideration of potential sources of bias, is urgently needed to guide public health policy and research into mechanisms and treatments. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk of all-cause dementia after all-severity TBI. We assessed for effect of participant age and sex, veteran status, research methods, and region. The search window covered January 1990 to January 2019. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Data were pooled using random effects models. Population attributable risk (PAR) of dementia due to TBI in the U.S. was calculated by sex and veteran status. Pooled risk ratio (RR) for dementia after TBI was 1.66 (95% confidence interval 1.42-1.93). Younger age, male sex, and studies from Asia were associated with significantly higher risk; veteran status was not. Risk of dementia associated with ""head injury/trauma"" was not significantly different from that associated with ""TBI"" diagnosis specifically. PAR of dementia due to TBI among U.S. veterans was twice that of the general U.S. population, largely due to the high prevalence of TBI exposure in the majority male veteran population. This meta-analysis found that TBI is associated with nearly 70% increased risk of dementia. Risk may be highest among younger adults, men, and cohorts in Asia. Efforts to prevent TBI and also to prevent post-TBI dementia are of high importance. Additionally, improved methods for diagnosing and tracking TBI on a public health level, such as national registries, may improve the quality and generalizability of future epidemiological studies investigating the association between TBI and dementia.","['dementia', 'systematic review', 'traumatic brain injury', 'veterans']",Journal of neurotrauma,2022-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Gardner', 'firstname': 'Raquel C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.\nJoseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Bahorik', 'firstname': 'Amber', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kornblith', 'firstname': 'Erica S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Allen', 'firstname': 'Isabel Elaine', 'initials': 'IE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Plassman', 'firstname': 'Brenda L', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yaffe', 'firstname': 'Kristine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1089/neu.2022.0041

15778708",Association of Vascular Risk Factors and Genetic Factors With Penetrance of Variants Causing Monogenic Stroke.,"It is uncertain whether typical variants causing monogenic stroke are associated with cerebrovascular disease in the general population and why the phenotype of these variants varies so widely.
To determine the frequency of pathogenic variants in the 3 most common monogenic cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD) and their associations with prevalent and incident stroke and dementia.
This cohort study is a multicenter population-based study of data from UK Biobank participants recruited in 2006 through 2010, with the latest follow-up in September 2021. A total of 9.2 million individuals aged 40 to 69 years who lived in the United Kingdom were invited to join UK Biobank, of whom 5.5% participated in the baseline assessment. Participants eligible for our study (n = 454 756, excluding 48 569 with incomplete data) had whole-exome sequencing and available data pertaining to lacunar stroke-related diseases, namely stroke, dementia, migraine, and epilepsy.
NOTCH3, HTRA1, and COL4A1/2 pathogenic variants in monogenic stroke; Framingham cardiovascular risk; and ischemic stroke polygenic risk.
Primary outcomes were prevalent and incident stroke and dementia. Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, exome sequencing batch, and top 10 genetic principal components.
Of the 454 756 participants (208 027 [45.8%] men; mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years), 973 participants carried NOTCH3 variants, 546 carried HTRA1 variants, and 336 carried COL4A1/2 variants. Variant carriers were at least 66% more likely to have had stroke. NOTCH3 carriers had increased vascular dementia risk (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 3.11-8.74), HTRA1 carriers an increased all-cause dementia risk (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.28-3.41), and COL4A1/2 carriers an increased intracerebral hemorrhage risk (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.34-7.53). NOTCH3 variants were associated with incident ischemic stroke and vascular dementia. NOTCH3 and HTRA1 variants were associated with magnetic resonance imaging markers of cSVD. Cardiovascular risk burden was associated with increased stroke risk in NOTCH3 and HTRA1 carriers. Variant location was also associated with risk.
In this cohort study, pathogenic variants associated with rare monogenic stroke were more common than expected in the general population and associated with stroke and dementia. Cardiovascular risk burden is associated with the penetrance of such variants. Our results support the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk factor control may improve disease prognosis in individuals with monogenic cSVD variants. This lays the foundation for future studies to evaluate the effect of early identification before symptom onset on mitigating stroke and dementia risk.",[],JAMA neurology,2022-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Bernard P H', 'initials': 'BPH', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Harshfield', 'firstname': 'Eric L', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Thani', 'firstname': 'Maha', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Tozer', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Bell', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Markus', 'firstname': 'Hugh S', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Stroke Research Group, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}]",,,"Of the 454 756 participants (208 027 [45.8%] men; mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years), 973 participants carried NOTCH3 variants, 546 carried HTRA1 variants, and 336 carried COL4A1/2 variants.

33844047","Global, regional, and national burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, 1990-2019.","With the increase in the aging population worldwide, Alzheimer's disease has become a rapidly increasing public health concern. Monitoring the dementia disease burden will support health development strategies by providing scientific data.
Based on the data obtained from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, the numbers and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias from 1990 to 2019 were analyzed. Calculated estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) and Joinpoint regression analyses were performed to evaluate the trends during this period. We also evaluated the correlations between the epidemiology and the sociodemographic index (SDI), an indicator to evaluate the level of social development in a country or region considering the education rate, economic situation, and total fertility rate.
From 1990 to 2019, the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias increased by 147.95 and 160.84%, respectively. The ASR of incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs in both men and women consistently increased over the study period. All the ASRs in women were consistently higher than those in men, but the increases were more pronounced in men. In addition, the ASRs of incidence, prevalence, and DALYs were positively correlated with the SDI. Moreover, the proportion of patients over 70 years old with dementia was also positively correlated with the SDI level. Smoking was a major risk factor for the disease burden of dementia in men, while obesity was the major risk factor for women.
From 1990 to 2019, the Alzheimer's disease burden increased worldwide. This trend was more serious in high-SDI areas, especially among elderly populations in high-SDI areas, who should receive additional attention. Policy-makers should take steps to reverse this situation. Notably, women were at a higher risk for the disease, but the risk in men showed a faster increase. We should give attention to the aging population, attach importance to interventions targeting dementia risk factors, and formulate action plans to address the increasing incidence of dementia.","[""Alzheimer's disease and other dementias"", 'Global Burden of Disease', 'age-standardized rate (ASR)', 'estimated annual percentage change', 'risk factors']",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xue', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.\nDepartment of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.\nDepartment of Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Xiaojin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.\nDepartment of Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Xiaodong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.\nDepartment of Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Ningning', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.\nDepartment of Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Fang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yongping', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.\nDepartment of Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.'}]",,"From 1990 to 2019, the Alzheimer's disease burden increased worldwide.

173,36281678,Sex-Driven Differences in the Effectiveness of Individualized Clinical Management of Alzheimer's Disease Risk.,"The Comparative Effectiveness Dementia and Alzheimer's Registry (CEDAR) trial demonstrated that individualized, multi-domain interventions improved cognition and reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As biological sex is a significant risk factor for AD, it is essential to explore the differential effectiveness of targeted clinical interventions in women vs. men.
Patients were recruited from an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic. Subjects with normal cognition, subjective cognitive decline, or asymptomatic preclinical AD were classified as ""Prevention"". Subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD were classified as ""Early Treatment."" The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 18-months on the modified-Alzheimer's Prevention Cognitive Composite. Secondary outcomes included a cognitive aging composite, AD and cardiovascular (CV) risk scales, and serum biomarkers. Subjects who adhered to > 60% of recommendations in the CEDAR trial were included in this a priori sub-group analysis to examine whether individualized intervention effects were modified by sex (n=80).
In the Prevention group, both women (p=0.0205) and men (p=0.0044) demonstrated improvements in cognition with no sex differences (p=0.5244). In the Early Treatment group, there were also no significant sex differences in cognition (p=0.3299). In the Prevention group, women demonstrated greater improvements in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis risk score (MESA-RS) than men (difference=1.5, p=0.0013). Women in the Early Treatment group demonstrated greater improvements in CV Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) risk score (difference=2.3, p=0.0067), and the MESA-RS (difference=4.1, p<0.001).
Individualized multi-domain interventions are equally effective at improving cognition in women and men. However, personally-tailored interventions led to greater improvements in calculated AD and CV risk, and CV blood biomarkers, in women compared to men. Future study in larger cohorts is necessary to further define sex differences in AD risk reduction in clinical practice.","['Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'precision medicine', 'sex-driven differences']",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2022-10-26,"[{'lastname': 'Saif', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Richard S.

35355306",Factors Associated With Severe COVID-19 Among Vaccinated Adults Treated in US Veterans Affairs Hospitals.,"With a large proportion of the US adult population vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to identify who remains at risk of severe infection despite vaccination.
To characterize risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in a vaccinated population.
This nationwide, retrospective cohort study included US veterans who received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination series and later developed laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were treated at US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. Data were collected from December 15, 2020, through February 28, 2022.
Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, immunocompromised status, and vaccination-related variables.
Development of severe vs nonsevere SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe disease was defined as hospitalization within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test and either blood oxygen level of less than 94%, receipt of supplemental oxygen or dexamethasone, mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days. Association between severe disease and exposures was estimated using logistic regression models.
Among 110 760 patients with infections following vaccination (97 614 [88.1%] men, mean [SD] age at vaccination, 60.8 [15.3] years; 26 953 [24.3%] Black, 11 259 [10.2%] Hispanic, and 71 665 [64.7%] White), 10 612 (9.6%) had severe COVID-19. The strongest association with risk of severe disease after vaccination was age, which increased among patients aged 50 years or older with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.42 (CI, 1.40-1.44) per 5-year increase in age, such that patients aged 80 years or older had an aOR of 16.58 (CI, 13.49-20.37) relative to patients aged 45 to 50 years. Immunocompromising conditions, including receipt of different classes of immunosuppressive medications (eg, leukocyte inhibitor: aOR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.39-3.28) or cytotoxic chemotherapy (aOR, 2.71; CI, 2.27-3.24) prior to breakthrough infection, or leukemias or lymphomas (aOR, 1.87; CI, 1.61-2.17) and chronic conditions associated with end-organ disease, such as heart failure (aOR, 1.74; CI, 1.61-1.88), dementia (aOR, 2.01; CI, 1.83-2.20), and chronic kidney disease (aOR, 1.59; CI, 1.49-1.69), were also associated with increased risk. Receipt of an additional (ie, booster) dose of vaccine was associated with reduced odds of severe disease (aOR, 0.50; CI, 0.44-0.57).
In this nationwide, retrospective cohort of predominantly male US Veterans, we identified risk factors associated with severe disease despite vaccination. Findings could be used to inform outreach efforts for booster vaccinations and to inform clinical decision-making about patients most likely to benefit from preexposure prophylaxis and antiviral therapy.",[],JAMA network open,2022-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Vo', 'firstname': 'Austin D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'La', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Julie T-Y', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'VA Palo Alto Healthcare System, Palo Alto, California.\nStanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Strymish', 'firstname': 'Judith M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.\nHarvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Ronan', 'firstname': 'Matthew', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Brophy', 'firstname': 'Mary', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, Massachusetts.\nDepartment of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.\nBoston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Do', 'firstname': 'Nhan V', 'initials': 'NV', 'affiliation': 'VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, Massachusetts.\nDepartment of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.\nBoston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Branch-Elliman', 'firstname': 'Westyn', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, Massachusetts.\nDepartment of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.\nHarvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.\nVA Boston Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Fillmore', 'firstname': 'Nathanael R', 'initials': 'NR', 'affiliation': 'VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, Massachusetts.\nDepartment of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.\nHarvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.\nDana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Monach', 'firstname': 'Paul A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, Massachusetts.\nDepartment of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.\nHarvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.'}]",,,"Among 110 760 patients with infections following vaccination (97 614 [88.1%] men, mean [SD] age at vaccination, 60.8 [15.3] years; 26 953 [24.3%] Black, 11 259 [10.2%] Hispanic, and 71 665 [64.7%] White), 10 612 (9.6%) had severe COVID-19.

175,36259584,Sex-Specific Associations of Dietary Iron Intake with Brain Iron Deposition on Imaging and Incident Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"The study aimed to evaluate the association of dietary iron intake with incident dementia and brain iron deposition.
We included dementia-free participants from the UK Biobank who completed at least one 24-hour dietary recall at study baseline (2009-2012) and were followed up to 2021. Incident dementia was determined through linkage to medical records and death registries. Brain MRI was conducted in a subgroup of participants since 2014, with T2* measurements being used as indicators of brain iron deposition.
Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the associations of high (top quintile) and low (bottom quintile) versus medium (quintile 2 to 4) level of dietary iron intake with incident dementia, respectively. Linear regression was applied to assess the relations between dietary iron intake and brain T2* measurements.
During follow-up (mean = 9.5 years), a total of 1,454 participants (650 women and 804 men) developed dementia among 191,694 participants (55.0% female; mean age, 56.2 years). When adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and other dietary factors, participants with low dietary iron intake (&lt; 10.05 mg/day) had a significantly higher dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.89), while the relation for high intake (&gt; 16.92 mg/day) was non-significant (HR, 1.16, 95% CI, 0.92-1.46). A significant gender difference (P-interaction &lt; 0.001) was observed, with a U-shaped association in male participants (HR for low vs. medium, 1.56, 95% CI, 1.14-2.13; HR for high vs. medium, 1.39, 95% CI, 1.03 - 1.88; P-nonlinearity &lt; 0.001) and no significant association in females, regardless of their menopause status. In general, dietary iron intake was not related to T2* measurements of iron deposition in most brain regions.
Our findings suggested a U-shape relationship between dietary iron intake and risk of dementia among males, but not females.","['Dementia', 'cohort study', 'dietary iron', 'healthy aging']","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2022-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Pan', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Min Yang, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 866 Yu-hang-tang RD, Hangzhou, China, Tel: 13516852440, ymin36@zju.edu.cn; Changzheng Yuan, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 866 Yu-hang-tang RD, Hangzhou, China, Tel: 17326860291, E-mail: chy478@zju.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ni', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zong', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Our findings suggested a U-shape relationship between dietary iron intake and risk of dementia among males, but not females.","During follow-up (mean = 9.5 years), a total of 1,454 participants (650 women and 804 men) developed dementia among 191,694 participants (55.0% female; mean age, 56.2 years).

176,36241548,The effect of occupation on the incidence of vascular dementia: A 12-year follow-up cohort study.,"Vascular dementia (DV) is the second cause of dementia with 15.8-20% of cases. Previous studies of the effect of occupation in DV do not show conclusive results, therefore, the objective was to analyze if the type of occupation can vary the risk of developing DV in those older than 55 years.
In the ZARADEMP project, a community sample of 4,803 individuals were followed longitudinally in four waves. The occupation was classified following the National Classification of Occupations (CNO-11) and the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08). Different standardized instruments were used: the medical and psychiatric histories (History and Aetiology Schedule) and other risk factors (Mini-Mental Status Examination, Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT). For this study, we calculated incidence rates, incidence rate ratios and hazard ratios in multivariate Cox regression models, stratified by gender. For this study, we included 3,883 participants.
In women, the risk of DV was doubled in Blue-collar workers, with a moderate effect (Cohen's d=0.54) and multiplying by 2.7 in Homeworks respect to White Collar with a moderate effect (Cohen's d=0.77), although they did not reach statistical significance. We did not observe the effect of occupation on the risk of DV in men.
We have found a moderate but non-significant effect between occupation and DV risk in women. We found no effect of occupation on the risk of VD in males while other clinical factors (age, diabetes or body mass index) presented a clearer effect than the occupation.","['Demencia vascular', 'Diferencias de género', 'Epidemiology', 'Epidemiología', 'Factor de riesgo', 'Gender differences', 'Occupation', 'Ocupación', 'Risk factor', 'Vascular dementia']",Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental,2022-10-15,"[{'lastname': 'Gracia-Rebled', 'firstname': 'Ana Cristina', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Fisiatría y Enfermería, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.

11078110","Prevalence of medical factors related to aging among older car drivers: a multicenter, cross-sectional, descriptive study.","An increasing number of older adults in Japan are at an increased risk of road traffic crashes. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of potential underlying medical factors that increase the risk of road traffic crashes among older people.
This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in 11 medical institutions in Japan using self-administered questionnaires and physical examination from January to May 2021. The background and social data, data on the use of nursing care insurance, and clinical data suggestive of polypharmacy, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and frailty/oral frailty were obtained. The prevalence of these factors was compared between everyday and occasional drivers.
Data of 127 patients were collected; their median (interquartile range) age was 73 (70-78) years. Of the total participants, 82 were men (64.6%) and 45 were women (35.4%). There were 77 everyday drivers and 50 occasional drivers. Of these, 121 (95.3%) had not applied for nursing care insurance, but the numbers of those who required help 1 and 2 were 1 (0.8%) and 3 (2.4%), respectively.

Measures of amyloid (Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40), phospho-tau (ptau181), and total tau (t-tau) were determined from CSF samples obtained at baseline from participants in an ongoing longitudinal project, known as the Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Alzheimer Disease study (BIOCARD) study. The fully automated, Lumipulse G immunoassay was used to analyze the specimens. Cox regression models were used to examine the relationship of baseline biomarker levels with time to symptom onset of MCI and interactions with age, sex, and 
Analyses included 273 participants from the BIOCARD cohort, who were cognitively normal and predominantly middle-aged at baseline, and have been followed for an average of 16 years (max = 23.6). During follow-up, 94 progressed to MCI (median time to symptom onset = 6.9 years). In Cox regression models, elevated ptau181 and t-tau levels were associated with time to MCI symptom onset if it occurred within 7 years of baseline (HR 1.386 and 1.329;

179,36215395,Correlation of Global and Regional Amyloid Burden by 18 F-Florbetaben PET/CT With Cognitive Impairment Profile and Severity.,"To assess the correlation between profile and severity deterioration in the neuropsychological assessment and the most affected regions in amyloid PET semiquantification. The influence of vascular risk and other potential confounding factors was also evaluated.
A retrospective, observational, and multicenter study including all patients referred for amyloid PET in daily practice was conducted. Patients underwent neuropsychological assessment, and cognitive decline severity and domain(s) affected were recorded. The patients were grouped according to cognitive impairment (CI) profile and severity: (A) no CI, single-domain amnestic CI, multiple-domain amnestic CI, and nonamnestic CI; and (B) mild CI, moderate and severe dementia. An adapted Framingham Stroke Risk Profile was calculated for each individual. Depression and parkinsonism were also recorded. Standardized quantitative analysis software was used to obtain standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values from PET/CT images. The corresponding associations were assessed with the most appropriate statistical tests.
One hundred twenty-nine patients were included (62 men, 67 women; 64.67 ± 7.47 years old). Significant differences in global and regional amyloid load were exclusively found in women between non-CI and moderate dementia ( P = 0.006, for total-cerebellum SUVR). Posterior and anterior cingulates and prefrontal cortex best represented CI severity ( P = 0.003, 0.006, and 0.006, respectively). No relationship between the CI profile and the regional amyloid load was shown. A significantly high positive correlation was found between age and vascular risk and between these variables and amyloid load in nearly all regions, especially in women with moderate dementia.

Whether diet is associated with dementia remains largely unknown. We tested if low adherence to established dietary guidelines is associated with elevated lipids and lipoproteins and with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's dementia – a dementia subtype with a high frequency of cardiovascular risk factors.

34591543",Weak Social Networks in Late Life Predict Incident Alzheimer's Disease: The Kuakini Honolulu-Asia Aging Study.,"We assessed 10-year longitudinal associations between late-life social networks and incidence of all-cause dementia (ACD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) in Japanese-American men.
We prospectively analyzed, from baseline (1991-1993) through 1999-2000, 2636 initially nondemented Kuakini Honolulu-Asia Aging Study participants who remained dementia-free during the first 3 years of follow-up. Global cognition was evaluated by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI); depressive symptoms by the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale; and social networks by the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS). Median split of LSNS scores defined weak/strong social network groups. A panel of neurologists and geriatricians diagnosed and classified dementia; AD and VaD diagnoses comprised cases in which AD or VaD, respectively, were considered the primary cause of dementia.
Median (range) baseline age was 77 (71-93) years. Participants with weak (LSNS score ≤29) versus strong (>29) social networks had higher age-adjusted incidence (in person-years) of ACD (12.6 vs. 8.7; p = .014) and AD (6.7 vs. 4.0; p = .007) but not VaD (2.4 vs. 1.4; p = .15). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a lower likelihood of survival free of ACD (log-rank p < .0001) and AD (p = .0006) for men with weak networks.

23154746",Quadratic relationship between systolic blood pressure and white matter lesions in individuals with hypertension.,"There is a well documented relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and the development of brain injury, which can lead to cognitive dysfunction. Hypertension (HTN) is a condition increasing the risk of silent and symptomatic ischemic brain lesions. Although benefits of hypertension treatment are indisputable, the target blood pressure value where the possibility of tissue damage is most reduced remains under debate.
Our group performed a cross-sectional ( n  = 376) and longitudinal ( n  = 188) study of individuals without dementia or stroke (60% women n  = 228, age 68.5 ± 7.4 years; men n  = 148, age 70.7 ± 6.9 years). Participants were split into hypertensive ( n  = 169) and normotensive ( n  = 207) groups. MR images were obtained on a 3T system. Linear modeling was performed in hypertensive and normotensive cohorts to investigate the relationship between systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, white matter lesion (WML), and brain volumes.
Participants in the hypertensive cohort showed a quadratic relationship between SBP and WML, with the lowest amounts of WML being measured in participants with readings at approximately 124 mmHg. Additionally, the hypertensive cohort also exhibited a quadratic relationship between DBP and mean hippocampal volume; participants with readings at approximately 77 mmHg showing the largest volumes. Longitudinally, all groups experienced WML growth, despite different BP trajectories, further suggesting that WML expansion may occur despite or because of BP reduction in individuals with compromised vascular system.
Overall, our study suggests that in the hypertensive group there is a valley of mid-range blood pressures displaying less pathology in the brain.",[],Journal of hypertension,2022-10-08,"[{'lastname': 'Woldstad', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Rusinek', 'firstname': 'Henry', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, NYU School of Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Sweeney', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Butler', 'firstname': 'Tracy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanzi', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Mardy', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Harvey', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'de Leon', 'firstname': 'Mony J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.'}, {'lastname': 'Glodzik', 'firstname': 'Lidia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.'}]","Our group performed a cross-sectional ( n  = 376) and longitudinal ( n  = 188) study of individuals without dementia or stroke (60% women n  = 228, age 68.5 ± 7.4 years; men n  = 148, age 70.7 ± 6.9 years).

183,36192177,Risk of Neurodegenerative Diseases in Patients With Acromegaly: A Cohort Study.,"A few recent studies have reported an association between insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and neurodegenerative disease, but there was no report on any association between acromegaly and neurodegenerative disease. We investigated whether the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases was increased among patients with acromegaly using nationwide data of Korea.
We studied the association between acromegaly and Parkinson disease and dementia in 1,611 patients with acromegaly and controls (age-matched and sex-matched 8,055 participants with no diagnosis of acromegaly) from the National Health Insurance System database between 2006 and 2016 with a mean follow-up period of 7.34 years. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the risk of all outcomes in patients with acromegaly compared with controls with adjusting for age, sex, household income, place, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
The average age of the patients with acromegaly and the controls was 54.16 years (40.4% men). The incidence rate of Parkinson disease in patients with acromegaly (1.54 per 1,000 person-years) was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.55 per 1,000 person-years) (log-rank test

184,36189592,The Differential Effect of Schooling and Physical Activity on Dementia in Older Women and Men from Brazil: Implications for Policymaking.,"Modifiable risk factors exert crucial impact on dementia.
We sought to answer the question: do two modifiable risk factors, schooling level and physical activity (PA), affect cognitive function similarly in each sex?
This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 and 2021, and the survey was applied to the residents of the metropolitan area of Santos, a seashore of Sao Paulo State. Four hundred and twenty-two participants (women = 254 and men = 168) were eligible. Baecke questionnaire for the elderly was applied for the classification as physically inactive (PI) or active (PA). Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Participants were also stratified by schooling status for both sexes.
Higher education had a sex-independent positive influence on MMSE and CDR (p < 0.001). PA influences positively MMSE in older women (PI: 25±5 and PA: 27±3, p < 0.03), but has no effect in older men (26±5 and 25±5, p > 0.05). Concordantly, older women who were PA (1.7 and 0 %) showed a lower prevalence of dementia compared with PI (6.2 and 2.1%), for mild and moderate respectively. Active older women had higher odds of improving the MMSE score (OR: 1.093; 95% CI: 1.008-1.186) than men (OR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.896-1.051).
Education affects cognitive function equally in Brazilian elderly whereas older women are more responsive to the beneficial effects of PA for dementia than men.","['Cognitive function', 'physical activity', 'schooling status', 'sex difference']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Souza', 'firstname': 'Melyssa Alves', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Postgraduate Program in Environmental Health, Metropolitan University of Santos (UNIMES), Santos, SP, Brazil.\nDepartment of Biosciences, Institute of Health and Society, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Santos, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Peres Bomfim', 'firstname': 'Larissa Gomes', 'initials': 'LG', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Postgraduate Program in Environmental Health, Metropolitan University of Santos (UNIMES), Santos, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Barros', 'firstname': 'Vinicius Lúcio', 'initials': 'VL', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Postgraduate Program in Environmental Health, Metropolitan University of Santos (UNIMES), Santos, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Medeiros', 'firstname': 'Reinaldo Coelho', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Postgraduate Program in Environmental Health, Metropolitan University of Santos (UNIMES), Santos, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ginsicke', 'firstname': 'Danielle Cristine', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Postgraduate Program in Environmental Health, Metropolitan University of Santos (UNIMES), Santos, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Colovati', 'firstname': 'Mileny Esbravatti Stephano', 'initials': 'MES', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Postgraduate Program in Environmental Health, Metropolitan University of Santos (UNIMES), Santos, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Daly', 'firstname': 'Timothy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Sorbonne Université, Science Norms Democracy, UMR 8011, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Zanesco', 'firstname': 'Angelina', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, Postgraduate Program in Environmental Health, Metropolitan University of Santos (UNIMES), Santos, SP, Brazil.'}]",,Education affects cognitive function equally in Brazilian elderly whereas older women are more responsive to the beneficial effects of PA for dementia than men.,"Higher education had a sex-independent positive influence on MMSE and CDR (p < 0.001).

15179909",Living Alone During Old Age and the Risk of Dementia: Assessing the Cumulative Risk of Living Alone.,"This study examines the association between living alone during old age and dementia. Whereas most previous studies on this topic utilize measures of living alone status that were obtained at a single point in time, we compare this typical approach to one that measures long-term exposure to living alone among older adults and assesses whether dementia is more likely to occur within individuals with more accumulated time living alone.
Data come from the Health and Retirement Study, with a follow-up period of 2000-2018. A total of 18,171 older adults were followed during this period, resulting in 78,490 person-waves analyzed in a series of multi-level logistic models. Contemporaneous living alone was recorded when a respondent's household size was equal to 1 in a given wave. Cumulative living alone was calculated by adding the number of living alone statuses up to a given wave.
Contemporaneous living alone was either not associated (male-only subsample), or inversely associated (female-only subsample) with dementia. By contrast, a one-unit (i.e., one wave) increase in cumulative living alone was associated with about a 10% increase in the odds of dementia for both men (odds ratio [OR] = 1.111) and women (OR = 1.088), net of several covariates, including marital status, age, social activities, and social support.
Living alone during late life is an important risk factor for dementia, but the cognitive effects of solitary living probably do not take hold immediately for most older adults and potentially demonstrate a dose-response relationship.","['Cognitive impairment', 'Living arrangements', 'Social isolation']","The journals of gerontology.

186,36173383,Hypertension differentially impacts cognition in men and women in early midlife.,"The current study aimed to understand how sex differences in the timing of hypertension onset contribute to early midlife risk for cognitive decline that may differ by sex and whether sex-dependent advantages in normotensive populations are influenced by the presence of hypertension. One hundred and ninety-five adults aged 45-55 from the New England Family Study underwent neuropsychological testing to assess attention, executive function, and memory. Physician-diagnosed hypertension status was self-reported via questionnaire. Mid-adulthood hypertension was associated with worse performance on measures of attention and memory, but the cognitive domains impacted varied by sex. Hypertension was associated with only attention in men, whereas in women it was associated with attention and associative and working memory. Sex differences in midlife cognitive performance found in normotensive adults were attenuated in those with hypertension. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for sex when assessing the impact of hypertension on midlife cognition that could be indicative of later decline and risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, given hypertension is an independent risk factor.","['cognition', 'hypertension', 'memory', 'midlife', 'sex differences']",Journal of neuropsychology,2022-09-30,"[{'lastname': 'Shields', 'firstname': 'Hannah L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory for Sex Differences in the Brain, Innovation Center on Sex Differences in Medicine (ICON-X), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nAlzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Center, Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Konishi', 'firstname': 'Kyoko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory for Sex Differences in the Brain, Innovation Center on Sex Differences in Medicine (ICON-X), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aroner', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory for Sex Differences in the Brain, Innovation Center on Sex Differences in Medicine (ICON-X), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aizley', 'firstname': 'Harlyn', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory for Sex Differences in the Brain, Innovation Center on Sex Differences in Medicine (ICON-X), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Remington', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory for Sex Differences in the Brain, Innovation Center on Sex Differences in Medicine (ICON-X), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Hang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Biostatistics Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Buka', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldstein', 'firstname': 'Jill M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory for Sex Differences in the Brain, Innovation Center on Sex Differences in Medicine (ICON-X), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}]",,,,© 2022 The British Psychological Society.,10.1111/jnp.12291,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dedd07c0>,,,,,,

21974976",Association between cortisol and aging-related hippocampus volume changes in community-dwelling older adults: a 7-year follow-up study.,"Identifying peripheral biomarkers related to modifiable risk factors to prevent dementia at an early stage will be extremely beneficial. We have been studying how older adults can maintain their mental health and continue to live in a familiar community. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between serum cortisol levels and brain volume among older adults in rural Japan.
This was a longitudinal study conducted in Kurokawa-cho, Imari, Saga Prefecture, Japan, among people aged 65 years and above, as reported previously. We conducted a survey twice. The first survey was conducted from October 2009 to March 2011 (Timepoint 1) and the second was conducted from November 2016 to September 2017 (Timepoint 2). Blood samples for serum cortisol levels analysis were collected from participants at Timepoint 1. Serum cortisol levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The participants underwent brain MRI examinations, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) for cognitive function assessment at Timepoint 1 and Timepoint 2. We obtained 70 participants (16 men, mean age 72.69 ± 3.18 years; 54 women, mean age 72.69 ± 4.60 years, at Timepoint 1) for analysis. Correlation analysis was performed between serum cortisol levels at baseline (Timepoint 1) and brain volume (Timepoint 1, Timepoint 2, and Timepoint 1-Timepoint 2 difference) using voxel-based morphometry method.
There was no significant difference in serum cortisol levels between men (72.32 ± 17.30 ng/ml) and women (76.60 ± 21.12 ng/ml) at baseline. Additionally, no effect of blood collection time on cortisol levels was observed in these participants. Small volume correction analysis at the cluster level by applying multiple comparison corrections (family-wise error; P < 0.05) showed a negative correlation between serum cortisol levels (Timepoint 1) and brain volume (Timepoint 2) within the region containing the left hippocampus.
Serum cortisol levels may serve as a peripheral biomarker of age-related volume changes involving the hippocampus in older adults aged 65 years and above.","['Cognitive function', 'Cortisol', 'Hippocampus', 'MRI', 'Voxel-based morphometry']",BMC geriatrics,2022-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Orihashi', 'firstname': 'Ryuzo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, 1-1 Idaigaoka, Hasama-machi, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Imamura', 'firstname': 'Yoshiomi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.\nInstitute of Comparative Studies of International Cultures and Societies, Kurume University, 1635 Mii-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka, 839-8502, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamada', 'firstname': 'Shigeto', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""St. Lucia's Hospital, 1012 Tsubukumotomachi, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0047, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Monji', 'firstname': 'Akira', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Mizoguchi', 'firstname': 'Yoshito', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan. ymizo@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.'}]",,,"There was no significant difference in serum cortisol levels between men (72.32 ± 17.30 ng/ml) and women (76.60 ± 21.12 ng/ml) at baseline.

29621480","Association of Multimorbidity, Disease Clusters, and Modification by Genetic Factors With Risk of Dementia.","Individual conditions have been identified as risk factors for dementia; however, it is important to consider the role of multimorbidity, as conditions often co-occur.
To investigate whether multimorbidity is associated with incident dementia and whether associations vary by different clusters of disease and genetic risk for dementia.
This population-based prospective cohort study used data from the UK Biobank cohort, with baseline data collected between 2006 and 2010 and with up to 15 years of follow-up. Participants included women and men without dementia and aged at least 60 years at baseline. Medical conditions were captured as part of nurse-led verbal interviews conducted at baseline assessment centers. Data were analyzed from October 2020 to July 2022.
The presence of at least 2 long-term conditions from a preselected list of 42 conditions was used to define multimorbidity. High genetic risk for dementia was based on presence of 1 or 2 apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 alleles.
The main outcome, incident dementia, was derived from hospital inpatient and death registry records. Associations of multimorbidity with dementia were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models.
A total of 206 960 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [2.9] years, 108 982 [52.7%] women) were included in the final sample, of whom 89 201 participants (43.1%) had multimorbidity. Over a mean (SD) of 11.8 (2.2) years of follow-up, 6182 participants (3.0%) developed dementia. The incidence rate was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.80-1.94) per 1000 person-years for those without multimorbidity and 3.41 (95% CI, 3.30-3.53) per 1000 person-years for those with multimorbidity. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, and APOE-ε4 carrier status, multimorbidity was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.55-1.71]). The highest dementia risk was observed for the hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease cluster (HR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.98-2.46]) and pain, osteoporosis, and dyspepsia cluster (HR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.68-2.37]) in women and in the diabetes and hypertension cluster (HR, 2.24 [95% CI, 1.97-2.55]) and coronary heart disease, hypertension, and stroke cluster (HR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.71-2.20]) in men, compared with no multimorbidity. The associations between multimorbidity and dementia were greater in those with a lower genetic risk of dementia (HR, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.81-2.11]) than in those with a higher genetic risk of dementia (HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.30-1.49]). Similar findings were observed when stratifying diseases clusters by genetic risk for dementia.
These findings suggest that multimorbidity was associated with an increased risk of dementia. The associations varied by clusters of disease and genetic risk for dementia. These findings could help with the identification of individuals at high risk of dementia as well as the development of targeted interventions to reduce or delay dementia incidence.",[],JAMA network open,2022-09-21,"[{'lastname': 'Calvin', 'firstname': 'Catherine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Conroy', 'firstname': 'Megan C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'Sarah F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuzma', 'firstname': 'Elzbieta', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Albertinen-Haus Centre for Geriatrics and Gerontology, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Littlejohns', 'firstname': 'Thomas J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}]",,,"A total of 206 960 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [2.9] years, 108 982 [52.7%] women) were included in the final sample, of whom 89 201 participants (43.1%) had multimorbidity.

189,36113230,Association between daily sleep duration and the risk of incident dementia according to the presence or absence of diseases among older Japanese individuals in the New Integrated Suburban Seniority Investigation (NISSIN) project.,"This study aimed to investigate the association between daily sleep duration and incident dementia among physically and socially independent older people with/without diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases) in a Japanese age-specific cohort.
We carried out a prospective cohort study including 1954 (1006 men and 948 women) Japanese individuals aged 64/65 years. Information on daily sleep duration, medical status, demographics, and lifestyle characteristics was collected by a baseline questionnaire survey and health checkup (2000-2005). Dates of incident dementia were confirmed using the nationally standardized dementia scale proposed by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. A competing risk model was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident dementia. We treated censored cases due to death as competing events.
During a median of 15.6 years of follow-up, 260 participants reported incident dementia. Compared with participants without diseases and who slept 6-7.9 h/day, those with a shorter daily sleep duration of <6 h/day, presence of disease and shorter, moderate, or longer daily sleep duration ≥8 h/day had an increased risk of incident dementia (HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.04-2.88, HR 1.98; 95% CI 1.14-3.44, HR 1.44; 95% CI 1.03-2.00, and HR 2.09; 95% CI 1.41-3.09, respectively) with a significant interaction between the presence of diseases and sleep duration (p < 0.001).
The present findings suggest that habitual sleep duration predicts future risk of dementia.","['Dementia', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Secondary prevention', 'Sleep duration']",Sleep medicine,2022-09-17,"[{'lastname': 'Ukawa', 'firstname': 'Shigekazu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Welfare Science and Clinical Psychology, Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology, Osaka, Japan.

30689589",Associations Between Vascular Diseases and Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementias in a Large Cohort of Men and Women with Colorectal Cancer.,"Long term risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) associated with vascular diseases in people with colorectal cancer is unknown.
To determine the risk of ADRD in association with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), stroke, hypertension, and diabetes in a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer.
This retrospective cohort study consisted of 210,809 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age≥65 years in 1991-2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database with follow-up from 1991-2016, who were free of any ADRD at the baseline (<12 months prior to or < 30 days after the date of cancer diagnosis).
The crude 26-year cumulative incidence of total ADRD in men and women with colorectal cancer was higher in those with versus without CVD (31.92% versus 28.12%), with versus without stroke (39.82% versus 26.39%), with versus without hypertension (31.88% versus 24.88%), and with versus without diabetes (32.01% versus 27.66%). After adjusting for socio-demographic and tumor factors, the risk of developing ADRD was significantly higher in patients with CVD (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.17, 95% confidence intervals: 1.14-1.20), stroke (1.65, 1.62-1.68), hypertension (1.07, 1.05-1.09), and diabetes (1.26, 1.24-1.29) versus persons without. For those with 1, 2, 3 and 4 vascular diseases present versus absent, the risk of AD increased from 1.12 (1.07-1.16) to 1.31 (1.25-1.36), 1.66 (1.57-1.75), and 2.03 (1.82-2.27).
In older patients with colorectal cancer, a significant dose-response relationship was observed between an increasing number of these vascular diseases and the risk of all types of dementia.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'colorectal cancer', 'dementias', 'medicare', 'vascular diseases']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-09-13,"[{'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Xianglin L', 'initials': 'XL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Lulu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.\nDepartment of Biostatistics and Data Science, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulz', 'firstname': 'Paul E', 'initials': 'PE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Hua', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Wenyaw', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}]",,"In older patients with colorectal cancer, a significant dose-response relationship was observed between an increasing number of these vascular diseases and the risk of all types of dementia.","The crude 26-year cumulative incidence of total ADRD in men and women with colorectal cancer was higher in those with versus without CVD (31.92% versus 28.12%), with versus without stroke (39.82% versus 26.39%), with versus without hypertension (31.88% versus 24.88%), and with versus without diabetes (32.01% versus 27.66%).

32633589",Factors Contributing to Sex Differences in Health-Related Quality of Life After Ischemic Stroke: BASIC (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi) Project.,"Background Women have been reported to have worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) following stroke than men, but uncertainty exists over the reasons for the sex difference. Methods and Results We included all ischemic strokes registered with the BASIC (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi) project (May 2010-December 2016), a population-based stroke study, who completed a 90-day outcome interview. Information on baseline characteristics was obtained from medical records and in-person interviews. HRQoL was measured by the 12-item short-form Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale. Multivariable Tobit regression was used to estimate the mean difference in overall HRQoL scores (range, 1-5; higher indicating better HRQoL) between sexes and to identify contributing factors to the differences. We included 1061 cases with complete data on HRQoL and covariates (median age, 67 years; 51% women). In unadjusted analyses, women had poorer overall HRQoL than men (mean difference, -0.26 [95% CI, -0.40 to -0.13]). Contributors to this difference included sociodemographic/prestroke factors (eg, age, race and ethnicity, prestroke function), risk factors/comorbidities (eg, history of stroke, Alzheimer disease/dementia), and initial stroke severity. Sociodemographic/prestroke factors explained 62% of the sex difference (mean difference, -0.08 [95% CI, -0.21 to 0.04]). In a fully adjusted model that included adjustment for all confounding factors, the sex difference was eliminated and became nonsignificant (mean difference, -0.03 [95% CI, -0.16 to 0.09]). Conclusions Poorer HRQoL in women compared with men was observed and explained by the combination of sociodemographic and prestroke factors, including physical function before stroke and stroke severity. The findings suggest potential subgroups of women who might benefit from more targeted interventions before and after stroke to improve HRQoL.","['ischemic stroke', 'quality and outcomes', 'quality of life', 'sex characteristics']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2022-09-04,"[{'lastname': 'Phan', 'firstname': 'Hoang T', 'initials': 'HT', 'affiliation': 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research University of Tasmania Hobart Australia.\nPublic Health Management Department Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam.'}, {'lastname': 'Reeves', 'firstname': 'Mathew J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Human Medicine Michigan State University East Lansing MI.'}, {'lastname': 'Gall', 'firstname': 'Seana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research University of Tasmania Hobart Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Morgenstern', 'firstname': 'Lewis B', 'initials': 'LB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yuliang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI.'}, {'lastname': 'Lisabeth', 'firstname': 'Lynda D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI.'}]",,,,,"10.1161/JAHA.122.026123

192,36055643,Informal care in Huntington's disease: Assessment of objective-subjective burden and its associated risk and protective factors.,"Because of the genetic transmission of Huntington's disease (HD), informal caregivers (ICs, i.e., non-professional caregivers) might experience consecutive and/or concurrent caregiving roles to support several symptomatic relatives with HD over their life. Additionally, some ICs might be HD carriers. However, whether family burden of care is associated with specific factors in HD remains poorly studied.
To provide a quantitative view of the IC burden and identify associated factors.
This was a cross-sectional assessment of home-dwelling symptomatic HD individuals (from REGISTRY and Bio-HD studies) and their primary adult ICs, including the HD individual's motor, cognitive, behavioral, functional Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale score; IC objective burden (quantification of IC time in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living and supervision, using the Resource Utilization in Dementia instrument), IC subjective burden (Zarit Burden Inventory), and ICs' social economic functioning and use of professional home care.
We included 80 ICs (mean [SD] age 57 [12.9] years, 60% women) in charge of 80 individuals with early to advanced stage HD (mean age 56 [12.6] years, 51% men). The mean hours of informal care time was high: 7.3 (7.9) h/day (range 0-24); the mean professional home care was 2.8 (2.8) h/day (range 0.1-12.3). This objective burden increased with higher functional loss of the HD individual and with more severe cognitive-behavioral disorders. The mean subjective burden (35.4 [17.8], range 4-73) showed a high level since the earliest stage of HD; it was associated with HD duration (mean 9.2 [4.7] years) and with aggressive symptoms in individuals (44% of cases). The burden was partially related to the multiplex caregiving status (19%). Protective factors lowering the IC burden included the absence of financial hardship (57%), a strong social network (16%) and keeping active on the job market outside home (46%).
The objective-subjective burden of ICs related to changing patterns of neuro-psychiatric symptoms and mitigating environmental characteristics around the HD individual-caregiver dyads.","['Bio-HD study', ""Huntington's Disease"", 'REGISTRY study', 'biomarkers', 'burden', 'family caregivers', 'informal care', 'multiplex']",Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine,2022-09-03,"[{'lastname': 'Bayen', 'firstname': 'Eléonore', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Service de Médecine Physique et de Réadaptation, hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, APHP, Paris, France et Faculté de Médecine, Sorbonne Université, Paris, France; Laboratoire d'Imagerie Biomédicale (LIB), Sorbonne Université, Paris, France; Global Brain Health Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, USA.

6880820",The effect of risk factors on cognition in adult cochlear implant candidates with severe to profound hearing loss.,"Hearing loss has been identified as a major modifiable risk factors for dementia. Adult candidates for cochlear implantation (CI) represent a population at risk of hearing loss-associated cognitive decline. This study investigated the effect of demographics, habits, and medical and psychological risk factors on cognition within such a cohort. Data from 34 consecutive adults with post-lingual deafness scheduled for CI were analyzed. Pure tone audiometry (PTA4) and Speech Discrimination Score (SDS) were recorded. The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for Hearing impaired individuals (RBANS-H) was used to measure cognition. Demographics (sex, age, years of education), habits (smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity), and medical factors (hypertension, diabetes, traumatic brain injury) were evaluated. Depression was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social inhibition with the Type D questionnaire (DS14). All participants (mean age 62 ± 15 years) suffered from severe to profound hearing loss (PTA4:129 ± 60 dB; SDS:14 ± 24%). The mean RBANS-H total score was 83 ± 16. Participants reported a mean of years of formal education of 12 ± 5 years. The prevalence of habits and medical risk factors was: physical inactivity (29%), body mass index >30 (28%), traumatic brain injury (25%), hypertension (24%), heavy alcohol consumption (13%), smoking (13%), and diabetes (0%). Regarding psychological factors, the mean scores of social inhibition and depression were 10 ± 6 and 6 ± 5, respectively. The number of years of education was significantly correlated with the RBANS-H total score (","['RBANS-H', 'age', 'cognition', 'education', 'habits', 'risk factors', 'severe to profound hearing loss']",Frontiers in psychology,2022-09-03,"[{'lastname': 'Calvino', 'firstname': 'Miryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, IdiPAZ Research Institute, Madrid, Spain.\nBiomedical Research Networking Centre on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sánchez-Cuadrado', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, IdiPAZ Research Institute, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gavilán', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, IdiPAZ Research Institute, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Lassaletta', 'firstname': 'Luis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, IdiPAZ Research Institute, Madrid, Spain.\nBiomedical Research Networking Centre on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Calvino, Sánchez-Cuadrado, Gavilán and Lassaletta.","10.3389/fpsyg.2022.837366

34099648",Assessment of Pretreatment and Posttreatment Evolution of Neurofilament Light Chain Levels in Patients Who Develop Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome.,"Determining whether neurofilament light chain (NfL) elevations in patients who develop immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) occur before or after infusion of cellular product is important to identify high-risk patients and inform whether neuroaxonal injury is latent or a consequence of treatment.
To quantify serial NfL levels in patients undergoing cellular therapy.
This retrospective 2-center study examined plasma NfL levels in 30 patients with detailed medical and treatment history, including all major pretreatment and posttreatment risk factors. Exclusion criteria included dementia and severe, symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
Patients' NfL levels were measured at 7 time points: baseline (prelymphodepletion), during lymphodepletion, postinfusion day (D) 1, D3, D7, D14, and D30. Prediction accuracy for the development of ICANS was next modeled using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) classification. Finally, univariate and multivariate modeling examined the association between NfL levels, ICANS, and potential risk factors including demographic (age, sex), oncologic (tumor burden, history of CNS involvement), neurologic (history of nononcologic CNS disease or neuropathy), and neurotoxic exposure histories (vincristine, cytarabine, methotrexate, or CNS radiotherapy).
A total of 30 patients (median [range] age, 64 [22-80] years; 12 women [40%] and 18 men [60%]) were included. Individuals who developed ICANS had elevations in NfL prior to lymphodepletion and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell infusion compared with those who did not develop ICANS (no ICANS: 29.4 pg/mL, vs any ICANS: 87.6 pg/mL; P < .001). Baseline NfL levels further predicted ICANS development with high accuracy (area under the ROC curve, 0.96), sensitivity (0.91), and specificity (0.95). Levels of NfL remained elevated across all time points, up to 30 days postinfusion. Baseline NfL levels correlated with ICANS severity but not demographic factors, oncologic history, nononcologic neurologic history, or history of exposure to neurotoxic therapies.
In a subset of patients in this cross-sectional study, the risk of developing ICANS was associated with preexisting neuroaxonal injury that was quantifiable with plasma NfL level. This latent neuroaxonal injury was present prior to drug administration but was not associated with historic neurotoxic therapies or nononcologic neurologic disease. Preinfusion NfL may further permit early screening and identification of patients most at risk for ICANS. Additional studies are needed to determine NfL's utility as a predictive biomarker for early (preemptive or prophylactic) intervention and to delineate the origin of this underlying neural injury.",[],JAMA oncology,2022-09-02,"[{'lastname': 'Butt', 'firstname': 'Omar H', 'initials': 'OH', 'affiliation': 'Siteman Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Alice Y', 'initials': 'AY', 'affiliation': 'Siteman Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Caimi', 'firstname': 'Paolo F', 'initials': 'PF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Ohio.'}, {'lastname': 'Luckett', 'firstname': 'Patrick H', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Wisch', 'firstname': 'Julie K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Derenoncourt', 'firstname': 'Paul-Robert', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Division of Nuclear Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Kenneth', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Gregory F', 'initials': 'GF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'de Lima', 'firstname': 'Marcos J G', 'initials': 'MJG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology, Ohio State University Cancer Treatment and Research Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus.'}, {'lastname': 'Campian', 'firstname': 'Jian L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Siteman Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Frank', 'firstname': 'Matthew J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California.'}, {'lastname': 'DiPersio', 'firstname': 'John F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Siteman Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghobadi', 'firstname': 'Armin', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Siteman Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}, {'lastname': 'Ances', 'firstname': 'Beau M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.'}]",,,"A total of 30 patients (median [range] age, 64 [22-80] years; 12 women [40%] and 18 men [60%]) were included.

We retrospectively reviewed data on post-discharge survival of 2586 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in our tertiary hospital from March 2020 to March 2021.
Among 2586 patients, 1446 (55.9%) were men. The median age was 70 years, interquartile range (IQR, 60-80). The median Charlson comorbidity index was 4 points, IQR (2-5). The median length of hospital stay was 10 days, IQR (7-16). During a median follow-up of 4 months, 192 (7.4%) patients died. The median survival time after hospital discharge was not reached, and 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month survival rates were 93%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, mutually independent predictors of worse mortality after hospital discharge were age >75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 4, white blood cell count >7 ×109/L, red cell distribution width >14%, urea on admission >10.5 mmol/L, mechanical ventilation during hospital stay, readmission after discharge, absence of obesity, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, and metastatic malignancy (P<0.05 for all).
Substantial risk of death persists after hospital admission due to COVID-19. Factors related to an increased risk are older age, higher functional impairment, need for mechanical ventilation during hospital admission, parameters indicating more pronounced inflammation, impaired renal function, and particular comorbidities.

196,35988591,Hip Fracture as a Predictive Marker for the Risk of Dementia: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"This study aimed to investigate the association between hip fracture and the risk of dementia.
A retrospective real-world propensity score-matched cohort study was conducted using the real-world hip fracture cohort (RHFC).
Electronic health record data from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) in Hong Kong were used. A total of 52,848 patients aged ≥65 years and with at least an event of fall from 2006 to 2015 were included in the RHFC.
The incidence of fall, hip fracture, and dementia was determined using their International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. Competing risk regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.
Hip fracture was associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15, P < .001). The subgroup analysis showed that association was significant in women but not in men.
Hip fracture was associated with the increased risk of dementia among older adults. Further studies investigating the potential roles of hip fracture in the development of dementia could benefit the management of both conditions in older adults.","['Epidemiology', 'dementia', 'hip fracture', 'osteoporosis']",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2022-08-22,"[{'lastname': 'Hsu', 'firstname': 'Warrington W Q', 'initials': 'WWQ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Xiaowen', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sing', 'firstname': 'Chor-Wing', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health Limited (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Gloria H Y', 'initials': 'GHY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Kathryn C B', 'initials': 'KCB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kung', 'firstname': 'Annie W C', 'initials': 'AWC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Janus S H', 'initials': 'JSH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Ian Chi-Kei', 'initials': 'IC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health Limited (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheung', 'firstname': 'Ching-Lung', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health Limited (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.

Participants who were diagnosed with MCI at baseline (
Cox proportional hazard regression controlling for age and education indicated that all variables significantly predicted subsequent progression to dementia for men and women. Sex interactions indicated that only Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) delayed recall and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) were significantly stronger risk factors for women. When all variables were entered into a fully adjusted model, significant risk factors for women were Aβ42, hippocampal volume, RAVLT delayed recall, Boston Naming Test, and FAQ. In contrast, for men, Aβ42, p-tau181, p-tau181/Aβ42, hippocampal volume, category fluency and FAQ were significant risk factors. Interactions with sex were only significant for p-tau181/Aβ42 and RAVLT delayed recall for the fully adjusted model.
Men and women with MCI may to differ for which factors predict subsequent dementia although future analyses with greater power are needed to evaluate sex differences.

34538105","Blood Pressure and Later-Life Cognition in Hispanic and White Adults (BP-COG): A Pooled Cohort Analysis of ARIC, CARDIA, CHS, FOS, MESA, and NOMAS.","Ethnic differences in cognitive decline have been reported. Whether they can be explained by differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) is uncertain.
Determine whether cumulative mean SBP levels explain differences in cognitive decline between Hispanic and White individuals.
Pooled cohort study of individual participant data from six cohorts (1971-2017). The present study reports results on SBP and cognition among Hispanic and White individuals. Outcomes were changes in global cognition (GC) (primary), executive function (EF) (secondary), and memory standardized as t-scores (mean [SD], 50 [10]); a 1-point difference represents a 0.1 SD difference in cognition. Median follow-up was 7.7 (Q1-Q3, 5.2-20.1) years.
We included 24,570 participants free of stroke and dementia: 2,475 Hispanic individuals (median age, cumulative mean SBP at first cognitive assessment, 67 years, 132.5 mmHg; 40.8% men) and 22,095 White individuals (60 years,134 mmHg; 47.3% men). Hispanic individuals had slower declines in GC, EF, and memory than White individuals when all six cohorts were examined. Two cohorts recruited Hispanic individuals by design. In a sensitivity analysis, Hispanic individuals in these cohorts had faster decline in GC, similar decline in EF, and slower decline in memory than White individuals. Higher time-varying cumulative mean SBP was associated with faster declines in GC, EF, and memory in all analyses. After adjusting for time-varying cumulative mean SBP, differences in cognitive slopes between Hispanic and White individuals did not change.
We found no evidence that cumulative mean SBP differences explained differences in cognitive decline between Hispanic and White individuals.","['Blood pressure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'cognition',

33561588","Osteoporosis and Related Health Status Among the Elderly Urban Residents in Elderly-Care Inns in Beijing, a Multicenter DXA Survey.","Identification of the high risk population for osteoporosis and timely prevention are the best strategies at present. Detailed epidemiological investigation in a well-defined population is necessary to explore the population-based characteristics and risk factors of osteoporosis, thus to facilitate better prevention programs.
In this prospective cross-sectional study, 1423 questionnaires were given out to the urban residents (female ≥ 40 years of age, male ≥50 years) who lived in the 27 Elderly-Care Inns interspersed among the seven central urban areas of Beijing. All participants were voluntary and underwent routine physical examination and spine and hip BMD measurements using the DXA instrument. The study protocols were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (JDZX2015079).
Altogether 1407 participants fulfilled the survey. Among 359 men, the prevalence of osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal BMD were 18.1%, 56.6%, and 25.3%, respectively; among 1048 women, the corresponding figures were 40.3%, 42.8%, and 16.9%, respectively. After adjustment of age and BMI, both hands grip strength, height loss over 3 cm, serum levels of β-CTx, PINP, and OST were the independent risk factors for osteoporosis in both men and women; besides, familial Alzheimer's disease history in men; and history of steatohepatitis and fracture, serum levels of PTH and ALT, age of menarche, age of menopause, and duration of menstruation in women were also risk factors of osteoporosis. In both genders, the cost-effective method, which adopted both hands grip strength, height loss over 3 cm, and medical history, indicated a good predictive ability to evaluate the risk of osteoporosis (in men AUC=0.730, 95%CI=0.642~0.817; in women AUC=0.769, 95%CI=0.724~0.813).
In the population of elderly Beijing urban residents in Elderly-Care Inns, the prevalence of osteoporosis in women is higher than that in men and increases with aging more rapidly; the prevalence of osteopenia in men is higher than in women. The cost-effective method, including both hands grip strength, height loss over 3 cm, and familial Alzheimer's disease history in men; fracture and steatohepatitis history as well as menstrual history in women is recommended in identifying the high-risk subjects for osteoporosis.","['DXA', 'osteopenia', 'osteoporosis', 'risk factor', 'survey', 'urban area in Beijing']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-08-13,"[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'XinChao', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'HongTao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lian', 'firstname': 'YiGang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kou', 'firstname': 'Jiajing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'GuangLei', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'YiYun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Xu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Miao', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'QiaoHui', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}]","In this prospective cross-sectional study, 1423 questionnaires were given out to the urban residents (female ≥ 40 years of age, male ≥50 years) who lived in the 27 Elderly-Care Inns interspersed among the seven central urban areas of Beijing.

33534870",Incidence and Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Older Adults Living with Dementia: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"The identification of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality in patients with dementia is a key aspect to support clinical decisions and public health interventions.
To assess the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related death in a cohort of patients with dementia residing in the Lazio region and to investigate predicting factors for both infection and mortality.
This population-based study used information from administrative databases and the SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance system. Patients with dementia (age ≥65) were enrolled as of December 31, 2019 and followed-up until February 28, 2021. Cumulative risk of infection and death within 60 days of infection onset, and age-standardized incidence (SIR) and mortality (SMR) ratios were calculated. Logistic regression models were applied to identify factors associated with infection and mortality.
Among 37,729 dementia patients, 2,548 had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The crude risk of infection was 6.7%. An increase in risk of infection was observed both in women (SIR 1.72; 95% CI 1.64-1.80) and men (SIR 1.43; 95% CI 1.33-1.54). Pneumonia, cerebrovascular and blood diseases, femur fracture, anxiety, antipsychotic and antithrombotic use were associated with an increased risk of infection. The crude risk of death was 31.0%, the SMRs 2.32 (95% CI 2.05-2.65) for men, and 2.82 (95% CI 2.55-3.11) for women. Factors associated with mortality included: male gender, age ≥85, symptoms at the diagnosis, antipsychotic and systemic antibiotics treatment.
These findings emphasize the need of close and tailored monitoring of dementia patients to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on this fragile population.","['Administrative databases', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'cohort study', 'dementia', 'prognostic factors']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-08-02,"[{'lastname': 'Cascini', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Agabiti', 'firstname': 'Nera', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Marino', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Acampora', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Balducci', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Calandrini', 'firstname': 'Enrico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Davoli', 'firstname': 'Marina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bargagli', 'firstname': 'Anna Maria', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy.'}]",,These findings emphasize the need of close and tailored monitoring of dementia patients to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on this fragile population.,"Among 37,729 dementia patients, 2,548 had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

30324412",Telomere Length and Risk of Incident Fracture and Arthroplasty: Findings From UK Biobank.,"We investigated independent associations between telomere length and risk of fracture and arthroplasty in UK Biobank participants. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was measured in baseline samples using a validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We used, in men and women separately, Cox proportional hazards models to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for incident fracture (any, osteoporotic) or arthroplasty (hip or knee) over 1,186,410 person-years of follow-up. Covariates included age, white cell count, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, and menopause (women). In further analyses we adjusted for either estimated bone mineral density (eBMD) from heel quantitative ultrasound, handgrip strength, gait speed, total fat mass (bioimpedance), or blood biomarkers, all measured at baseline (2006-2010). We studied 59,500 women and 51,895 men, mean ± standard deviation (SD) age 56.4 ± 8.0 and 57.0 ± 8.3 years, respectively. During follow-up there were 5619 fractures; 5285 hip and 4261 knee arthroplasties. In confounder-adjusted models, longer LTL was associated with reduced risk of incident knee arthroplasty in both men (HR/SD 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.97) and women (0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96), and hip arthroplasty in men (0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.95), but not women (0.98; 95% CI, 0.94-1.01). Longer LTL was weakly associated with reduced risk of any incident fracture in women (HR/SD 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00) with less evidence in men (0.98; 95% CI, 0.93-1.02). Associations with incident outcomes were not materially altered by adjustment for heel eBMD, grip strength, gait speed, fat mass, or blood biomarker measures. In this, the largest study to date, longer LTL was associated with lower risk of incident knee or hip arthroplasty, but only weakly associated with lower risk of fracture. The relative risks were low at a population level, but our findings suggest that common factors acting on the myeloid and musculoskeletal systems might influence later life musculoskeletal outcomes. © 2022 The Authors.

28815009",Risk factors for dementia in the context of cardiovascular disease: A protocol of an overview of reviews.,"Dementia is a major public health priority. Although there is abundant evidence of an association between dementia and poor cardiovascular health, findings have been inconsistent and uncertain in identifying which factors increase dementia risk in those with cardiovascular disease. Indeed, multiple variables including sociodemographic, economic, health, lifestyle and education may indicate who is at higher vs. lower dementia risk and could be used in prediction modelling. Therefore, the aim of this review is to synthesise evidence on the key risk factors for dementia in those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
This is an overview of reviews protocol, registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021265363). Four electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched. Studies will be included if they are systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses that have investigated the risk of incident dementia (all-cause and subtypes including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) in people with a history of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and vascular stiffness. Study selection will be completed by two independent researchers according to the eligibility criteria, and conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. References will be exported into Covidence for title and abstract sifting, full-text review, and data extraction. Methodological quality will be assessed using the AMSTAR-2 criteria and confidence of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE classification. This overview of reviews will follow PRISMA guidelines. If there is sufficient homogeneity in the data, the results will be pooled, and a meta-analysis conducted to determine the strength of association between each risk factor and incident all-cause dementia and its subtypes for each cardiovascular diagnoses separately.
We will create a comprehensive summary of the key risk factors linking cardiovascular diseases to risk of incident dementia. This knowledge is essential for informing risk predictive model development as well as the development of risk reduction and prevention strategies.",[],PloS one,2022-07-22,"[{'lastname': 'Brain', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Mental Health, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Innovation Park, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham, United Kingdom.\nFreemasons Foundation Centre for Men's Health, Discipline of Medicine, School of Psychology, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Tully', 'firstname': 'Phillip J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, School of Psychology, University of New England, Armidale, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Turnbull', 'firstname': 'Deborah', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Freemasons Foundation Centre for Men's Health, Discipline of Medicine, School of Psychology, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Eugene', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences Institute, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Greene', 'firstname': 'Leanne', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Clinical Trials Unit, College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, United Kingdom.""}, {'lastname': 'Beach', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""University of Nottingham Libraries, University of Nottingham, King's Meadow Campus, Nottingham, United Kingdom.""}, {'lastname': 'Siervo', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Mental Health, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Innovation Park, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Stephan', 'firstname': 'Blossom C M', 'initials': 'BCM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Mental Health, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Innovation Park, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham, United Kingdom.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0271611

23653312",Gender and Social Isolation across the Life Course.,"Social isolation has robust adverse effects on health, well-being, dementia risk, and longevity. Although most studies suggest similar effects of isolation on the health of men and women, there has been much less attention to gendered patterns of social isolation over the life course-despite decades of research suggesting gender differences in social ties. We build on theoretical frames of constrained choice and gender-as-relational to argue that gender differences in isolation are apparent but depend on timing in the life course and marital/partnership history. Results indicate that boys/men are more isolated than girls/women through most of the life course, and this gender difference is much greater for the never married and those with disrupted relationship histories. Strikingly, levels of social isolation steadily increase from adolescence through later life for both men and women.","['aging', 'gender', 'life course', 'relationships', 'social isolation']",Journal of health and social behavior,2022-07-21,"[{'lastname': 'Umberson', 'firstname': 'Debra', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Zhiyong', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cha', 'firstname': 'Hyungmin', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.1177/00221465221109634

206,35811519,Organized Registration for the Assessment of Dementia by the Nationwide General Consortium Toward Effective Treatment (ORANGE) Registry: Current Status and Perspectives of Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"With increasingly aging societies, a comprehensive strategy for dementia research is important. The Organized Registration for the Assessment of dementia by the Nationwide General consortium toward Effective treatment (ORANGE) Registry is the first longitudinal multicenter prospective trial-ready cohort in Japan.
To establish a large cohort for use in clinical trials and research in Japan.
This registry, based on communities, hospitals, and nursing homes, covers three dementia stages (preclinical, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and advanced dementia), and includes more than 30 hospitals. We analyzed enrollment and 1-year follow-up data for disease progression.
There were 1450 registered patients (649 men, 801 women; mean age, 77.92±6.70 years; mean Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, 25.19±2.76). The conversion rates from MCI to dementia and MCI to normal were 14.3% and 1.1%, respectively. High Clinical Dementia Rating score (odds ratio [OR] = 11.085, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.619-75.913, p = 0.014), low MMSE score (OR = 0.835, 95% CI: 0.761-0.917, p < 0.001), high Geriatric Depression Scale score (OR = 1.093, 95% CI: 1.005-1.189, p = 0.038), and low body mass index (OR = 0.895, 95% CI: 0.829-0.967, p = 0.005) at enrollment were significant factors for conversion.
The ORANGE MCI Registry is an established registry that facilitates creation of trial-ready cohorts to accelerate promotion of clinical trials with low reversion rates as it originates from a hospital. One-year follow-up analysis suggested assessing various factors for conversion risk. Further analyses will be possible in future with registry expansion. We will continue to refine this registry, including how it can be used more efficiently.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'cognitive dysfunction', 'dementia', 'humans', 'longitudinal studies', 'preventive medicine', 'registries']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-07-12,"[{'lastname': 'Tsujimoto', 'firstname': 'Masashi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Innovation Center for Translational Research, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Keisuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Innovation Center for Translational Research, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saji', 'firstname': 'Naoki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Innovation Center for Translational Research, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sakurai', 'firstname': 'Takashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Innovation Center for Translational Research, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ito', 'firstname': 'Kengo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Innovation Center for Translational Research, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.\nCentre for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Toba', 'firstname': 'Kenji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,"The ORANGE MCI Registry is an established registry that facilitates creation of trial-ready cohorts to accelerate promotion of clinical trials with low reversion rates as it originates from a hospital.

11356998",Soy product intake and risk of incident disabling dementia: the JPHC Disabling Dementia Study.,"We evaluated the association between total soy, soy product (natto, miso and tofu) and isoflavone intake and incident disabling dementia in a Japanese population.
We conducted a population-based prospective study in 18,991 men and 22,456 women. Intake of soy products and isoflavone was calculated using a validated food frequency questionnaire when participants were 45-74 years old (1995 and 1998). Incident disabling dementia was defined by the daily living disability status related to dementia in the long-term care insurance program of Japan from 2006 to 2016. Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of disabling dementia were calculated by quintiles of total soy, individual soy product and isoflavone intake, using Cox proportional hazard regression models.
Total soy product intake was not associated with disabling dementia risk in both men and women. By individual soy products, natto intake was marginally inversely associated with disabling dementia in women (trend P = 0.050). When we stratified by age, this inverse association was clearer in women aged under 60 years (multivariate HR for the highest versus lowest quintile was 0.78, 95% CI 0.59-1.04, trend P = 0.020 for those aged under 60 years and 0.90, 95% CI 0.77-1.05, trend P = 0.23 for those aged 60 years and older, respectively). Any soy product or isoflavone intake was not associated with disabling dementia risk in men.
Although total soy product intake was not associated with disabling dementia risk, natto intake may contribute to reducing the risk of disabling dementia in women, especially in those aged under 60 years.","['Cohort study', 'Disabling dementia', 'Fermented soy', 'Japan', 'Soy products']",European journal of nutrition,2022-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Murai', 'firstname': 'Utako', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cohort Research, National Cancer Center Institute for Cancer Control, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.\nDepartment of Public Health Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, and Health Services Research and Development Center, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sawada', 'firstname': 'Norie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cohort Research, National Cancer Center Institute for Cancer Control, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan. nsawada@ncc.go.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Charvat', 'firstname': 'Hadrien', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of International Health Policy Research, National Cancer Center Institute for Cancer Control, Tokyo, Japan.\nFaculty of International Liberal Arts, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Inoue', 'firstname': 'Manami', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cohort Research, National Cancer Center Institute for Cancer Control, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.\nDivision of Prevention, National Cancer Center Institute for Cancer Control, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yasuda', 'firstname': 'Nobufumi', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Kochi University Medical School, Kochi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamagishi', 'firstname': 'Kazumasa', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, and Health Services Research and Development Center, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsugane', 'firstname': 'Shoichiro', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cohort Research, National Cancer Center Institute for Cancer Control, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.\nNational Institute of Health and Nutrition, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,"Total soy product intake was not associated with disabling dementia risk in both men and women.

208,35786756,Functional improvement after inpatient rehabilitation in community hospitals following acute hospital care.,"There are limited studies exploring functional improvement in relation to characteristics of patients who, following acute hospital care, receive inpatient rehabilitation in community hospitals. We evaluated the association of acute hospital admission-related factors with functional improvement on community hospital discharge.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients who were transferred to community hospitals within 14-day post-discharge from acute hospital between 2016 and 2018. Modified Barthel Index (MBI) on a 100-point ordinal scale was used to assess functional status on admission to and discharge from the community hospital. We categorised MBI into 6 bands: 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-90, 91-99 and 100. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to determine factors associated with categorical improvement in functional status, defined as an increase in at least one MBI band between admission and discharge.
A total of 5,641 patients (median age 77 years, interquartile range 69-84; 44.2% men) were included for analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders, factors associated with functional improvement were younger age, a higher MBI on admission, and musculoskeletal diagnosis for the acute hospital admission episode. In contrast, a history of dementia or stroke; lower estimated glomerular filtration rate; abnormal serum albumin or anaemia measured during the acute hospital episode; and diagnoses of stroke, cardiac disease, malignancy, falls or pneumonia; and other chronic respiratory diseases were associated with lower odds of functional improvement.

209,35781021,Alcohol use disorder: Neuroimaging evidence for accelerated aging of brain morphology and hypothesized contribution to age-related dementia.,"Excessive alcohol use curtails longevity by rendering intoxicated individuals vulnerable to heightened risk from accidents, violence, and alcohol poisoning, and makes chronically heavy drinkers vulnerable to acceleration of age-related medical and psychiatric conditions that can be life threatening (Yoon, Chen, Slater, Jung, & White, 2020). Thus, studies of factors influencing age-alcohol interactions must consider the potential that the alcohol use disorder (AUD) population may not represent the oldest ages of the unaffected population and may well have accrued comorbidities associated with both AUD and aging itself. Herein, we focus on the aging of the brains of men and women with AUD, keeping AUD contextual factors in mind. Knowledge of the potential influence of the AUD-associated co-factors on the condition of brain structure may lead to identifying modifiable risk factors to avert physical declines and may reverse or arrest further AUD-related degradation of the brain. In this narrative review, we 1) describe quantitative, controlled studies of brain macrostructure and microstructure of adults with AUD, 2) consider the possibility of recovery of brain integrity through harm reduction with sustained abstinence or reduced drinking, and 3) speculate on the ramifications of accelerated aging in AUD as contributing to age-related dementia.","['DTI', 'MRI', 'age', 'alcohol use disorder', 'brain', 'neuropsychology']","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2022-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Sullivan', 'firstname': 'Edith V', 'initials': 'EV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.

30320425",New Onset (Incidence) of Epilepsy and Seizures in Nursing Home Residents.,"The point prevalence of epilepsy is high in nursing homes (NH), but the incidence of epilepsy after admission is unknown. This study was done to determine the incidence of epilepsy/seizure (epi/sz) comorbid with other conditions in older adult NH residents.
Retrospective evaluation of Minimum Data Set records to identify new onset epi/sz in NH residents.
Five cross-sectional cohorts of all residents in any Medicare/Medicaid certified NH in the United States on July 15 of each year 2003-2007.
Epi/sz was identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (345.xx or 780.39) or check box on the Minimum Data Set. Those with no such code on admission and with 1 to 3 plus years of follow-up (n = 3,609,422) were followed through 2007 or end of stay.
Overall incidence of epi/sz was 16.42/1000 patient years (PY). Incidence was highest in the first year after admission and declined thereafter. There were more women (n = 2,523,951) than men (n = 1,089,631), but men had a higher incidence (21.17/1000PY) compared with women (14.81/1000PY). Although the 65‒74 years of age cohort included fewer residents (n = 594,722) compared with the age 85 years + cohort (n = 1,520,167), the younger residents had the highest incidence (28.53/1000 PY) compared with the oldest, 10.22/1000 PY for the age 85+ years cohort. The highest incidences were among those with brain tumor (122.55/1000PY), followed by head injury (45.66/1000PY). Overall, 714,340 had a diagnosis of stroke, and incidence was 27.52/1000PY. Those with none of selected risk factors had an overall incidence of 12.45/1000PY.
The incidence of epi/sz in older individuals after admission to a NH is high. There is a need to develop practice approaches to best manage this large cohort. There does not appear to be a uniform approach to managing new onset epilepsy in NHs at this time. Studies to develop evidence for practice guidelines are needed.","['Incidence', 'brain trauma', 'dementia', 'epilepsy/seizures', 'stroke']",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2022-07-03,"[{'lastname': 'Leppik', 'firstname': 'Ilo E', 'initials': 'IE', 'affiliation': 'Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

29968816",Associations of Bilateral Vestibulopathy With Cognition in Older Adults Matched With Healthy Controls for Hearing Status.,"Recent literature suggests there may be a significant effect of the vestibular system on cognition and visuospatial processing. Given the increasing prevalence of dementia and individuals at risk for it, exploring possible modifiable risk factors, including vestibular dysfunction, is vital.
To explore the association of bilateral vestibulopathy (BV) with cognitive function in older adults, taking hearing status into account, and to explore multiple vestibular characteristics and their potential associations with cognition in patients with BV.
This cross-sectional study assessed older adults (age 55-84 years) with diagnosed BV from a single center using baseline measurements from the Gehoor, Evenwicht en Cognitie (GECKO) study, an ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study. Each participant was individually matched with a healthy control based on age, sex, and hearing performance. Data were analyzed in January 2022.
The primary outcome measure was cognition, measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for Hearing-Impaired Individuals (RBANS-H).
A total of 68 patients were assessed, including 34 patients with BV (mean [SD] age, 63.3 [6.0] years; 18 [53%] men) matched with 34 control individuals without BV. Overall, participants with BV had a clinically meaningful lower score on the RBANS-H total scale compared with those without BV (mean [SD] score, 98.62 [12.70] vs 105.91 [11.03]). This decline was most pronounced in the subdomains of immediate memory (mean [SD] score, 107.74 [10.66] vs 112.26 [10.66]), visuospatial cognition (mean [SD] score, 90.06 [13.34] vs 100.47 [13.91]), and attention (mean [SD] score, 94.79 [16.39] vs 102.06 [12.97]). There were no differences in language or delayed memory subdomains. Within the BV population, 1 vestibular parameter (the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, in particular the balance subscale) was associated with lower cognitive scores (r32 = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.72; η2 = 0.26). Other vestibular parameters, including measurements of the peripheral vestibular end organ and questionnaires, showed no association.
These findings suggest there was an association between vestibular loss and cognitive impairment. Further research on the causal mechanisms underlying this association and the possible impact of vestibular rehabilitation on cognition is needed.",[],JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,2022-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Bosmans', 'firstname': 'Joyce', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Gommeren', 'firstname': 'Hanne', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nUniversity Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Mertens', 'firstname': 'Griet', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nUniversity Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Cras', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nDepartment of Neurology, Antwerp University Hospital and Institute Born-Bunge, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Engelborghs', 'firstname': 'Sebastiaan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel and Center for Neurosciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Ombergen', 'firstname': 'Angelique', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Vereeck', 'firstname': 'Luc', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy, Move Antwerp, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilles', 'firstname': 'Annick', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nUniversity Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.\nDepartment of Education, Health & Social Work, University College Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Rompaey', 'firstname': 'Vincent', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nUniversity Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.'}]",,,"A total of 68 patients were assessed, including 34 patients with BV (mean [SD] age, 63.3 [6.0] years; 18 [53%] men) matched with 34 control individuals without BV.

32527275",Heterogeneous adverse childhood experiences and cognitive function in an elderly Chinese population: a cohort study.,"To identify the heterogeneity of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as well as their association with cognitive function in an elderly Chinese population.
A retrospective cohort study.
The data were from the latest wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study and a total of 7222 participants aged ≥60 were included.
Latent class analysis was used to identify the classes characterised by 11 types of ACEs. Cognitive function was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and cognitive impairment was defined by education-specific threshold MMSE scores. Logistic models were constructed to examine the relationship between ACE classes and cognitive impairment. Several childhood and adulthood confounding factors were considered.
Three ACE latent classes were identified. Of them, 76.09% were in the 'Low ACEs' class, 15.43% were in the 'Household dysfunction' class and 8.49% were in the 'Child maltreatment' class. The people in the 'Low ACEs' class seemed to have better childhood family financial situations and higher education levels. The population in the 'Household dysfunction' class tended to live in rural areas and have a higher proportion of men, whereas people in the 'Child maltreatment' class showed a significantly higher proportion of women and higher levels of chronic diseases. 'Child maltreatment' was related to a higher risk of cognitive impairment (OR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.68), while the risk of 'Household dysfunction' was not significantly different from that of the 'Low ACEs' participants (OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.26).
The findings supported differences in cognitive function in elderly Chinese people exposed to different types of ACEs.","['dementia', 'geriatric medicine', 'public health']",BMJ open,2022-06-11,"[{'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Manqiong', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.\nSchool of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Fengzhi', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Chuanhai', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Ya', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China fangya@xmu.edu.cn.\nSchool of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.'}]",,,"Three ACE latent classes were identified.

21463662",Alcohol-Drinking Under Limited-Access Procedures During Mature Adulthood Accelerates the Onset of Cognitive Impairment in Mice.,"A history of heavy drinking increases vulnerability to, and the severity of, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, with alcohol use disorder identified as the strongest modifiable risk factor for early-onset dementia. Heavy drinking has increased markedly in women over the past 10 years, particularly in mature adult women during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This is concerning as women are more sensitive to many alcohol-related disease states, including AD and related dementias. Herein, we conducted two studies to determine if a 1-month period of binge drinking during mature adulthood (i.e., 5-9 months of age) impairs spatial and working memory to a greater extent in female vs. male C57BL/6J (B6J) mice. The anxiogenic and cognitive-impairing effects of binge drinking were also compared between mature adult and old B6J mice (18 months of age) in a third study. Throughout, females consumed more alcohol than males, indicating that a sex difference in binge drinking persists into old age. Despite the sex difference in intake, we detected no consistent sex difference in our measures of alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety during a behavioral test battery. Although mature adult females exhibited more cognitive deficits than males, the precise outcome exhibiting a female-selective effect varied across studies. Old mice drank lower amounts of alcohol than mature adult mice, yet their blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) were within error of the 80 mg/dl criterion for binge drinking, indicative of an age-related slowing of alcohol metabolism. As expected, 18-month-old controls exhibited more signs of cognitive impairment than their 6-month-old counterparts, and binge drinking history impaired the Morris water maze performance of mice of both ages. In contrast, binge drinking history impaired the radial arm maze performance of 6-month-old mice only, and the extent of the impairment was comparable to the behavior exhibited by the older mice. We conclude from our studies that: (1) both biological sex and the age of drinking onset are subject factors that impact voluntary alcohol consumption by mice into old age; (2) binge drinking during later life elicits a negative affective state that is relatively sex-independent; (3) binge drinking during both mature adulthood and old age impairs spatial learning and memory; (4) binge drinking during mature adulthood accelerates deficits in working memory; and (5) mature adult females tend to exhibit more alcohol-induced cognitive impairments than males. If relevant to humans, these findings suggest that binge-like drinking by older adult men and women induces a negative affective state and cognitive decline, but that mature adult women, in particular, may be more sensitive to both the immediate and persistent cognitive-impairing effects of heavy drinking.","['aging', 'binge-drinking', 'dementia', 'sex differences', 'spatial memory', 'working memory']",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2022-06-11,"[{'lastname': 'Jimenez Chavez', 'firstname': 'C Leonardo', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Doren', 'firstname': 'Eliyana', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Matalon', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ogele', 'firstname': 'Nneoma', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kharwa', 'firstname': 'Aadithya', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Madory', 'firstname': 'Lauren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kazerani', 'firstname': 'Ida', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Herbert', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Torres-Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Jose', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Rivera', 'firstname': 'Emely', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Szumlinski', 'firstname': 'Karen K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.\nDepartment of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology and the Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Jimenez Chavez, Van Doren, Matalon, Ogele, Kharwa, Madory, Kazerani, Herbert, Torres-Gonzalez, Rivera and Szumlinski.","10.3389/fnbeh.2022.732375

215,35662122,Sex-Differential Associations Between Body Mass Index and the Incidence of Dementia.,"Little is known about the sex differences in the association between body mass index (BMI) and dementia in late life.
Therefore, this retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze associations between BMI and dementia in older women and men separately in general practices in Germany.
This study included patients followed in one of 832 general practices in Germany between 2006 and 2019 (index date: first visit date). Study variables included dementia (dependent variable), BMI (independent variable), age, sex, and comorbidities (control variables). Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted Cox regression analyses were conducted to analyze associations between BMI and the 10-year incidence of dementia in women and men, separately.
There were 296,767 patients included in this study (mean [standard deviation] age 70.2 [5.9] years; 54.3% women). The proportion of underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity was 0.9%, 25.5%, 41.5%, and 32.1%, respectively. The 10-year incidence of dementia significantly decreased with increasing BMI, from 11.5% in women with underweight to 9.1% in those with obesity (log-rank p < 0.001). Respective figures in men were 12.0% and 8.2% (log-rank p < 0.001). In women, only overweight (versus normal weight) was significantly associated with dementia (HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.88-0.97). In contrast, in men, the only BMI category significantly associated with the incidence of dementia was underweight (HR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.11-2.25).
In this study conducted in Germany, overweight was negatively associated with dementia in women, whereas there was a positive underweight-dementia relationship in men. More data are needed to confirm or refute these findings in other settings.","['Body mass index', 'Germany', 'dementia', 'retrospective cohort study', 'sex differences']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Jacob', 'firstname': 'Louis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERSAM, ISCIII, Dr. Antoni Pujadas, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.\nFaculty of Medicine, University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Lee', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health, Performance and Wellbeing, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Koyanagi', 'firstname': 'Ai', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERSAM, ISCIII, Dr. Antoni Pujadas, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.\nInstitució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), Pg.

Respective figures in men were 12.0% and 8.2% (log-rank p < 0.001). In women, only overweight (versus normal weight) was significantly associated with dementia (HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.88-0.97). In contrast, in men, the only BMI category significantly associated with the incidence of dementia was underweight (HR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.11-2.25).",,10.3233/JAD-220147,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd4533b0>,,,,,,

22379246",Neurovascular disease in Switzerland: 10-year trends show non-traditional risk factors on the rise and higher exposure in women.,"Effective risk factor modification is the prerequisite to prevent neurovascular disease such as stroke or vascular dementia. Non-traditional vascular risk factors (nt-vrfs) including stress significantly add to the risk of neurovascular disease arising from traditional vascular risk factors (t-vrfs). In order to discover sex-specific changes that may underlie previously reported inclines in the prevalence of neurovascular and cardiovascular disease in women, 10-year trends in the prevalence of vrfs in Switzerland were assessed.
Anonymized data from 22,134 participants (51% women) of the governmental Swiss Health Survey, performed every 5 years (2007, 2012 and 2017), were obtained. Epidemiological parameters, t-vrfs and nt-vrfs were analyzed in a cross-sectional study design.
Over the observation period, the number of women having full-time jobs increased considerably (2007 38%, 2012 39%, 2017 44%). This was accompanied by a substantial rise in the prevalence of nt-vrfs in women and men including stress at work (2007, not available; 2012 women/men 58%/60%; 2017 women/men 66%/65%), low locus of control (women/men: 2007 21%/19%, 2012 22%/19%, 2017 25%/22%) and sleep disorders (women/men: 2007 30%/22%, 2012 28%/20%, 2017 32%/26%). Amongst t-vrfs, only the prevalence of obesity and hypercholesterolemia increased over time in both sexes, whilst other t-vrfs remained stable (hypertension [27%], diabetes [5%]) or decreased (smoking [9.4 cigarettes/day]).
A rise in women's economic participation alongside a higher affection with nt-vrfs in the female Swiss population emphasizes the need to improve vascular risk stratification and implement effective preventive measures for neurovascular and cardiovascular disease.","['Switzerland', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cardiovascular risk factors', 'prevalence', 'sex', 'stroke']",European journal of neurology,2022-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Hänsel', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience Center, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Steigmiller', 'firstname': 'Klaus', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics at Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Luft', 'firstname': 'Andreas R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience Center, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gebhard', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Held', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics at Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wegener', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience Center, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}]",,,"Over the observation period, the number of women having full-time jobs increased considerably (2007 38%, 2012 39%, 2017 44%).

217,35640780,Gender-specific impact of cognitive impairment on all-cause mortality in older persons: A meta-analysis.,"Gender-specific impact of cognitive impairment on survival in the general population remains controversial. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the gender difference in the impact of cognitive impairment on all-cause mortality in the general population.
Two reviewers independently searched PubMed and Embase databases up to September 30, 2021 for cohort studies that reported gender-specific impact of cognitive impairment detected by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) on all-cause mortality in elderly general population (aged ≥60 years) in the same study.
Nine articles reporting on 10 studies with a total of 52,134 individuals were included. The pooled multivariate-adjusted risk ratio (RR) of all-cause mortality associated with cognitive impairment compared with those without was 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-1.61) in women and 1.34 (95% CI 1.24-1.44) in men, after adjusting for potential confounding. The pooled multivariate-adjusted female-to-male ratio of relative risk of all-cause mortality was 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) for individuals with cognitive impairment versus those without.
Cognitive impairment detected by the MMSE is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in older aged women than in men from the general population, even after adjusting sociodemographic factors. Compared with men with cognitive impairment, women with cognitive impairment had an 8% higher risk of all-cause mortality. These findings highlight the importance of early detection and management of cognitive impairment in older adults, particularly in women.","['All-cause mortality', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Gender difference', 'Meta-analysis', 'Mini-mental state examination']",Experimental gerontology,2022-06-01,"[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Shukai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurosurgery, Sanya Central Hospital (Hainan Third People's Hospital), Sanya 572000, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Minglei', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Sanya Central Hospital (Hainan Third People's Hospital), Sanya 572000, China.

19015485","Insulin-Like Growth Factor, Inflammation, and MRI Markers of Alzheimer's Disease in Predominantly Middle-Aged Adults.","Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and further evidence suggests inflammation can be a moderator of this association. However, most research to date has been conducted on older adults.
To investigate the association of serum IGF-1 and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) concentrations with MRI markers of Alzheimer's disease in predominantly middle-aged adults, and further assess moderation by chronic inflammation.
We included participants from the Framingham Heart Study (n = 1,852, mean age 46±8, 46% men) and the Study of Health in Pomerania (n = 674, mean age 50±13, 42% men) with available serum IGF-1, IFGBP-3, as well as brain MRI. IGF-1 and IFGBP-3 were related to MRI outcomes (i.e., total brain, cortical gray matter, white matter, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and hippocampal volumes) using multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses by C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were also performed. Cohort-specific summary statistics were meta-analyzed using random-effects models and corrected for multiple comparisons.
Meta-analysis results revealed that higher IGF-1 concentrations were associated with lower WMH (estimate [β] [95% CI], -0.05 [-0.09, -0.02], p = 0.006) and larger hippocampal volumes (0.07 [0.02, 0.12], p = 0.01), independent of vascular risk factors. These associations occurred predominantly in individuals with CRP concentrations < 75th percentile. We did not observe associations between IGFBP-3 and MRI outcomes.
Our findings suggest that IGF-1-related signaling may be implicated in brain health as early as midlife.","['Alzheimer’s disease endophenotype', 'C-reactive protein', 'cohort study', 'epidemiology', 'hippocampus', 'insulin-like growth factor', 'neuroimaging', 'white matter hyperintensity\n']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-05-24,"[{'lastname': 'Wittfeld', 'firstname': 'Katharina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Site Rostock/Greifswald, Germany.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Raman', 'firstname': 'Mekala R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.\nFramingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Conner', 'firstname': 'Sarah C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aslam', 'firstname': 'Asra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Long School of Medicine, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Teumer', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Community Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nDZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nDepartment of Population Medicine and Lifestyle Diseases Prevention, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Nauck', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nInstitute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hosten', 'firstname': 'Norbert', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Diagnostic Radiology and Neuroradiology, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Habes', 'firstname': 'Mohamad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's & Neurodegenerative Diseases, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.\nDepartment of Radiology, Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, Penn Memory Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'DeCarli', 'firstname': 'Charles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vasan', 'firstname': 'Ramachandran S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Framingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Beiser', 'firstname': 'Alexa S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.\nFramingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA, USA.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Himali', 'firstname': 'Jayandra J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.\nFramingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA, USA.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.\nGlenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's & Neurodegenerative Diseases, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Seshadri', 'firstname': 'Sudha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.\nFramingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA, USA.\nGlenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's & Neurodegenerative Diseases, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Grabe', 'firstname': 'Hans J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Site Rostock/Greifswald, Germany.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Satizabal', 'firstname': 'Claudia L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.\nFramingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA, USA.\nGlenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's & Neurodegenerative Diseases, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.""}]",,Our findings suggest that IGF-1-related signaling may be implicated in brain health as early as midlife.,"Meta-analysis results revealed that higher IGF-1 concentrations were associated with lower WMH (estimate [β] [95% CI], -0.05 [-0.09, -0.02], p = 0.006) and larger hippocampal volumes (0.07 [0.02, 0.12], p = 0.01), independent of vascular risk factors.

27327500",Lifestyle Affects Amyloid Burden and Cognition Differently in Men and Women.,"Evidence on associations of lifestyle factors with Alzheimer's pathology and cognition are ambiguous, potentially because they rarely addressed inter-relationships of factors and sex effects. While considering these aspects, we examined the relationships of lifestyle factors with brain amyloid burden and cognition.
We studied 178 cognitively normal individuals (women, 49%; 65.0 [7.6] years) and 54 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (women, 35%; 71.3 [8.3] years) enrolled in a prospective study of volunteers who completed 
Overall, higher cognitive activity was associated with better cognitive performance and higher physical activity was associated with lower amyloid burden. The latter association was weakened to a nonsignificant level after excluding multivariate outliers. Examination of the moderating effect of sex in the model revealed an inverse association of metabolic/vascular risk with cognition in men, whereas in women metabolic/vascular risk trended toward increased amyloid burden. Furthermore, a significant inverse association between physical activity and amyloid burden was found only in men. Inheritance of an APOE4 allele was associated with higher amyloid burden only in women.
Sex modifies effects of certain lifestyle-related factors on amyloid burden and cognition. Notably, our results suggest that the negative impact of metabolic/vascular risk influences the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease through distinct paths in women and men.

31796920",Differential Effects of APOE Genotype on MicroRNA Cargo of Cerebrospinal Fluid Extracellular Vesicles in Females With Alzheimer's Disease Compared to Males.,"Multiple biological factors, including age, sex, and genetics, influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Of the 6.2 million Americans living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2021, 3.8 million are women and 2.4 million are men. The strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is apolipoprotein E-e4 (APOE-e4). Female APOE-e4 carriers develop AD more frequently than age-matched males and have more brain atrophy and memory loss. Consequently, biomarkers that are sensitive to biological risk factors may improve AD diagnostics and may provide insight into underlying mechanistic changes that could drive disease progression. Here, we have assessed the effects of sex and APOE-e4 on the miRNA cargo of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) extracellular vesicles (EVs) in AD. We used ultrafiltration (UF) combined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to enrich CSF EVs (e.g., Flotillin+). CSF EVs were isolated from female and male AD or controls (CTLs) that were either APOE-e3,4 or -e3,3 positive (n = 7/group, 56 total). MiRNA expression levels were quantified using a custom TaqMan™ array that assayed 190 miRNAs previously found in CSF, including 25 miRNAs that we previously validated as candidate AD biomarkers. We identified changes in the EV miRNA cargo that were affected by both AD and sex. In total, four miRNAs (miR-16-5p, -331-3p, -409-3p, and -454-3p) were significantly increased in AD vs. CTL, independent of sex and APOE-e4 status. Pathway analysis of the predicted gene targets of these four miRNAs with identified pathways was highly relevant to neurodegeneration (e.g., senescence and autophagy). There were also three miRNAs (miR-146b-5p, -150-5p, and -342-3p) that were significantly increased in females vs. males, independent of disease state and APOE-e4 status. We then performed a statistical analysis to assess the effect of APOE genotype in AD within each sex and found that APOE-e4 status affects different subsets of CSF EV miRNAs in females vs. males. Together, this study demonstrates the complexity of the biological factors associated with AD risk and the impact on EV miRNAs, which may contribute to AD pathophysiology.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'apolipoprotein E allele (APOE)', 'cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)', 'extracellular vesicle (EV)', 'microRNA', 'sex difference']",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2022-05-17,"[{'lastname': 'Sandau', 'firstname': 'Ursula S', 'initials': 'US', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'McFarland', 'firstname': 'Trevor J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Sierra J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Galasko', 'firstname': 'Douglas R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Quinn', 'firstname': 'Joseph F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States.\nParkinson Center and Movement Disorders Program, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States.\nPortland VAMC Parkinson's Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Portland, OR, United States.""}, {'lastname': 'Saugstad', 'firstname': 'Julie A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Sandau, McFarland, Smith, Galasko, Quinn and Saugstad.","10.3389/fcell.2022.864022

32390636",High-fat diet exacerbates cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia in a sex-dependent manner.,"Approximately 70% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have co-morbid vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID); this highly prevalent overlap of dementia subtypes is known as mixed dementia (MxD). AD is more prevalent in women, while VCID is slightly more prevalent in men. Sex differences in risk factors may contribute to sex differences in dementia subtypes. Unlike metabolically healthy women, diabetic women are more likely to develop VCID than diabetic men. Prediabetes is 3× more prevalent than diabetes and is linked to earlier onset of dementia in women, but not men. How prediabetes influences underlying pathology and cognitive outcomes across different dementia subtypes is unknown. To fill this gap in knowledge, we investigated the impact of diet-induced prediabetes and biological sex on cognitive function and neuropathology in mouse models of AD and MxD.
Male and female 3xTg-AD mice received a sham (AD model) or unilateral common carotid artery occlusion surgery to induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (MxD model). Mice were fed a control or high fat (HF; 60% fat) diet from 3 to 7 months of age. In both sexes, HF diet elicited a prediabetic phenotype (impaired glucose tolerance) and weight gain.
In females, but not males, metabolic consequences of a HF diet were more severe in AD or MxD mice compared to WT. In both sexes, HF-fed AD or MxD mice displayed deficits in spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM). In females, but not males, HF-fed AD and MxD mice also displayed impaired spatial learning in the MWM. In females, but not males, AD or MxD caused deficits in activities of daily living, regardless of diet. Astrogliosis was more severe in AD and MxD females compared to males. Further, AD/MxD females had more amyloid beta plaques and hippocampal levels of insoluble amyloid beta 40 and 42 than AD/MxD males. In females, but not males, more severe glucose intolerance (prediabetes) was correlated with increased hippocampal microgliosis.
High-fat diet had a wider array of metabolic, cognitive, and neuropathological consequences in AD and MxD females compared to males. These findings shed light on potential underlying mechanisms by which prediabetes may lead to earlier dementia onset in women.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Cerebral hypoperfusion', 'Dementia', 'Diabetes', 'Glucose intolerance', 'High-fat diet', 'Inflammation', 'Metabolic', 'Obesity', 'Sex', 'Vascular']",Journal of neuroinflammation,2022-05-16,"[{'lastname': 'Gannon', 'firstname': 'Olivia J', 'initials': 'OJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Robison', 'firstname': 'Lisa S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.\nDepartment of Psychology & Neuroscience, Nova Southeastern University, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314, USA.\nDepartment of Psychology, Stetson University, 421 N Woodland Blvd, DeLand, FL, 32723, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Salinero', 'firstname': 'Abigail E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abi-Ghanem', 'firstname': 'Charly', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mansour', 'firstname': 'Febronia M', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelly', 'firstname': 'Richard D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tyagi', 'firstname': 'Alvira', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brawley', 'firstname': 'Rebekah R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Stetson University, 421 N Woodland Blvd, DeLand, FL, 32723, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ogg', 'firstname': 'Jordan D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Stetson University, 421 N Woodland Blvd, DeLand, FL, 32723, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zuloaga', 'firstname': 'Kristen L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue; MC-136, Albany, NY, 12208, USA. zuloagk@amc.edu.'}]",,,"In females, but not males, metabolic consequences of a HF diet were more severe in AD or MxD mice compared to WT.

27989290",Risk Factors Associated With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias by Sex and Race and Ethnicity in the US.,"Previous estimates suggested that 1 in 3 cases of Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRDs) in the US are associated with modifiable risk factors, the most prominent being physical inactivity, depression, and smoking. However, these estimates do not account for changes in risk factor prevalence over the past decade and do not consider potential differences by sex or race and ethnicity.
To update estimates of the proportion of ADRDs in the US that are associated with modifiable risk factors and to assess for differences by sex and race and ethnicity.
For this cross-sectional study, risk factor prevalence and communality were obtained from the nationally representative US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data from January 2018 to December 2018, and relative risks for each risk factor were extracted from meta-analyses. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to August 2021. Respondents included 378 615 noninstitutionalized adults older than 18 years. The number before exclusion was 402 410. Approximately 23 795 (~6%) had missing values on at least 1 of the variables of interest.
Physical inactivity, current smoking, depression, low education, diabetes, midlife obesity, midlife hypertension, and hearing loss.
Individual and combined population-attributable risks (PARs) associated with ADRDs, accounting for nonindependence between risk factors.
Among 378 615 individuals, 171 161 (weighted 48.7%) were male, and 134 693 (weighted 21.1%) were 65 years and older. Race and ethnicity data were self-reported and defined by the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Data; 6671 participants (weighted 0.9%) were American Indian and Alaska Native, 8043 (weighted 5.1%) were Asian, 29 956 (weighted 11.7%) were Black, 28 042 (weighted 16.0%) were Hispanic (any race), and 294 394 (weighted 64.3%) were White. Approximately 1 in 3 of ADRD cases (36.9%) in the US were associated with 8 modifiable risk factors, the most prominent of which were midlife obesity (17.7%; 95% CI, 17.5-18.0), physical inactivity (11.8%; 95% CI, 11.7-11.9), and low educational attainment (11.7%; 95% CI, 11.5-12.0). Combined PARs were higher in men (35.9%) than women (30.1%) and differed by race and ethnicity: American Indian and Alaska Native individuals, 39%; Asian individuals, 16%; Black individuals, 40%; Hispanic individuals (any race), 34%; and White individuals, 29%. The most prominent modifiable risk factors regardless of sex were midlife obesity for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals, Black individuals, and White individuals; low education for Hispanic individuals; and physical inactivity for Asian individuals.
The findings suggest that risk factors associated with ADRDs have changed over the past decade and differ based on sex and race and ethnicity. Alzheimer risk reduction strategies may be more effective if they target higher-risk groups and consider current risk factor profiles.",[],JAMA neurology,2022-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Nianogo', 'firstname': 'Roch A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles.\nCalifornia Center for Population Research, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosenwohl-Mack', 'firstname': 'Amy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Yaffe', 'firstname': 'Kristine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Carrasco', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoffmann', 'firstname': 'Coles M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Deborah E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, California.'}]",,,"Among 378 615 individuals, 171 161 (weighted 48.7%) were male, and 134 693 (weighted 21.1%) were 65 years and older.

23243115",Sex Differences in Memory: Do Female Reproductive Factors Explain the Differences?,"The sex differences in memory impairment were inconclusive, and the effect of female reproductive factors (age at menarche, age at menopause, and reproductive period) on the differences was not clear. We aimed to examine the sex differences in objective and subjective memory impairment in postmenopausal women and age- and education-matched men and explore whether the differences were differed by female reproductive factors.
Data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Using the case-control matching method, 3,218 paired postmenopausal women and men matched for age and education were selected. Memory was assessed using the three-word recall task and a self-rated question. Poisson regression models with a robust error variance were used.
The relative risk was 1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.38) for objective memory impairment in women compared with men (23.87% vs. 27.36%), and 1.51 (1.36-1.67) for subjective memory impairment (39.34% vs. 28.25%) after adjusting the confounders. The higher risk of objective memory impairment in women was different among groups of age at menarche in a linear pattern, with younger age at menarche associated with higher risks of objective memory impairment (
Postmenopausal women were at an increased risk of objective and subjective memory impairment than men. The higher risks in objective memory, but not subjective memory, were varied by age at menarche, age at menopause, and reproductive periods, which may help understand the underlying mechanisms of sex differences in cognitive ageing and guide precise intervention to preventing dementia among older women and men.","['cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment', 'estrogen', 'menarche', 'menopause']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Jie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research (Shandong University), Jinan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hao', 'firstname': 'Wenting', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research (Shandong University), Jinan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Chunying', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research (Shandong University), Jinan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Chengchao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research (Shandong University), Jinan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Dongshan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research (Shandong University), Jinan, China.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.'}]",,,"The relative risk was 1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.38) for objective memory impairment in women compared with men (23.87% vs. 27.36%), and 1.51 (1.36-1.67) for subjective memory impairment (39.34% vs. 28.25%) after adjusting the confounders.

16971698",Better cognitive function in younger generations - Insights from two cohort studies of middle-aged to older adults in Wisconsin.,"Understanding generational trends in dementia and cognitive decline is essential to quantify future healthcare needs and may help identify interventions and preventions. We aimed to determine whether individuals from more recent generations showed better neurocognitive function.
This cross-sectional study combined data from 4439 participants (mean age 64 years (SD = 13); 57% were women) from the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study and Beaver Dam Offspring Study. We assessed participants' birth cohort (1901-1924, Greatest Generation; 1925-1945, Silent Generation; 1946-1964, Baby Boom Generation; 1965-1984, Generation X) and neurocognition (Trail-Making Tests A and B, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Verbal Fluency Test). Multivariable linear regression models were utilized.
Adjusted for age, sex, education, and known risk factors for cognitive decline, more recent generations showed better processing speed, executive function, attention, and verbal fluency than the Greatest Generation. Largest benefits were found in the Baby Boom Generation. Compared with the Greatest Generation, individuals from the Baby Boom Generation performed better on Trail-Making Tests A (-0.21 ln(time in s); 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.29, -0.13) and B (-0.31 ln(time in s); 95% CI -0.40, -0.22), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (6.07 numbers correct; 95% CI 3.61, 8.52) and Verbal Fluency Test (8.75 numbers correct; 95% CI 5.07, 12.42 in women; 5.28 numbers correct; 95% CI 0.79, 9.78 in men), with effect sizes similar to effects of 11-15 years of less aging.
This indicates that some benefits of younger generations might be related to yet unknown and potentially modifiable environmental, health-related or lifestyle factors and motivates research of such underlying factors to promote healthy cognitive aging.","['Aging', 'Birth cohort', 'Cognition', 'Executive function', 'Memory', 'Processing speed']",Maturitas,2022-05-09,"[{'lastname': 'Merten', 'firstname': 'Natascha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Department of Population Health Sciences, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI, USA; Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI, USA; Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI, USA.

9471928",Subclinical carotid artery atherosclerosis and cognitive function in older adults.,"The combined effects of increased life expectancy and the considerable number of persons reaching old age will magnify the dementia epidemic in the USA. Demonstration that subclinical atherosclerosis precedes and is associated with cognitive impairment suggests a modifiable risk factor for age-associated cognitive impairment and dementia. The purpose of this study is to determine whether subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is associated with changes in cognitive function over time in older adults.
This study combined longitudinal data from three clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2013: the B-Vitamin Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (BVAIT), the Women's Isoflavone Soy Health (WISH) trial, and the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE). Participants were recruited from the general population in the Greater Los Angeles area and were free of cardiovascular disease and diabetes; no cognitive or psychiatric exclusion criteria were specified. The same standardized protocol for ultrasound image acquisition and measurement of CIMT was used in all trials. CIMT measurements performed at baseline and 2.5 years were used in these analyses. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and 2.5 years using a battery of 14 standardized cognitive tests. All clinical trials were conducted at the University of Southern California Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Los Angeles, and had at least 2.5 years of cognitive follow-up.
A total of 308 men and 1187 women, mean age of 61 years, were included in the combined longitudinal dataset for the primary analysis. No associations were found between CIMT and cognitive function at baseline or at 2.5 years. There was a weak inverse association between CIMT measured at baseline and change in global cognition assessed over 2.5 years (β (SE) = - 0.056 (0.028) units per 0.1 mm CIMT, 95% CI - 0.110, - 0.001, p = 0.046). No associations between CIMT at baseline and changes in executive function, verbal memory, or visual memory were found.
In this sample of healthy older adults, our findings suggest an association between subclinical atherosclerosis and change in global cognitive function over 2.5 years. Stronger associations were observed longitudinally over 2.5 years than cross-sectionally. When analysis was stratified by age group (<65 and ≥65 years old), the inverse association remained statistically significant for participants in the older age group. Subclinical atherosclerosis of the carotid artery may be a modifiable correlate of cognitive decline in middle and older age.

16522654","Sex differences in the association between cardiovascular diseases and dementia subtypes: a prospective analysis of 464,616 UK Biobank participants.","Whether the association of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) with dementia differs by sex remains unclear, and the role of socioeconomic, lifestyle, genetic, and medical factors in their association is unknown.
We used data from the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort study of 502,649 individuals. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and women-to-men ratio of HRs (RHR) for the association between CVD (coronary heart diseases (CHD), stroke, and heart failure) and incident dementia (all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD)). The moderator roles of socioeconomic (education, income), lifestyle (smoking, BMI, leisure activities, and physical activity), genetic factors (APOE allele status), and medical history were also analyzed.
Compared to people who did not experience a CVD event, the HRs (95%CI) between CVD and all-cause dementia were higher in women compared to men, with an RHR (Female/Male) of 1.20 (1.13, 1.28). Specifically, the HRs for AD were higher in women with CHD and heart failure compared to men, with an RHR (95%CI) of 1.63 (1.39, 1.91) and 1.32 (1.07, 1.62) respectively. The HRs for VD were higher in men with heart failure than women, with RHR (95%CI) of 0.73 (0.57, 0.93). An interaction effect was observed between socioeconomic, lifestyle, genetic factors, and medical history in the sex-specific association between CVD and dementia.
Women with CVD were 1.5 times more likely to experience AD than men, while had 15% lower risk of having VD than men.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Cohort study', 'Coronary heart diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Sex difference', 'Stroke', 'Vascular dementia']",Biology of sex differences,2022-05-08,"[{'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Caiyun', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\nNHC Key Lab of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Chunmiao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\nNHC Key Lab of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Chunying', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\nNHC Key Lab of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hao', 'firstname': 'Wenting', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\nNHC Key Lab of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ozaki', 'firstname': 'Akihiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Breast Surgery, Jyoban Hospital of Tokiwa Foundation, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan.\nDepartment of Gastrointestinal Tract Surgery, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shrestha', 'firstname': 'Nipun', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Care and Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Virani', 'firstname': 'Salim S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Michael E.

30740140",Educating the masses to address a global public health priority: The Preventing Dementia Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).,"Dementia is a global public health priority and risk reduction is an important pillar of the public health response. While 40% of cases are estimated to be attributable to modifiable health and lifestyle risk factors, public awareness of the evidence is low, limiting peoples' opportunity to adopt risk-reducing behaviours. To address this gap, we designed, implemented, and evaluated an educational intervention, the Preventing Dementia Massive Open Online Course (PDMOOC). This mixed-methods study examined the reach and impact of the free and globally available PDMOOC, to assess its potential to provide effective dementia risk reduction education to a broad international audience. Over 100,000 individuals participated in the PDMOOC across seven iterations from 2016 to 2020, with 55,739 of these consenting to participate in research. Their mean age was 49 years (SD = 15), they came from 167 different countries, and the majority were female (86%), had completed post-secondary education (77%), lived in high-income countries (93%) and worked in health care and social assistance (63%). This demographic profile changed across time, with more men, people with higher education and people from low- and middle-income countries participating in recent course iterations. Two-thirds of participants completed the PDMOOC; completion was associated with being aged 50 to 70 years, residing in a high-income country, having tertiary education, and working in the health sector. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the PDMOOC, improved dementia risk reduction understanding and self-efficacy, increased motivation to maintain healthy lifestyles, and, importantly, application of their learning to health behaviour change with the potential to reduce their dementia risk. The PDMOOC educated a large global audience about dementia risk reduction, which contributed to participants making risk-reducing behaviour changes. This suggests MOOCs can be a successful public health strategy to improve dementia risk reduction understanding.",[],PloS one,2022-05-05,"[{'lastname': 'Farrow', 'firstname': 'Maree', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fair', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klekociuk', 'firstname': 'Shannon Z', 'initials': 'SZ', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Vickers', 'firstname': 'James C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0267205

32276604",Modifying effects of race and ethnicity and APOE on the association of physical activity with risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.,"We investigated whether the protective association of physical activity with risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) has genetic or behavioral variations.
In the Multiethnic Cohort, we analyzed moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA) reported at ages 45 to 75 among 88,047 participants in relation to 13,039 incident diagnoses of late-onset ADRD identified in Medicare claims (1999 to 2014), by five racial and ethnic groups, hours sitting, and in a subset (16%), apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.
MVPA was inversely associated with ADRD (hazard ratio for ≥14 vs <2.5 hours/week: 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76 to 0.90 in men; 0.88, 5% CI: 0.81 to 0.95 in women). The association was inverse in all racial and ethnic groups except Black participants (P-heterogeneity = 0.52), but stronger in individuals with lower levels of sitting duration or those who do not carry the APOE e4 risk allele.
The different effects of physical activity by sitting duration and APOE genotype warrant further research.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'dementia', 'physical activity', 'prospective studies', 'race and ethnicity', 'sitting']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2022-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Song-Yi', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Setiawan', 'firstname': 'Veronica Wendy', 'initials': 'VW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine and Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'White', 'firstname': 'Lon R', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': 'Pacific Health Research and Education Institute, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, John A.

31589352",Association of Traumatic Brain Injury With and Without Loss of Consciousness With Neuropathologic Outcomes in Community-Dwelling Older Persons.,"A history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been considered a risk factor for Alzheimer dementia. However, the specific association of TBI, even without loss of consciousness (LOC), with pathologic findings that underlie Alzheimer dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD), non-AD neurodegenerative, and vascular pathologic findings, remains unclear.
To examine the association between TBI with and without LOC and neuropathologic findings in community-based cohorts.
This cross-sectional analysis used neuropathologic data from 1689 participants from the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Minority Aging Research Study. These studies began enrollment in 1994, 1997, and 2004, respectively. The current study's data set was frozen on April 3, 2021, when the mean (SD) length of follow-up for the participants was 8.7 (5.5) years.
Traumatic brain injury exposure was assessed using a standardized, self-reported questionnaire at baseline and annual follow-up visits. Participants were categorized into those (1) without TBI exposure (n = 1024), (2) with TBI with LOC (n = 161), or (3) with TBI without LOC (n = 504).
Neuropathologic measures of amyloid-β, paired helical filament tangles, neocortical Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, hippocampal sclerosis, gross infarcts, and microinfarcts were assessed. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression models were used to determine whether TBI with or without LOC (compared with no TBI exposure as the reference group) was associated with neuropathologic outcomes after adjusting for age at death, sex, and educational level. Whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and sex differences modified associations was also examined.
A total of 1689 participants (1138 [67%] women and 551 [33%] men; mean [SD] age at death, 89.2 [6.7] years; 80 [5%] Black, 46 [3%] Latino, 1639 [97%] non-Latino, and 1601 [95%] White) participated in the study. Compared with participants without TBI, participants with TBI with LOC had a greater amyloid-β load (estimate, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06-0.43; P = .008) and higher odds of having 1 or more gross infarcts (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.04-2.02; P = .02) and 1 or more microinfarcts (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.38; P = .002), particularly subcortical microinfarcts (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.23-2.79; P = .002). Those with TBI without LOC had higher odds of neocortical Lewy bodies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.87; P = .04) and 1 or more cortical microinfarcts (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87; P = .008). The association of TBI with and without LOC with vascular pathologic outcomes persisted after controlling for vascular risk factors and vascular disease burden. Traumatic brain injury with or without LOC was not associated with paired helical filament tangles, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, or hippocampal sclerosis. No interactions occurred with APOE ε4 or sex.
This cross-sectional analysis suggests that a history of TBI, even without LOC, is associated with age-related neuropathologic outcomes, both neurodegenerative and vascular. The variation in the neuropathologic outcomes in individuals with and without LOC may provide clues to potential mechanisms, diagnoses, and management in persons with TBI.",[],JAMA network open,2022-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Agrawal', 'firstname': 'Sonal', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Pathology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'Leurgans', 'firstname': 'Sue E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'James', 'firstname': 'Bryan D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Lisa L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Behavioral Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Rupal I', 'initials': 'RI', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Pathology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': ""Dams-O'Connor"", 'firstname': 'Kristen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Mt Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Neurology, Mt Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Mez', 'firstname': 'Jesse', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.""}, {'lastname': 'Bennett', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'Schneider', 'firstname': 'Julie A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Pathology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}]",,,"A total of 1689 participants (1138 [67%] women and 551 [33%] men; mean [SD] age at death, 89.2 [6.7] years; 80 [5%] Black, 46 [3%] Latino, 1639 [97%] non-Latino, and 1601 [95%] White) participated in the study.

17052857",Sex Differences in Cognition Across Aging.,"Sex and gender differences are seen in cognitive disturbances in a variety of neurological and psychiatry diseases. Men are more likely to have cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia whereas women are more likely to have more severe cognitive symptoms with major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is important to understand sex and gender differences in underlying cognitive abilities with and without disease. Sex differences are noted in performance across various cognitive domains - with males typically outperforming females in spatial tasks and females typically outperforming males in verbal tasks. Furthermore, there are striking sex differences in brain networks that are activated during cognitive tasks and in learning strategies. Although rarely studied, there are also sex differences in the trajectory of cognitive aging. It is important to pay attention to these sex differences as they inform researchers of potential differences in resilience to age-related cognitive decline and underlying mechanisms for both healthy and pathological cognitive aging, depending on sex. We review literature on the progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, as an example of pathological cognitive aging in which human females show greater lifetime risk, neuropathology, and cognitive impairment, compared to human males. Not surprisingly, the relationships between sex and cognition, cognitive aging, and Alzheimer's disease are nuanced and multifaceted. As such, this chapter will end with a discussion of lifestyle factors, like education and diet, as modifiable factors that can alter cognitive aging by sex. Understanding how cognition changes across age and contributing factors, like sex differences, will be essential to improving care for older adults.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Diabetes', 'Diet', 'Females', 'Hippocampus', 'Males', 'Obesity']",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2022-04-26,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Bonnie H', 'initials': 'BH', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nDjavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Richard', 'firstname': 'Jennifer E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'de Leon', 'firstname': 'Romina Garcia', 'initials': 'RG', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nDjavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Yagi', 'firstname': 'Shunya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nDjavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Galea', 'firstname': 'Liisa A M', 'initials': 'LAM', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. liisa.galea@ubc.ca.\nDjavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. liisa.galea@ubc.ca.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. liisa.galea@ubc.ca.'}]",,,,"© 2022.

32123385",Plasma Amyloid and in vivo Brain Amyloid in Late Middle-Aged Hispanics.,"Determining amyloid positivity is possible with cerebrospinal fluid and brain imaging of amyloid, but these methods are invasive and expensive.
To relate plasma amyloid-β (Aβ), measured using Single-molecule array (Simoatrademark) assays, to in vivo brain Aβ, measured using positron emission tomography (PET), examine the accuracy of plasma Aβ to predict brain Aβ positivity, and the relation of APOE ɛ4 with plasma Aβ.
We performed a cross-sectional analysis in a cohort of 345 late middle-aged Hispanic men and women (age 64 years, 72% women). Our primary plasma variable was Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio measured with Simoa. Brain Aβ burden was measured as global SUVR with 18F-Florbetaben PET examined continuously and categorically.
Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was inversely associated with global Aβ SUVR (β= -0.13, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.23, -0.03; p = 0.013) and Aβ positivity (Odds Ratio: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.91; p = 0.016), independent of demographics and APOE ɛ4. ROC curves (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.82; p < 0.0001) showed that the optimal threshold for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in relation to brain Aβ positivity was 0.060 with a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 62.8%. APOE ɛ4 carriers had lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and a higher Aβ positivity determined with the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio threshold of 0.060.
Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio assayed using Simoa is weakly correlated with in vivo brain amyloid and has limited accuracy in screening for amyloid positivity and for studying risk factors of brain amyloid burden when in vivo imaging is not feasible.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'amyloid', 'brain', 'hispanics', 'middle age', 'plasma', 'positron emission tomography']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-04-26,"[{'lastname': 'Rippon', 'firstname': 'Brady', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Palta', 'firstname': 'Priya', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), New York, NY, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Joseph P.

20363244",Blueberry Supplementation in Midlife for Dementia Risk Reduction.,"Late-life dementia typically develops over a period of many years beginning in midlife. Prevalence of metabolic disturbance also accelerates in middle age and is a prominent risk factor for dementia. Preliminary studies indicate that blueberry supplementation can improve cognitive performance and influence metabolism and brain function and therefore may have a role in early intervention to prevent neurodegeneration. In a randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of daily blueberry supplementation in a middle-aged sample of insulin-resistant participants with elevated risk for future dementia. We enrolled overweight men and women, aged 50 to 65 years, with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and performed pre- and post-intervention assessments of cognition and metabolism and exploratory measures of peripheral mitochondrial function. We observed improved performances for the blueberry group on measures of lexical access, ","['BMI', 'cognition', 'insulin resistance']",Nutrients,2022-04-24,"[{'lastname': 'Krikorian', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Skelton', 'firstname': 'Matthew R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': ""Division of Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Summer', 'firstname': 'Suzanne S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': ""Bionutrition Core, Clinical Translational Research Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Shidler', 'firstname': 'Marcelle D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sullivan', 'firstname': 'Patrick G', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Spinal Cord & Brain Injury Research Center, Chandler College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/nu14081619

21069833",Gender gap in deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.,"Previous studies have shown less access to deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) in women compared to men raising concerns about a potential gender gap resulting from nonclinical factors or gender differences in clinical efficacy for postoperative quality of life (QoL), motor, and nonmotor symptoms (NMS) outcomes. This was a cross-sectional and a longitudinal, prospective, observational, controlled, quasi-experimental, international multicenter study. A total sample size of 505 consisted of 316 consecutively referred patients for DBS indication evaluation at the University Hospital Cologne (01/2015-09/2020) and 189 consecutively treated patients at DBS centers in the University Hospitals Cologne and Marburg, Salford's Royal Hospital Manchester, and King's College Hospital London. In the cross-sectional cohort, we examined gender proportions at referral, indication evaluations, and DBS surgery. In the longitudinal cohort, clinical assessments at preoperative baseline and 6-month follow-up after surgery included the PD Questionnaire-8, NMSScale, Scales for Outcomes in PD-motor scale, and levodopa-equivalent daily dose. Propensity score matching resulted in a pseudo-randomized sub-cohort balancing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between women with PD and male controls. 316 patients were referred for DBS. 219 indication evaluations were positive (women n = 102, respectively n = 82). Women with PD were disproportionally underrepresented in referrals compared to the general PD population (relative risk [RR], 0.72; 95%CI, 0.56-0.91; P = 0.002), but more likely to be approved for DBS than men (RR, 1.17; 95%CI, 1.03-1.34; P = 0.029). Nonetheless, their total relative risk of undergoing DBS treatment was 0.74 (95%CI, 0.48-1.12) compared to men with PD. At baseline, women had longer disease duration and worse dyskinesia. Exploring QoL domains, women reported worse mobility and bodily discomfort. At follow-up, all main outcomes improved equally in both genders. Our study provides evidence of a gender gap in DBS for PD. Women and men with PD have distinct preoperative nonmotor and motor profiles. We advocate that more focus should be directed toward the implementation of gender equity as both genders benefit from DBS with equal clinical efficacy. This study provides Class II evidence of beneficial effects of DBS in women with PD compared to male controls.",[],NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022-04-22,"[{'lastname': 'Jost', 'firstname': 'Stefanie T', 'initials': 'ST', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany. stefanie.jost@uk-koeln.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Strobel', 'firstname': 'Lena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rizos', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Parkinson Foundation International Centre of Excellence, King's College Hospital, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Loehrer', 'firstname': 'Philipp A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Marburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ashkan', 'firstname': 'Keyoumars', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Parkinson Foundation International Centre of Excellence, King's College Hospital, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'Julian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Greater Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosenkranz', 'firstname': 'Franz', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbe', 'firstname': 'Michael T', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Fink', 'firstname': 'Gereon R', 'initials': 'GR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.\nCognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Research Centre Jülich, Jülich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Franklin', 'firstname': 'Jeremy', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Statistics and Computational Biology (IMSB), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sauerbier', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nimsky', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sattari', 'firstname': 'Afsar', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Cologne, Faculty of Humanities, Cologne, Germany.\nGerman Association of Women Engineers, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ray Chaudhuri', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Parkinson Foundation International Centre of Excellence, King's College Hospital, London, UK.\nInstitute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.\nNIHR Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre and Dementia Biomedical Research Unit, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Antonini', 'firstname': 'Angelo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Parkinson and Movement Disorders Unit, Department of Neurosciences (DNS), University of Padua, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Timmermann', 'firstname': 'Lars', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Marburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Martinez-Martin', 'firstname': 'Pablo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Center for Networked Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Institute of Health, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Silverdale', 'firstname': 'Monty', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Greater Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalbe', 'firstname': 'Elke', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Psychology, Neuropsychology and Gender Studies & Center for Neuropsychological Diagnostics and Interventions (CeNDI), Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Visser-Vandewalle', 'firstname': 'Veerle', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dafsari', 'firstname': 'Haidar S', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany. haidar.dafsari@uk-koeln.de.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,© 2022.

34372587",Clinical features predicting COVID-19 mortality risk.,"Currently, the world is involved by a pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), which has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people so far. The consequences of infection with SARS-CoV-2 vary widely from asymptomatic to severe. Considering the increasing prevalence of different types of virus and acute infection with this disease, strategies to prevent mortality from COVID-19 should be seriously analyzed. In this study, the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were investigated in order to identify risk factors for mortality. Chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), COPD, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, increased D-dimer, male gender, old age, smoking and obesity are among the deadly risk factors associated COVID-19. Furthermore, lymphopenia and neutrophilia are often present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and the ratio of absolute neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) was significantly increased in patients without bacterial infection. These findings could be used in the future to control and prevent disease, because timely identification of patients with risk of COVID-19 is important to provide better treatment strategies for reduction of mortality.",[],European journal of translational myology,2022-04-16,"[{'lastname': 'Kouhpayeh', 'firstname': 'Hamidreza', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tropical and Infectious Diseases Department, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran; Zahedan University of Medical Sciences Research Center, Emam Ali Hospital, Zahedan. hkouhpayeh@yahoo.com.'}]",,,,,"10.4081/ejtm.2022.10268

28736759",Prediction of disability-free survival in healthy older people.,"Prolonging survival in good health is a fundamental societal goal. However, the leading determinants of disability-free survival in healthy older people have not been well established. Data from ASPREE, a bi-national placebo-controlled trial of aspirin with 4.7 years median follow-up, was analysed. At enrolment, participants were healthy and without prior cardiovascular events, dementia or persistent physical disability. Disability-free survival outcome was defined as absence of dementia, persistent disability or death. Selection of potential predictors from amongst 25 biomedical, psychosocial and lifestyle variables including recognized geriatric risk factors, utilizing a machine-learning approach. Separate models were developed for men and women. The selected predictors were evaluated in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and validated internally by bootstrapping. We included 19,114 Australian and US participants aged ≥65 years (median 74 years, IQR 71.6-77.7). Common predictors of a worse prognosis in both sexes included higher age, lower Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score, lower gait speed, lower grip strength and abnormal (low or elevated) body mass index. Additional risk factors for men included current smoking, and abnormal eGFR. In women, diabetes and depression were additional predictors. The biased-corrected areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the final prognostic models at 5 years were 0.72 for men and 0.75 for women. Final models showed good calibration between the observed and predicted risks. We developed a prediction model in which age, cognitive function and gait speed were the strongest predictors of disability-free survival in healthy older people.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01038583).","['Disability', 'Elderly', 'Healthy', 'Public Health', 'Risk prediction', 'Survival']",GeroScience,2022-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Neumann', 'firstname': 'Johannes Tobias', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, 99 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, 3004, Australia.

2730794",Healthy lifestyle and life expectancy with and without Alzheimer's dementia: population based cohort study.,"To determine the impact of lifestyle factors on life expectancy lived with and without Alzheimer's dementia.
Prospective cohort study.
The Chicago Health and Aging Project, a population based cohort study in the United States.
2449 men and women aged 65 years and older.
A healthy lifestyle score was developed based on five modifiable lifestyle factors: a diet for brain health (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay-MIND diet score in upper 40% of cohort distribution), late life cognitive activities (composite score in upper 40%), moderate or vigorous physical activity (≥150 min/week), no smoking, and light to moderate alcohol consumption (women 1-15 g/day; men 1-30 g/day).
Life expectancy with and without Alzheimer's dementia in women and men.
Women aged 65 with four or five healthy factors had a life expectancy of 24.2 years (95% confidence interval 22.8 to 25.5) and lived 3.1 years longer than women aged 65 with zero or one healthy factor (life expectancy 21.1 years, 19.5 to 22.4). Of the total life expectancy at age 65, women with four or five healthy factors spent 10.8% (2.6 years, 2.0 to 3.3) of their remaining years with Alzheimer's dementia, whereas women with zero or one healthy factor spent 19.3% (4.1 years, 3.2 to 5.1) with the disease. Life expectancy for women aged 65 without Alzheimer's dementia and four or five healthy factors was 21.5 years (20.0 to 22.7), and for those with zero or one healthy factor it was 17.0 years (15.5 to 18.3). Men aged 65 with four or five healthy factors had a total life expectancy of 23.1 years (21.4 to 25.6), which is 5.7 years longer than men aged 65 with zero or one healthy factor (life expectancy 17.4 years, 15.8 to 20.1). Of the total life expectancy at age 65, men with four or five healthy factors spent 6.1% (1.4 years, 0.3 to 2.0) of their remaining years with Alzheimer's dementia, and those with zero or one healthy factor spent 12.0% (2.1 years, 0.2 to 3.0) with the disease. Life expectancy for men aged 65 without Alzheimer's dementia and four or five healthy factors was 21.7 years (19.7 to 24.9), and for those with zero or one healthy factor life expectancy was 15.3 years (13.4 to 19.1).

29179578",Overall and sex-specific risk factors for subjective cognitive decline: findings from the 2015-2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey.,"Prior research indicates that at least 35% of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia risk may be amenable to prevention. Subjective cognitive decline is often the first indication of preclinical dementia, with the risk of subsequent Alzheimer's disease in such individuals being greater in women than men. We wished to understand how modifiable factors are associated with subjective cognitive decline, and whether differences exist by sex.
Data were collected from men and women (45 years and older) who completed the U.S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Cognitive Decline Module (2015-2018), n = 216,838. We calculated population-attributable fractions for subjective cognitive decline, stratified by sex, of the following factors: limited education, deafness, social isolation, depression, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Our models were adjusted for age, race, income, employment, marital and Veteran status, and accounted for communality among risk factors.
The final study sample included more women (53.7%) than men, but both had a similar prevalence of subjective cognitive decline (10.6% of women versus 11.2% of men). Women and men had nearly equivalent overall population-attributable fractions to explain subjective cognitive decline (39.7% for women versus 41.3% for men). The top three contributing risk factors were social isolation, depression, and hypertension, which explained three-quarters of the overall population-attributable fraction.
While we did not identify any differences in modifiable factors between men and women contributing to subjective cognitive decline, other factors including reproductive or endocrinological health history or biological factors that interact with sex to modify risk warrant further research.","['Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Cognitive dysfunction', 'Dementia', 'Risk factors', 'Sex factors', 'Subjective cognitive decline']",Biology of sex differences,2022-04-14,"[{'lastname': 'Schliep', 'firstname': 'Karen C', 'initials': 'KC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, 375 Chipeta Way, Suite A, Salt Lake City, UT, 84108, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbeau', 'firstname': 'William A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lynch', 'firstname': 'Kristine E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sorweid', 'firstname': 'Michelle K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gerontology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Varner', 'firstname': 'Michael W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Foster', 'firstname': 'Norman L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Qeadan', 'firstname': 'Fares', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA. fqeadan@luc.edu.\nDepartment of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University Chicago, Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, 2160 S 1st Ave, Maywood, IL, 60153, USA. fqeadan@luc.edu.'}]",,,"The final study sample included more women (53.7%) than men, but both had a similar prevalence of subjective cognitive decline (10.6% of women versus 11.2% of men).

240,35404275,Age- and Sex-Associated Glucose Metabolism Decline in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a high etiological and clinical heterogeneity, which has obscured the diagnostic and treatment efficacy, as well as limited the development of potential drugs. Sex differences are among the risk factors that contribute to the variability of disease manifestation. Unlike men, women are at greater risk of developing AD and suffer from higher cognitive deterioration, together with important changes in pathological features. Alterations in glucose metabolism are emerging as a key player in the pathogenesis of AD, which appear even decades before the presence of clinical symptoms.
We aimed to study whether AD-related sex differences influence glucose metabolism.
We used male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice of different ages to examine glucose metabolism effects on AD development.
Our analysis suggests an age-dependent decline of metabolic responses, cognitive functions, and brain energy homeostasis, together with an increase of Aβ levels in both males and females APP/PS1 mice. The administration of Andrographolide (Andro), an anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic compound, was able to restore several metabolic disturbances, including the glycolytic and the pentose phosphate pathway fluxes, ATP levels, AMPKα activity, and Glut3 expression in 8-month-old mice, independent of the sex, while rescuing these abnormalities only in older females. Similarly, Andro also prevented Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline in all but old males.
Our study provides insight into the heterogeneity of the disease and supports the use of Andro as a potential drug to promote personalized medicine in AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'andrographolide', 'glucose metabolism', 'neuroprotection', 'sex differences']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-04-12,"[{'lastname': 'Gherardelli', 'firstname': 'Camila', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centro de Envejecimiento y Regeneración (CARE-UC), Departamento de Biología Celular y Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.'}, {'lastname': 'Cisternas', 'firstname': 'Pedro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Instituto de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de O'Higgins, Rancagua, Chile.""}, {'lastname': 'Vera-Salazar', 'firstname': 'Roberto F', 'initials': 'RF', 'affiliation': 'Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias Médicas.

241,35393913,The Triglycerides and Glucose Index Is Associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults.,"It has been reported that insulin resistance is related to cognitive decline. The triglycerides and glucose (TyG) index, is a reliable and inexpensive surrogate test for detecting insulin resistance.
The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between the TyG index and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older adults.
A total of 135 individuals, men and women aged 60 to 90 years, were enrolled in a case and control study. Individuals with a diagnosis of MCI (n = 65) were allocated into the case group and compared with individuals without MCI (n = 70) in the control group. Alcohol intake, diabetes duration ≥5 years, diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease, brain injury, folic acid deficiency, dementia, moderate or severe CI, major depressive disorders, and thyroid disease were exclusion criteria.
Individuals in the case group exhibited higher waist circumference (97.9 ± 13.9

29956129",Reproductive factors and the risk of incident dementia: A cohort study of UK Biobank participants.,"Women's reproductive factors have been associated with the risk of dementia; however, these findings remain uncertain. This study aimed to examine the risk of incident all-cause dementia associated with reproductive factors in women and the number of children in both sexes and whether the associations vary by age, socioeconomic status (SES), smoking status, and body mass index (BMI) in the UK Biobank.
A total of 273,240 women and 228,957 men without prevalent dementia from the UK Biobank were included in the analyses. Cox proportional hazard regressions estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for reproductive factors with incident all-cause dementia. Multiple adjusted models included age at study entry, SES, ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, BMI, history of diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, antihypertensive drugs, and lipid-lowering drugs. Over a median of 11.8 years follow-up, 1,866 dementia cases were recorded in women and 2,202 in men. Multiple adjusted HRs ((95% confidence intervals (CIs)), p-value) for dementia were 1.20 (1.08, 1.34) (p = 0.016) for menarche <12 years and 1.19 (1.07, 1.34) (p = 0.024) for menarche >14 years compared to 13 years; 0.85 (0.74, 0.98) (p = 0.026) for ever been pregnant; 1.43 (1.26, 1.62) (p < 0.001) for age at first live birth <21 compared to 25 to 26 years; 0.82 (0.71, 0.94) (p = 0.006) for each abortion; 1.32 (1.15, 1.51) (p = 0.008) for natural menopause at <47 compared to 50 years; 1.12 (1.01, 1.25) (p = 0.039) for hysterectomy; 2.35 (1.06, 5.23) (p = 0.037) for hysterectomy with previous oophorectomy; and 0.80 (0.72, 0.88) (p < 0.001) for oral contraceptive pills use. The U-shaped associations between the number of children and the risk of dementia were similar for both sexes: Compared with those with 2 children, for those without children, the multiple adjusted HR ((95% CIs), p-value) was 1.18 (1.04, 1.33) (p = 0.027) for women and 1.10 (0.98, 1.23) (p = 0.164) for men, and the women-to-men ratio of HRs was 1.09 (0.92, 1.28) (p = 0.403); for those with 4 or more children, the HR was 1.14 (0.98, 1.33) (p = 0.132) for women and 1.26 (1.10, 1.45) (p = 0.003) for men, and the women-to-men ratio of HRs was 0.93 (0.76, 1.14) (p = 0.530). There was evidence that hysterectomy (HR, 1.31 (1.09, 1.59), p = 0.013) and oophorectomy (HR, 1.39 (1.08, 1.78), p = 0.002) were associated with a higher risk of dementia among women of relatively lower SES only. Limitations of the study include potential residual confounding and self-reported measures of reproductive factors, as well as the limited representativeness of the UK Biobank population.
In this study, we observed that some reproductive events related to shorter cumulative endogenous estrogen exposure in women were associated with higher dementia risk, and there was a similar association between the number of children and dementia risk between women and men.",[],PLoS medicine,2022-04-06,"[{'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Newtown, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Newtown, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Peters', 'firstname': 'Sanne A E', 'initials': 'SAE', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Newtown, New South Wales, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.\nJulius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodward', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Newtown, New South Wales, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pmed.1003955

17479585",Foot and ankle Osteoarthritis and Cognitive impairment in retired UK Soccer players (FOCUS): protocol for a cross-sectional comparative study with general population controls.,"Professional footballers commonly experience sports-related injury and repetitive microtrauma to the foot and ankle, placing them at risk of subsequent chronic pain and osteoarthritis (OA) of the foot and ankle. Similarly, repeated heading of the ball, head/neck injuries and concussion have been implicated in later development of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. A recent retrospective study found that death from neurodegenerative diseases was higher among former professional soccer players compared with age matched controls. However, well-designed lifetime studies are still needed to provide evidence regarding the prevalence of these conditions and their associated risk factors in retired professional football players compared with the general male population.
To determine whether former professional male footballers have a higher prevalence than the general male population of: (1) foot/ankle pain and radiographic OA; and (2) cognitive and motor impairments associated with dementia and Parkinson's disease. Secondary objectives are to identify specific football-related risk factors such as head impact/concussion for neurodegenerative conditions and foot/ankle injuries for chronic foot/ankle pain and OA.
This is a cross-sectional, comparative study involving a questionnaire survey with subsamples of responders being assessed for cognitive function by telephone assessment, and foot/ankle OA by radiographic examination. A sample of 900 adult, male, ex professional footballers will be recruited and compared with a control group of 1100 age-matched general population men between 40 and 100 years old. Prevalence will be estimated per group. Poisson regression will be performed to determine prevalence ratio between the populations and logistic regression will be used to examine risk factors associated with each condition in footballers.
This study was approved by the East Midlands-Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee on 23 January 2020 (REC ref: 19/EM/0354). The study results will be disseminated at national and international meetings and submitted for peer-review publication.","['Dementia', 'EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'RHEUMATOLOGY', 'SPORTS MEDICINE']",BMJ open,2022-04-06,"[{'lastname': 'Espahbodi', 'firstname': 'Shima', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK shima.espahbodi1@nottingham.ac.uk.\nCentre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis Versus Arthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernandes', 'firstname': 'Gwen', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK.\nPopulation Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hogervorst', 'firstname': 'Eef', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'NCSEM, School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Thanoon', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK.\nCentre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis Versus Arthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Batt', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis Versus Arthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\nSports Medicine, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuller', 'firstname': 'Colin W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Colin Fuller Consultancy Ltd, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuller', 'firstname': 'Gordon', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Urgent and Emergency Research, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferguson', 'firstname': 'Eamonn', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bast', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK.\nNeuroscience@Nottingham, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Doherty', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK.\nCentre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis Versus Arthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Weiya', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Academic Rheumatology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK.\nCentre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis Versus Arthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}]",,,,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

26196252",Endogenous and Exogenous Estrogen Exposures: How Women's Reproductive Health Can Drive Brain Aging and Inform Alzheimer's Prevention.,"After advanced age, female sex is the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia affecting over 24 million people worldwide. The prevalence of AD is higher in women than in men, with postmenopausal women accounting for over 60% of all those affected. While most research has focused on gender-combined risk, emerging data indicate sex and gender differences in AD pathophysiology, onset, and progression, which may help account for the higher prevalence in women. Notably, AD-related brain changes develop during a 10-20 year prodromal phase originating in midlife, thus proximate with the hormonal transitions of endocrine aging characteristic of the menopause transition in women. Preclinical evidence for neuroprotective effects of gonadal sex steroid hormones, especially 17β-estradiol, strongly argue for associations between female fertility, reproductive history, and AD risk. The level of gonadal hormones to which the female brain is exposed changes considerably across the lifespan, with relevance to AD risk. However, the neurobiological consequences of hormonal fluctuations, as well as that of hormone therapies, are yet to be fully understood. Epidemiological studies have yielded contrasting results of protective, deleterious and null effects of estrogen exposure on dementia risk. In contrast, brain imaging studies provide encouraging evidence for positive associations between greater cumulative lifetime estrogen exposure and lower AD risk in women, whereas estrogen deprivation is associated with negative consequences on brain structure, function, and biochemistry. Herein, we review the existing literature and evaluate the strength of observed associations between female-specific reproductive health factors and AD risk in women, with a focus on the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposures as a key underlying mechanism. Chief among these variables are reproductive lifespan, menopause status, type of menopause (spontaneous vs. induced), number of pregnancies, and exposure to hormonal therapy, including hormonal contraceptives, hormonal therapy for menopause, and anti-estrogen treatment. As aging is the greatest risk factor for AD followed by female sex, understanding sex-specific biological pathways through which reproductive history modulates brain aging is crucial to inform preventative and therapeutic strategies for AD.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'hormones', 'menopause', 'reproductive history', 'risk factors', 'sex differences']",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Jett', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Malviya', 'firstname': 'Niharika', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Schelbaum', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Jang', 'firstname': 'Grace', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Jahan', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Clancy', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hristov', 'firstname': 'Hollie', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Pahlajani', 'firstname': 'Silky', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.\nDepartment of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Niotis', 'firstname': 'Kellyann', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Loeb-Zeitlin', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Havryliuk', 'firstname': 'Yelena', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Isaacson', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Brinton', 'firstname': 'Roberta Diaz', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Mosconi', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.\nDepartment of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2022 Jett, Malviya, Schelbaum, Jang, Jahan, Clancy, Hristov, Pahlajani, Niotis, Loeb-Zeitlin, Havryliuk, Isaacson, Brinton and Mosconi.","10.3389/fnagi.2022.831807

30370616",Dynapenic abdominal obesity is associated with mild cognitive impairment in patients with cardiometabolic disease: a cross-sectional study.,"Dementia is an important health issue for older people and requires early intervention in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage to manage risk factors. Both dynapenia (DP) and abdominal obesity (AO) are associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Therefore, in this cross-sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the association between MCI and dynapenic abdominal obesity (DAO), a combination of DP and AO.
A total of 417 older outpatients with cardiometabolic diseases without severe cognitive impairment were studied to compare cognitive function in four groups: control, DP, AO, and DAO groups. DAO was defined as the combination of DP (handgrip strength of < 28 kg and < 18 kg in men and women, respectively) and AO (waist circumference of ≥ 85 cm and ≥ 90 cm in men and women, respectively). MCI was defined as a score of ≤ 25 in the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine if MCI was independently associated with DAO, low handgrip strength, or high waist circumference.
The DAO group obtained the lowest cognitive test scores and had the highest prevalence of MCI. Furthermore, after adjusting for covariates, the logistic regression analysis showed that patients in the DAO group were at an increased risk of MCI (odds ratio [OR] = 3.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-13.77). Further logistic regression analyses revealed that both low handgrip strength (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.11-4.29) and high waist circumference (OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.03-3.99) were associated with MCI.
DAO, which can be easily diagnosed by a combination of handgrip strength and waist circumference, was associated with MCI in patents with cardiometabolic metabolic disease. This study suggests that screening for MCI in DAO patients could be important for early intervention of dementia prevention.","['Cardiometabolic disease', 'Dynapenia', 'Dynapenic abdominal obesity', 'Handgrip strength', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Waist circumference']",BMC geriatrics,2022-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Oba', 'firstname': 'Kazuhito', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan. kazuhito_oba@tmghig.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Tamura', 'firstname': 'Yoshiaki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ishikawa', 'firstname': 'Joji', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Hiroyuki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujiwara', 'firstname': 'Yoshinori', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tachibana', 'firstname': 'Aya', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kodera', 'firstname': 'Remi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Toyoshima', 'firstname': 'Kenji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chiba', 'firstname': 'Yuko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Araki', 'firstname': 'Atsushi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.'}]",,,"The DAO group obtained the lowest cognitive test scores and had the highest prevalence of MCI.

31964160","Post-Stroke Depression and Cognitive Aging: A Multicenter, Prospective Cohort Study.","Background: This study investigated the impact of post-stroke depression (PSD) on cognitive aging in elderly stroke patients. Methods: This study was an interim analysis of the Korean Stroke Cohort for Functioning and Rehabilitation. Among 10,636 patients with first-ever stroke, a total of 3215 patients with normal cognitive function three months post-stroke were included in the analysis. PSD was defined using the Korean Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (K-GDS-SF) at three months. Cognitive aging was defined as a decline in the Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE) score to less than the second percentile. Results: The hazard ratio (HR) of PSD for cognitive decline was 2.16 (95% CI, 1.34−3.50, p < 0.01) in the older group (age ≥65 years), and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.50−2.07, n.s.) in the younger group (age <65 years). When the older group was divided by sex, the HR was 2.50 (95% CI, 1.26−4.96, p < 0.01) in male patients and 1.80 (95% CI, 0.93−3.51, n.s.) in female patients. However, women showed a higher incidence of cognitive decline in both the PSD and no PSD groups. Among K-GDS-SF factors, “Negative judgment about the past, present, and future” increased the HR of PSD in older male patients. Conclusions: Early PSD increased the HR for cognitive decline in older stroke patients, mainly in males. Specifically, older male patients with negative thinking were at increased risk of cognitive decline. The findings also suggest that older women may be at risk for cognitive decline. Therefore, preventive interventions for cognitive decline should be tailored differently for men and women.","['cognitive decline', 'dementia', 'older adults', 'post-stroke depression', 'stroke']",Journal of personalized medicine,2022-03-26,"[{'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Minyoung', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Center for Prevention and Rehabilitation, Heart Vascular Stroke Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.\nDepartment of Counseling Psychology, Seoul Graduate School of Counseling Psychology, Seoul 03136, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Sohn', 'firstname': 'Min Kyun', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, School of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jongmin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul 05030, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Deog Young', 'initials': 'DY', 'affiliation': 'Department and Research Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Yong-Il', 'initials': 'YI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan 46241, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Oh', 'firstname': 'Gyung-Jae', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan 51538, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Yang-Soo', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu 41566, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Joo', 'firstname': 'Min Cheol', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan 51538, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'So Young', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Jeju National University School of Medicine, Jeju 63243, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Min-Keun', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Kwangju 61186, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Junhee', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Hallym University, Chunchon 24252, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahn', 'firstname': 'Jeonghoon', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Convergence, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 03760, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Young-Hoon', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan 51538, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Won Hyuk', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Center for Prevention and Rehabilitation, Heart Vascular Stroke Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Seyoung', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Center for Prevention and Rehabilitation, Heart Vascular Stroke Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Soo Mi', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Chronic Disease Prevention, Center for Disease, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Cheongju 28159, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Seon Kui', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Chronic Disease Prevention, Center for Disease, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Cheongju 28159, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yun-Hee', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Center for Prevention and Rehabilitation, Heart Vascular Stroke Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.\nSamsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences & Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 03063, Korea.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/jpm12030389

25905840",Pathways explaining racial/ethnic disparities in incident all-cause and Alzheimer's disease dementia among older US men and women.,"Racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and all-cause dementia (DEMENTIA) incidence may exist differentially among men and women, with unknown mechanisms.
A retrospective cohort study examining all-cause and AD dementia incidence was conducted linking Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare data over ≤26 years of follow-up (1988 to 2014). Cox regression and generalized structural equation models (GSEMs) were constructed among men and women ≥60 years of age at baseline (N = 4592). Outcomes included onset ages of all-cause and AD dementia, whereas the main exposures were race/ethnicity contrasts (RACE_ETHN). Potential mediators) included socio-economic status (SES), lifestyle factors (dietary quality [DIET] nutritional biomarkers [NUTR], physical activity [PA], social support [SS], alcohol [ALCOHOL], poor health [or HEALTH], poor cognitive performance [or COGN]. In addition to RACE_ETHN, the following were exogenous covariates in the GSEM and potential confounders in Cox models: age, sex, urban-rural, household size, and marital status.
Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women had a higher risk of DEMENTIA versus non-Hispanic White (NHW) women in GSEM, consistent with Cox models (age-adjusted model: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.61). The total effect of this RACE_ETHN contrast in women was explained by four main pathways: (1) RACE_ETHN→ poor cognitive performance (COGN, +) → DEMENTIA (+); (2) RACE_ETHN → SES (-) → COGN (-) → DEMENTIA (+); (3) RACE_ETHN → SES (-) → physical activity (PA, +) → COGN (-) → DEMENTIA (+); and (4) RACE_ETHN → SES (-) → DIET (+) → COGN (-) → DEMENTIA (+). A reduced AD risk in Mexican American (MA) women versus NHW women upon adjustment for SES and downstream factors (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.80).

29630246",StatPearls,"Family and domestic violence (including child abuse, intimate partner abuse, and elder abuse) is a common problem in the United States and Florida. Family and domestic health violence are estimated to affect 10 million people in the United States every year. It is a national public health problem, and virtually all healthcare professionals will at some point evaluate or treat a patient who is a victim of some form of domestic or family violence. Unfortunately, each form of family violence begets interrelated forms of violence, and the ""cycle of abuse"" is often continued from exposed children into their adult relationships, and finally to the care of the elderly. Domestic and family violence include a range of abuse including economic, physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological toward children, adults, and elders. Intimate partner violence includes stalking, sexual and physical violence, and psychological aggression by a current or former partner. In the United States, as many as one in four women and one in nine men are victims of domestic violence. Domestic violence is thought to be underreported. Domestic violence affects the victim, families, co-workers, and community. It causes diminished psychological and physical health, decreases the quality of life, and results in decreased productivity. The national economic cost of domestic and family violence is estimated to be over 12 billion dollars per year. The numbers of individuals affected is expected to rise over the next 20 years with the increase in the elderly population. Domestic and family violence is difficult to identify, and many cases go unreported to health professionals or legal authorities. Due to the prevalence in our society, all healthcare professionals, including psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and physicians will at some point evaluate and possibly treat a victim or perpetrator of domestic or family violence.

25455628",Association of Adverse Childhood Experiences With Poor Neuropsychiatric Health and Dementia Among Former Professional US Football Players.,"Childhood adversities, including neglect, abuse, and other indicators of family dysfunction, are associated in adulthood with risk factors for poor cognitive and mental health. However, the extent to which these experiences are associated with adulthood cognition-related quality of life and risk for dementia is unknown.
To determine the association of 10 adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with neuropsychiatric outcomes among former National Football League (NFL) players.
This cross-sectional analysis used data from the Football Player's Health Study at Harvard University, an ongoing longitudinal cohort study from January 30, 2015, to November 19, 2021, of former NFL players.
Ten ACEs were assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire.
Dementia symptoms were assessed using the AD8: The Washington University Dementia Screening Test; cognition-related quality of life was assessed with the short form of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders; depression was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; anxiety was assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; and pain intensity and pain interference in daily life were assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory. Risk ratios (RRs) assessing the association between ACEs and neuropsychiatric outcomes were estimated using generalized estimating equations, adjusted for age, race, and childhood socioeconomic status, and further adjusted for playing position, concussions incurred during football play, and number of seasons played in the NFL.
A total of 1755 men (mean [SD] age, 57.2 [13.5] years) who were former professional football players were included in the analysis. Five hundred twenty players (29.6%) identified as Black, 1160 (66.1%) identified as White, and 75 (4.3%) identified as other race or ethnicity. Players with 4 or more ACEs were at 48% greater risk of a positive screen for dementia (RR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.22-1.79]), and at significantly greater risk of every other neuropsychiatric outcome except anxiety (RR range, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.09-2.39] to 1.74 [95% CI, 1.27-2.40]) compared with players with no ACEs. Further adjustment for concussions incurred during playing years attenuated these associations, although some were still significant (adjusted RR range, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.10-1.58] to 1.56 [95% CI, 1.15-2.11]). ACEs were also associated with concussion symptoms; players with 4 or more ACEs had a 60% increased risk of being in the top quartile of concussion symptoms (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.12-2.28) compared with players with no ACEs.
These findings suggest that ACEs may be associated with dementia symptoms among former NFL players. Moreover, ACEs should be investigated among professional football players and other populations as a prospective indicator of persons at high risk of concussion. These findings further suggest that treatment of psychological trauma in addition to treatment of physical injury may improve neuropsychiatric health in former NFL players.",[],JAMA network open,2022-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Roberts', 'firstname': 'Andrea L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.

28138135",Work stress and loss of years lived without chronic disease: an 18-year follow-up of 1.5 million employees in Denmark.,"We aimed to examine the association between exposure to work stress and chronic disease incidence and loss of chronic disease-free life years in the Danish workforce. The study population included 1,592,491 employees, aged 30-59 in 2000 and without prevalent chronic diseases. We assessed work stress as the combination of job strain and effort-reward imbalance using job exposure matrices. We used Cox regressions to estimate risk of incident hospital-diagnoses or death of chronic diseases (i.e., type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and dementia) during 18 years of follow-up and calculated corresponding chronic disease-free life expectancy from age 30 to age 75. Individuals working in occupations with high prevalence of work stress had a higher risk of incident chronic disease compared to those in occupations with low prevalence of work stress (women: HR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.05), men: HR 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14)). The corresponding loss in chronic disease-free life expectancy was 0.25 (95% CI - 0.10 to 0.60) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.56-1.11) years in women and men, respectively. Additional adjustment for health behaviours attenuated these associations among men. We conclude that men working in high-stress occupations have a small loss of years lived without chronic disease compared to men working in low-stress occupations. This finding appeared to be partially attributable to harmful health behaviours. In women, high work stress indicated a very small and statistically non-significant loss of years lived without chronic disease.","['Chronic disease', 'Effort-reward imbalance', 'Job strain', 'Life expectancy', 'Register-based research', 'Work stress']",European journal of epidemiology,2022-03-22,"[{'lastname': 'Sørensen', 'firstname': 'Jeppe K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'National Research Centre for the Working Environment, Lersø Parkalle 105, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. jks@nrcwe.dk.'}, {'lastname': 'Framke', 'firstname': 'Elisabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'National Research Centre for the Working Environment, Lersø Parkalle 105, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Pedersen', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'National Research Centre for the Working Environment, Lersø Parkalle 105, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Alexanderson', 'firstname': 'Kristina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Insurance Medicine, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Bonde', 'firstname': 'Jens P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Bispebjerg Bakke 23F, 2400, Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.\nDepartment of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Øster Farimagsgade 5, 1014, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Farrants', 'firstname': 'Kristin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Insurance Medicine, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Flachs', 'firstname': 'Esben M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Bispebjerg Bakke 23F, 2400, Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Magnusson Hanson', 'firstname': 'Linda L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': 'Stress Research Institute at Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, Frescati Hagväg 16A, 114 19, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Nyberg', 'firstname': 'Solja T', 'initials': 'ST', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Yliopistonkatu 3, 00014, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kivimäki', 'firstname': 'Mika', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Yliopistonkatu 3, 00014, Helsinki, Finland.\nFinnish Institute of Occupational Health, Topeliuksenkatu 41 B, 00250, Helsinki, Finland.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College of London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London, WC1E 6BT, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Madsen', 'firstname': 'Ida E H', 'initials': 'IEH', 'affiliation': 'National Research Centre for the Working Environment, Lersø Parkalle 105, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Rugulies', 'firstname': 'Reiner', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'National Research Centre for the Working Environment, Lersø Parkalle 105, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Øster Farimagsgade 5, 1014, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Copenhagen, Øster Farimagsgade 2A, 1353, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]",,,,© 2022.

32123386","Long-term associations between amyloid positron emission tomography, sex, apolipoprotein E and incident dementia and mortality among individuals without dementia: hazard ratios and absolute risk.","Dementia and mortality rates rise inexorably with age and consequently interact. However, because of the major logistical difficulties in accounting for both outcomes in a defined population, very little work has examined how risk factors and biomarkers for incident dementia are influenced by competing mortality. The objective of this study was to examine long-term associations between amyloid PET, APOE ɛ4, sex, education and cardiovascular/metabolic conditions, and hazard and absolute risk of dementia and mortality in individuals without dementia at enrolment. Participants were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a population-based study of cognitive ageing in Olmsted County, MN, USA. All were without dementia and were age 55-92 years at enrolment and were followed longitudinally. Predictor variables were amyloid PET, APOE ɛ4 status, sex, education, cardiovascular/metabolic conditions and age. The main outcomes were incident dementia and mortality. Multivariable, multi-state models were used to estimate mortality and incident dementia rates and absolute risk of dementia and mortality by predictor variable group. Of the 4984 participants in the study, 4336 (87%) were cognitively unimpaired and 648 (13%) had mild cognitive impairment at enrolment. The median age at enrolment was 75 years; 2463 (49%) were women. The median follow-up time was 9.4 years (7.5 years after PET). High versus normal amyloid (hazard ratio 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.43-2.79), APOE ɛ4 (women: hazard ratio 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.80-2.77; men: hazard ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.71), older age and two additional cardiovascular/metabolic conditions (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.22-1.53) were associated with the increased hazard of dementia (all ","['APOE', 'amyloid PET', 'dementia', 'mortality', 'sex']",Brain communications,2022-03-22,"[{'lastname': 'Jack', 'firstname': 'Clifford R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Therneau', 'firstname': 'Terry M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lundt', 'firstname': 'Emily S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiste', 'firstname': 'Heather J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mielke', 'firstname': 'Michelle M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Knopman', 'firstname': 'David S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Graff-Radford', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lowe', 'firstname': 'Val J', 'initials': 'VJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vemuri', 'firstname': 'Prashanthi', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwarz', 'firstname': 'Christopher G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Senjem', 'firstname': 'Matthew L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gunter', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersen', 'firstname': 'Ronald C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}]",,,,© The Author(s) 2022.

31602119",Prevalence and risk factors of fall-related injury among older adults in India: evidence from a cross-sectional observational study.,"Falls and related injuries in older ages have become a major public health problem. This study aims to identify the prevalence of self-reported fall-related injury and to describe risk factors associated with fall-related injury among older adults in India.
The study used data from the ""Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India"" (BKPAI), which was carried out in seven major states in India (2011). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the prevalence and risk factors of fall-related injury among older people.
The study found that 3.6% of older adults had a fall-related injury. Older adults with walk difficulty had a significantly higher likelihood of reporting fall-related injuries in comparison to their counterparts [adjusted odds ratio (AOR):1.80; confidence interval (CI): 1.38-2.36]. Older adults who consumed alcohol had significantly higher odds of reporting fall-related injuries than those who did not consume alcohol [AOR: 1.97; CI: 1.31-2.97]. Poor self-rated health was another risk factor for fall-related injury [AOR: 1.24; CI: 1.05-1.61]. Further, older adults with dementia were 2.15 times significantly more likely to report fall-related injuries than older adults with no dementia [AOR: 2.15; CI: 1.03-5.05]. Also, older women compared to men were 98% significantly more likely to report fall-related injury [AOR: 1.98; CI: 1.43-2.75]. The odds of reporting fall-related injury was significantly higher among those who had a secondary level education compared to those with no education [AOR: 1.44; CI: 1.01-2.06].
Walking disabilities, alcohol consumption, poor self-rated health, dementia, and female gender were found to be the risk factors for fall-related injury among older adults. The results highlight the importance of improving physical as well as mental health of older individuals including dementia in terms of reducing the risk of experiencing fall-related injury.","['Fall-related injury', 'India', 'Older adult', 'Risk factors']",BMC public health,2022-03-21,"[{'lastname': 'Srivastava', 'firstname': 'Shobhit', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400088, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Muhammad', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400088, India. muhammad.iips@gmail.com.'}]","The study used data from the ""Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India"" (BKPAI), which was carried out in seven major states in India (2011).

18657855",Prevalence of parkinsonism and Parkinson disease in urban and rural populations from Latin America: A community based study.,"Age and gender specific prevalence rates for parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD) are important to guide research, clinical practice, and public health planning; however, prevalence estimates in Latin America (LatAm) are limited. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of parkinsonism and PD and examine related risk factors in a cohort of elderly individuals from Latin America (LatAm).
Data from 11,613 adults (65+ years) who participated in a baseline assessment of the 10/66 study and lived in six LatAm countries were analyzed to estimate parkinsonism and PD prevalence. Crude and age-adjusted prevalence were determined by sex and country. Diagnosis of PD was established using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank's clinical criteria.
In this cohort, the prevalence of parkinsonism was 8.0% (95% CI 7.6%-8.5%), and the prevalence of PD was 2.0% (95% CI 1.7%-2.3%). PD prevalence increased with age from 1.0 to 3.5 (65-69vs. 80 years or older, 
The reported prevalence of PD in LatAm is similar to reports from high-income countries (HIC). A significant proportion of cases with PD did not have a previous diagnosis, nor did they seek any medical or neurological attention. These findings underscore the need to improve public health programs for populations currently undergoing rapid demographic aging and epidemiological transition.
The funding source had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.","['Latin America', ""Parkinson's disease"", 'Parkinsonism', 'Prevalence', 'Risk factors']",Lancet regional health.

6610841",Alzheimer's Disease: Epidemiology and Clinical Progression.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is prevalent throughout the world and is the leading cause of dementia in older individuals (aged ≥ 65 years). To gain a deeper understanding of the recent literature on the epidemiology of AD and its progression, we conducted a review of the PubMed-indexed literature (2014-2021) in North America, Europe, and Asia. The worldwide toll of AD is evidenced by rising prevalence, incidence, and mortality due to AD-estimates which are low because of underdiagnosis of AD. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD can ultimately progress to AD dementia; estimates of AD dementia etiology among patients with MCI range from 40% to 75% depending on the populations studied and whether the MCI diagnosis was made clinically or in combination with biomarkers. The risk of AD dementia increases with progression from normal cognition with no amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation to early neurodegeneration and subsequently to MCI. For patients with Aβ accumulation and neurodegeneration, lifetime risk of AD dementia has been estimated to be 41.9% among women and 33.6% among men. Data on progression from preclinical AD to MCI are sparse, but an analysis of progression across the three preclinical National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) stages suggests that NIA-AA stage 3 (subtle cognitive decline with AD biomarker positivity) could be useful in combination with other tools for treatment decision-making. Factors shown to increase risk include lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, higher Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) score, positive APOE4 status, white matter hyperintensities volume, entorhinal cortex atrophy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau, CSF neurogranin levels, dependency in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and being female. Results suggest that use of biomarkers alongside neurocognitive tests will become an important part of clinical practice as new disease-modifying therapies are introduced.","['Alzheimer’s Disease', 'Clinical Progression', 'Dementia', 'Epidemiology', 'Mild Cognitive Impairment', 'Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease']",Neurology and therapy,2022-03-15,"[{'lastname': 'Tahami Monfared', 'firstname': 'Amir Abbas', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Eisai, 200 Metro Blvd, Nutley, NJ, 07110, USA. amir_tahami@eisai.com.\nEpidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada. amir_tahami@eisai.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Byrnes', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Evidera, Waltham, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'White', 'firstname': 'Leigh Ann', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Evidera, Waltham, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Quanwu', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Eisai, 200 Metro Blvd, Nutley, NJ, 07110, USA.'}]",,,,© 2022.

26077041","Incident Gout: Risk of Death and Cause-Specific Mortality in Western Sweden: A Prospective, Controlled Inception Cohort Study.","Excess mortality in gout has been attributed to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Considering the decline in CVD mortality in the general population, we wanted to evaluate overall mortality in gout and cause-specific contributions to mortality beyond CVD and temporal trends.
All incident cases of gout between 2006 and 2015 in western Sweden and 5 population controls per case matched for age, sex, and county were identified. Comorbidities were identified for 5 years preceding the index date. Follow-up ended at death, migration, or end of study on December 2017. Effect of gout on death risk was calculated using COX regression on the whole population and stratified by sex, adjusted for demographics, and comorbidities. Death incidence rates were compared between the two time periods, 2006-2010 and 2011-2015.
We identified 22,055 cases of incident gout and 98,946 controls, median age (Q1, Q3) 69-68 (57, 79/56, 78) years and 67.6-66.5% males. Except for dementia, all comorbidities were significantly more common at baseline among gout cases. Overall, the risk for death in incident gout was neither increased overall nor in men, but women had a 10% elevated risk. In adjusted models for cause-specific mortality, death from CVD, renal disease, and digestive system diseases were significantly increased in the total gout population while death from dementia, cancer, and lung diseases were significantly decreased. There were no significant differences in overall incident death rate ratios between cases and controls in the two time periods examined.
An increased risk for CVD, renal disease, and diseases of the digestive system in patients with gout highlights the importance of addressing CVD risk factors in gout management. Gout was associated with reduced mortality from dementia, which may have implications on urate lowering therapy and possible effects on dementia risk.","['case control study', 'cause of death', 'dementia', 'gout', 'mortality']",Frontiers in medicine,2022-03-15,"[{'lastname': 'Dehlin', 'firstname': 'Mats', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Sandström', 'firstname': 'Tatiana Zverkova', 'initials': 'TZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Jacobsson', 'firstname': 'Lennart Th', 'initials': 'LT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}]",,,"We identified 22,055 cases of incident gout and 98,946 controls, median age (Q1, Q3) 69-68 (57, 79/56, 78) years and 67.6-66.5% males.

26823182","Risk and incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes: the results from a longitudinal study in a community cohort of patients and an age and gender-matched control cohort in North Wales, UK.","The aim of the current investigation is to estimate the incidence and risk for neurocognitive disorders (NCD) in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohort with diabetes, compared with an age and sex-matched control cohort.
Longitudinal follow-up.
District general hospital North Wales, UK.
Ninety-two patients with CKD and an age and gender-matched sample of 143 controls at baseline and at approximately 36 months.
Cognitive function was assessed in the patients with CKD (mean age 75.8±9.1; 49 men: 43 women) and the control cohort (mean age 74.4±6.2; 71 men: 72) at baseline and at approximately 36 months. An NCD diagnosis was based on patient, informant, case note review, neuropsychological assessment and application of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders V.5 (DSM-5) for an NCD and Petersen's criteria for mild cognitive impairment.
Follow-up neuropsychological assessment and application of DSM-5 criteria of the cognitively normal patients and controls revealed, 25/92 (27%) of the CDK and 20/143 (13.9%) in the control cohort developed an NCD. The CKD cohort had a twofold increased risk for the development of an NCD compared with the controls, adjusted for age and sex. The incidence rate for an NCD in the CKD cohort was 10.5 and 5.1 in the controls, respectively. No association was observed with the stage of CKD and cognitive function.
This longitudinal investigation found that patients with CKD have a twofold increased risk for the development of an NCD. The current investigation highlighted the need to recognise that NCD in patients with CKD is a common comorbidity and that they are at a much higher risk for the development of a significant neurodegenerative disorders. In view of these risks, neuropsychological screening and assessment should be incorporated into normal CKD clinical practice and management.","['dementia', 'diabetes & endocrinology', 'epidemiology', 'nephrology']",BMJ open,2022-03-13,"[{'lastname': 'Hobson', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Glan Clwyd Hospital, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Rhyl, Denbighshire, UK peter.hobson@wales.nhs.uk.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumwenda', 'firstname': 'Mick', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Rhyl, Denbighshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Shrikanth', 'firstname': 'Siva', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Rhyl, Denbighshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Nair', 'firstname': 'Hari', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Rhyl, Denbighshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology & Diabetes, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Rhyl, Denbighshire, UK.'}]",,,"Follow-up neuropsychological assessment and application of DSM-5 criteria of the cognitively normal patients and controls revealed, 25/92 (27%) of the CDK and 20/143 (13.9%) in the control cohort developed an NCD.

29376854","Sex and Gender Differences in Environmental Influences on Dementia Incidence in Germany, 2014-2019: An Observational Cohort Study Based on Health Claims Data.","There is an ongoing debate about whether environmental characteristics influence dementia risk like individual traits do, and whether these differ by sex and gender.
This study examines the influence of regional characteristics on the incidence of dementia and explores sex and gender differences using individual-level health information and regional characteristics.
Using a random sample of 250,000 people aged 70 + insured through Germany's largest German public health agency, we analyzed quarterly data about diagnoses and place of residence from 2014 to 2019. Using five-digit postal codes, we added data on various dimensions of regional characteristics offered by the INKAR database and the 2011 Census database. We used multilevel survival regressions to tease out regional incidence differences while accounting for spatial clustering.
After adjusting for multi-morbidity and relocation-related selection bias, we saw that people living in regions with the highest tertile of income (HR = 0.87, p < 0.001), and who had the highest tertile of remaining life expectancy at age 60 (HR = 0.93, p = 0.012) had lower dementia risks. There was no gender difference in the regional income effect, but the effect of education (HR = 0.91, p = 0.015) was significant only for men and remaining life-expectancy was significant only for women (HR = 0.93, p = 0.026).
Environmental characteristics related to wealth and health resources of a region influence the risk of dementia among the elderly in Germany. This effect is independent of the health profiles of the individuals and differs between the two genders. Health policies need to acknowledge these modifiable risk factors and consider how they affect men and women differently.","['Cohort study', 'dementia', 'environment', 'gender', 'health inequality', 'incidence', 'multi-morbidity', 'multilevel analysis', 'routinely collected health data', 'sex', 'survival analysis']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022-03-12,"[{'lastname': 'Kreft', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Sociology and Demography, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.\nGerman Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Doblhammer', 'firstname': 'Gabriele', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Sociology and Demography, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.\nGerman Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.'}]",,Environmental characteristics related to wealth and health resources of a region influence the risk of dementia among the elderly in Germany.

260,35272949,Editor's Choice - Effect of Carotid Endarterectomy on 20 Year Incidence of Recorded Dementia: A Randomised Trial.,"Stroke and carotid atherosclerosis are associated with dementia. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces stroke risk, although its effect on later dementia is uncertain. Participants in the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST-1), randomly allocated to immediate vs. deferral of CEA (i.e., no intervention unless or until triggered by ipsilateral transient ischaemic attack or stroke), were followed, to study effects on dementia.
From 1993 to 2003, ACST-1 included 3 120 participants with asymptomatic tight carotid stenosis. All UK and Swedish patients (n = 1 601; 796 immediate vs. 805 deferral) were followed with trial records, national electronic health record linkage, and (UK only) by post and telephone. Cumulative incidence and competing risk analyses were used to measure the effects of risk factors and CEA on dementia risk. Intention to treat analyses yielded hazard ratios (HRs; immediate vs. deferral) of dementia.
The median follow up was 19.4 years (interquartile range 16.9 - 21.7). Dementia was recorded in 107 immediate CEA patients and 115 allocated delayed surgery; 1 290 patients died (1 091 [538 vs. 536] before any dementia diagnosis). Dementia incidence rose with age and with female sex (men: 8.3% aged < 70 years at trial entry vs. 15.1% aged ≥ 70; women: 15.1% aged < 70 years at trial entry vs. 22.4% aged ≥ 70 years) and was higher in those with pre-existing cerebral infarction (silent or with prior symptoms; 20.2% vs. 13.6%). Dementia risk was similar in both randomised groups: 6.7% vs. 6.6% at 10 years and 14.3% vs. 15.5% at 20 years, respectively. The dementia HR was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 - 1.28; p = .89), with no heterogeneity in the neutral effect of immediate CEA on dementia related to age, carotid stenosis, blood pressure, diabetes, country of residence, or medical treatments at trial entry (heterogeneity values p > .05).
CEA was not associated with significant reductions in the long term hazards of dementia, but the CI did not exclude a proportional benefit or hazard of about 25%.","['Carotid endarterectomy', 'Dementia', 'Long term follow up', 'National electronic health records', 'Randomised controlled trial', 'Stroke']",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,2022-03-12,"[{'lastname': 'Halliday', 'firstname': 'Alison', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

28846757","Age, sex and APOE-ε4 modify the balance between soluble and fibrillar β-amyloid in non-demented individuals: topographical patterns across two independent cohorts.","Amyloid (Aβ) pathology is the earliest detectable pathophysiological event along the Alzheimer's continuum, which can be measured both in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Yet, these biomarkers identify two distinct Aβ pools, reflecting the clearance of soluble Aβ as opposed to the presence of Aβ fibrils in the brain. An open question is whether risk factors known to increase Alzheimer's' disease (AD) prevalence may promote an imbalance between soluble and deposited Aβ. Unveiling such interactions shall aid our understanding of the biological pathways underlying Aβ deposition and foster the design of effective prevention strategies. We assessed the impact of three major AD risk factors, such as age, APOE-ε4 and female sex, on the association between CSF and PET Aβ, in two independent samples of non-demented individuals (ALFA: n = 320, ADNI: n = 682). We tested our hypotheses both in candidate regions of interest and in the whole brain using voxel-wise non-parametric permutations. All of the assessed risk factors induced a higher Aβ deposition for any given level of CSF Aβ42/40, although in distinct cerebral topologies. While age and sex mapped onto neocortical areas, the effect of APOE-ε4 was prominent in the medial temporal lobe, which represents a target of early tau deposition. Further, we found that the effects of age and APOE-ε4 was stronger in women than in men. Our data indicate that specific AD risk factors affect the spatial patterns of cerebral Aβ aggregation, with APOE-ε4 possibly facilitating a co-localization between Aβ and tau along the disease

32485739",Trajectories of Frailty With Aging: Coordinated Analysis of Five Longitudinal Studies.,"There is an urgent need to better understand frailty and its predisposing factors. Although numerous cross-sectional studies have identified various risk and protective factors of frailty, there is a limited understanding of longitudinal frailty progression. Furthermore, discrepancies in the methodologies of these studies hamper comparability of results. Here, we use a coordinated analytical approach in 5 independent cohorts to evaluate longitudinal trajectories of frailty and the effect of 3 previously identified critical risk factors: sex, age, and education.
We derived a frailty index (FI) for 5 cohorts based on the accumulation of deficits approach. Four linear and quadratic growth curve models were fit in each cohort independently. Models were adjusted for sex/gender, age, years of education, and a sex/gender-by-age interaction term.
Models describing linear progression of frailty best fit the data. Annual increases in FI ranged from 0.002 in the Invecchiare in Chianti cohort to 0.009 in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Women had consistently higher levels of frailty than men in all cohorts, ranging from an increase in the mean FI in women from 0.014 in the Health and Retirement Study cohort to 0.046 in the LASA cohort.

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 4014 consecutive adults hospitalized for COVID-19 in a tertiary-level institution from March 2020 to March 2021.
The median age was 74 years. A total of 2256 (56.2%) patients were men. The median Charlson-comorbidity-index (CCI) was 4 points; 3359 (82.7%) patients had severe or critical COVID-19. A significant interaction between age, sex, and survival (P<0.05) persisted after adjustment for CCI. In patients <57 years, male sex was related to a favorable (odds ration [OR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.86), whereas in patients ≥57 years it was related to an unfavorable prognosis (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.37). Comorbidities associated with inferior survival independently of age, sex, and severe/critical COVID-19 on admission were chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, acute cerebrovascular insult, history of venous thromboembolism, chronic kidney disease, major bleeding, liver cirrhosis, mental retardation, dementia, active malignant disease, metastatic malignant disease, autoimmune/rheumatic disease, bilateral pneumonia, and other infections on admission.
Among younger patients, female sex might lead to an adverse prognosis due to undisclosed reasons (differences in fat tissue distribution, hormonal status, and other mechanisms).

32822620",Population attributable fraction of modifiable risk factors for dementia in Chile.,"Projected dementia incidence in Latin America and the Caribbean for the next decades is overwhelming. Access to local data, stratified by sex, is imperative for planning precise dementia-prevention strategies.
We analyzed the individual and overall weighted population attributable fraction (PAF) of nine modifiable risk factors for dementia, in dementia-free subjects ≥45-years-old, using the 2016-2017 Chilean National Health Survey.
The overall weighted PAF for modifiable risk factors was 45.8% (42.2% to 49.3%). Variables with the highest PAF were lower education, high blood pressure, hearing loss, and obesity. Women showed a greater overall weighted PAF: 50.7% (45.3% to -56.1%), compared to men: 40.2% (35.4% to 45.0%), driven by a higher PAF for physical inactivity and depression in women.
The PAF for modifiable risk factors for dementia in Chile is higher than in previous world reports, due to a greater prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Women have a higher potential for dementia prevention.
The proportion of dementia associated to modifiable risk factors in Chile is 45.8%.The main modifiable risk factors are high blood pressure, obesity, and hearing loss.Women had a greater prevalence of physical inactivity and depression than men.Chile had a greater prevalence of metabolic risk factors than other world regions.","['Latin America and the Caribbean', 'cardiovascular', 'dementia', 'depression', 'hypertension', 'midlife', 'modifiable risk factors', 'obesity', 'physical inactivity', 'population attributable fraction', 'prevention']","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2022-03-02,"[{'lastname': 'Vergara', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Kinesiología Facultad de Artes y Educación Física Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación Santiago Chile.'}, {'lastname': 'Zitko', 'firstname': 'Pedro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Health Service & Population Research Department IoPPN King's College London London UK.\nDepartamento de Salud Global Escuela de Salud Pública Universidad de Chile Santiago Chile.""}, {'lastname': 'Slachevsky', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centro de Gerociencia Salud Mental y Metabolismo (GERO) Santiago Chile.\nLaboratorio de Neuropsicología y Neurociencia Clínica (LANNEC) Departamento de Fisiopatología - Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas (ICBM) Departamento de Neurociencias Oriente Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Chile Santiago Chile.\nClínica de Memoria y Neuropsiquiatría (CMYN) Departamento de Neurología Hospital del Salvador y Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Chile Santiago Chile.\nServicio de Neurología Departamento de Medicina Clínica Alemana-Universidad del Desarrollo Santiago Chile.\nDepartamento de Neurociencia Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Chile Santiago Chile.'}, {'lastname': 'San Martin', 'firstname': 'Consuelo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Neurociencia Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Chile Santiago Chile.\nUnidad de Cerebro Saludable Departamento de Neurología y Neurocirugía Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile Independencia Santiago Chile.'}, {'lastname': 'Delgado', 'firstname': 'Carolina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Neurociencia Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Chile Santiago Chile.\nUnidad de Cerebro Saludable Departamento de Neurología y Neurocirugía Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile Independencia Santiago Chile.'}]",,,"The overall weighted PAF for modifiable risk factors was 45.8% (42.2% to 49.3%).

21711252",Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and Midlife Cognitive Function: Impact of Race and Social Disparities in the Bogalusa Heart Study.,"Carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) is a measurement of atherosclerosis, a progressive disease that develops as early as childhood and has been linked with cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly. However, the relationship between c-IMT and midlife cognitive function and the race and social disparities in this relationship remain unclear. We examined the association between c-IMT and cognitive function in midlife among Black and White participants from a semirural community-based cohort in Bogalusa, Louisiana.
In this cross-sectional analysis of participants from the Bogalusa Heart Study, linear regression models were used to determine the association between c-IMT dichotomized above the 50th percentile (>0.87 mm), an a demographically standardized global cognitive score (GCS), and individual cognitive domain-based 
A total of 1,217 participants (age 48 ± 5.28 years) were included; 66% (804) self-identified as White, and 34% (413) self-identified as Black. Of those, 58% (708) were women, and 42% (509) were men. Having a c-IMT ≥50th percentile was inversely associated with GCS (
Subclinical atherosclerosis, measured as c-IMT, was associated with worse midlife cognitive function, independently of major CVRFs. The association was buffered by education and may be stronger among Black than White participants, likely due to corresponding structural and social determinants. These findings underscore the importance of establishing preventive measures in midlife and suggest subclinical atherosclerosis as a potential target to prevent cognitive decline.",[],Neurology,2022-03-02,"[{'lastname': 'De Anda-Duran', 'firstname': 'Ileana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""From the Department of Epidemiology (I.D.A.-D., L.A.B.), Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine;

267,35219735,The association between adverse childhood events and later-life cognitive function and dementia risk.,"Considerable work exists in the literature to describe the negative impacts of early-life stress exposures on health in adulthood. This study investigated whether the accumulation of adverse childhood events is associated with later-life cognitive function and incident dementia.
Participants were 1562 community-dwelling older adults, who were enrolled in the ESPRIT cohort in France. Adverse childhood events were measured using a modified version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Cognition was measured using tests of global cognition, visual memory, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed and executive function. Fourteen-year incident dementia was diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria.
In comparison to participants with two or less adverse childhood events, increased risk of poor psychomotor speed at baseline was observed in individuals with multiple adverse childhood events (3-4 events OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.00-1.93); ≥5 events (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.07-2.17), particularly in women but not in men. Worse verbal fluency was also observed in individuals who experienced between three and four adverse childhood events (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.00-1.78). Amongst the individual factors investigated, early-life abuse/maltreatment (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.02-2.14) and poverty/financial difficulties (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.12-2.08) was associated with worse psychomotor speed. No associations were observed with incident dementia.
Participants most at risk (those with baseline dementia) were excluded.
Multiple adverse childhood events are associated with worse psychomotor speed, and verbal fluency in later-life, however further research is needed to determine the mechanisms underlying this association and whether it results from unmeasured confounding, including social disadvantage.","['Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Stress']",Journal of affective disorders,2022-02-28,"[{'lastname': 'Nilaweera', 'firstname': 'Dinuli', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Freak-Poli', 'firstname': 'Rosanne', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gurvich', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ritchie', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaudieu', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ancelin', 'firstname': 'Marie-Laure', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.

30591381","Associations of dairy, meat, and fish intakes with risk of incident dementia and with cognitive performance: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD).","To investigate if dairy, meat, and fish intakes associate with dementia and cognitive performance.
We included 2497 dementia-free men from Eastern Finland, aged 42-60 years in 1984-1989 at the baseline examinations. Data on cognitive tests [Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), trail making test (TMT), verbal fluency test (VFL), selective reminding test (SRT), and Russell's adaptation of the visual reproduction test (VRT)] at the 4-year re-examinations were available for 482 men and on the ApoE phenotype for 1259 men. Data on dementia events were obtained by linkage to national health registers. Diet was assessed with baseline 4-day food records. Cox regression and analysis of covariance were used for analyses.
During a mean 22-year follow-up, 337 men had a dementia diagnosis. Among the foods, only cheese intake associated with dementia risk (hazard ratio in the highest vs. the lowest quartile = 0.72, 95% confidence interval = 0.52-0.99, P-trend = 0.05). In the cognitive tests, higher non-fermented dairy and milk intakes associated with worse verbal fluency (VFT). Higher processed red meat intake associated with worse verbal (SRT) and visual memory (VRT), whereas higher unprocessed red meat intake associated with better general cognitive functioning (MMSE) and processing speed and executive functioning (TMT). Higher fish intake associated with better verbal memory (SRT). Among APOE-ε4 carriers, especially non-fermented dairy intake associated with higher risk of dementia outcomes, and higher fish intake indicated better cognitive performance.
Although higher intake of some food groups associated with cognitive performance, we found little evidence for associations with dementia risk.","['Apolipoprotein E4', 'Cognitive performance', 'Dairy', 'Dementia', 'Fish', 'Meat']",European journal of nutrition,2022-02-27,"[{'lastname': 'Ylilauri', 'firstname': 'Maija P T', 'initials': 'MPT', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland, P.O.

269,35176530,Types of Elder Abuse and Dementia Onset among Older Adults in Japan: A 6-year Longitudinal Study from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study.,"Elder abuse is a growing global public health concern. Previous studies have reported that elder abuse increases the risk of dementia; however, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the association between different types of abuse and dementia onset yet. This study, therefore, investigated the association between physical, psychological, and financial abuses and dementia onset in independent older adults in Japan.
A 6-year prospective cohort data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) were collected in 2010 through a mail survey conducted among 5,674 men and 6,562 women aged ≥65 years across Japan. Dementia was assessed using the nationally standardized dementia scale proposed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Poisson regression analysis was performed separately for each type of abuse to calculate the incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
During follow-up, 552 (9.7%) men and 728 (11.1%) women developed dementia. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants who experienced financial abuse were 1.53 (1.09-2.16) times more likely to develop dementia than those who did not. On the other hand, participants who experienced physical abuse were 1.53 (0.92-2.56) times more likely and those who experienced psychological abuse were 0.98 (0.82-1.17) times less likely to develop dementia than participants who did not experience such abuses. However, the difference was not significant.
Financial abuse may promote dementia among older adults in Japan, suggesting that preventing this abuse may help prevent dementia onset. However, further studies with larger data sets are warranted.","['cognitive decline', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment', 'elder mistreatment', 'violence']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2022-02-18,"[{'lastname': 'Koga', 'firstname': 'Chie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.

11874812",Risk Factors in Acute Stroke Patients With and Without Sleep Apnea.,"More than 50% of stroke patients have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), mostly in the form of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). SDB represents both a risk factor and a consequence of stroke. The presence of SDB has been linked with the poorer long-term outcome and increased long-term stroke mortality. About 20 to 40% of stroke patients have sleep-wake disorders (SWD), mostly in form of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness/fatigue, or hypersomnia (increased sleep needs).
The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of risk factors in patients with acute stroke and sleep apnea.
The study included patients without cognitive impairment or with mild cognitive impairment. The diagnosis of apnea syndrome was made on the basis of the Snoring and Apnea Syndrome Questionnaire, the Epworth Sleep Scale, the Berlin Questionnaire, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and the General Sleep Questionnaire. The severity of stroke was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the Rankin Disability Scale. Patients with a Glasgow score <8 on the day of neuropsychiatric examination were excluded from the study, as well as patients with epileptic seizures at the onset of stroke, with aphasia, with Mini - mental test <23, with verified previous dementia / cognitive impairment.
There is no statistically significant difference in the age of men and women, both with apnea and without apnea. In patients with apnea, heart disease was in the first place 91.8%, followed by hypertension 86.4%, Body mass index 79.1%, hyperlipidemia 50%, smoking 38.2 % and diabetes mellitus 20.9%. Hypertension was the most common risk factor in patients without apnea 83.6%, followed by heart disease 81.0%, Body mass index 60.9%, hyperlipidemia 48.21%, smoking 28.2 % and diabetes mellitus 20%.
Heart diseases, hypertension and body mass index are significantly more frequent in patients with than in patients without sleep apnea.","['Risk Factors', 'Sleep apnea', 'Stroke']","Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)",2022-02-17,"[{'lastname': 'Kojic', 'firstname': 'Biljana', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.'}, {'lastname': 'Dostovic', 'firstname': 'Zikrija', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibrahimagic', 'firstname': 'Omer C', 'initials': 'OC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.'}, {'lastname': 'Smajlovic', 'firstname': 'Dzevdet', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.'}, {'lastname': 'Hodzic', 'firstname': 'Renata', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.'}, {'lastname': 'Iljazovic', 'firstname': 'Amra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.'}, {'lastname': 'Salihovic', 'firstname': 'Denisa', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.'}]",,"Heart diseases, hypertension and body mass index are significantly more frequent in patients with than in patients without sleep apnea.","There is no statistically significant difference in the age of men and women, both with apnea and without apnea.

28888267","The Diabetes-Cardiovascular Connection in Women: Understanding the Known Risks, Outcomes, and Implications for Care.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications constitute about 50-70% of mortality in people with diabetes. However, there remains a persistently greater relative increase in CVD morbidity and mortality in women with diabetes than in their male counterparts. This review presents recent evidence for the risks, outcomes, and management implications for women with diabetes.
Compared to men, women have higher BMI and more adverse cardiovascular risk profile at time of diabetes diagnosis with greater risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, vascular dementia, and heart failure. Pregnancy-specific risk factors of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia are associated with future type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD. Women with T2D may experience greater benefits than men from GLP-1 receptor agonists. Women with diabetes are at greater relative risk for CVD complications than men, with poorer outcomes, superimposed on preexisting gender disparities in social determinants of health, lower likelihood of being offered cardioprotective interventions, and enrollment in trials. Further research and the utilization of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and other CVD prevention strategies will help reduce morbidity and mortality.","['Cardiovascular diseases', 'Diabetes', 'Gestational diabetes', 'Menopause', 'Obesity', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome']",Current diabetes reports,2022-02-15,"[{'lastname': 'Broni', 'firstname': 'Eric K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ndumele', 'firstname': 'Chiadi E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Echouffo-Tcheugui', 'firstname': 'Justin B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalyani', 'firstname': 'Rita R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bennett', 'firstname': 'Wendy L', 'initials': 'WL', 'affiliation': 'Division of General Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Michos', 'firstname': 'Erin D', 'initials': 'ED', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. edonnell@jhmi.edu.\nCiccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Blalock 524-B, 600 N.

Documented evidence of post COVID syndrome among patients with asymptomatic or mild infections, especially from India is less.
A community based prospective cohort study was conducted among 154 patients admitted in CFLTCs of coastal Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala during May-August 2020. They were enrolled at the time of their admission to CFLTCs and were followed up for three months after discharge. The discharged patients were followed up at regular intervals of three weeks and three months by telephonic interview using a structured proforma.
Out of the 154 patients followed up, 57 (37%) were men and 97 (63%) were women. The mean (SD) age of study participants was 31.49 (18.4) years. At least one symptom was present in 120 (78.0%) patients at the time of admission. Cough (29, 18.8%), fever (26, 16.8%), headache (25, 16.2%), rhinitis (23,14.9%) and sore throat (18, 11.7%) were the major symptoms reported at the time of admission. At the end of three weeks, 11 (7.1%) patients and at the end of three months 18 (11.7%) patients reported to have symptoms. Fatigue (5.8%), headache (5.8%) myalgia (3.2%) joint pain (2.5%) and exertional dyspnea (2.5%) were the predominant symptoms. Presence of fatigue, cough and breathlessness at the time of admission, and presence of another COVID positive family member were significantly associated with the appearance of post COVID symptoms.

274,35103619,[Hypertension Management in Primary Care in the Capital Area of Iceland].,"High blood pressure (HT) is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases which in 2010 caused one third of all mortality in the world. Untreated, HT can cause stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, dementia, kidney failure, atherosclerosis and eye diseases. The main aim of this study was to find out how HT is treated in primary care in the capital area of Iceland.
The study is a descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study covering the years 2010, 2014 and 2019. Information about all patients over 18 years old diagnosed with HT were gathered from computerised medical records at every primary care center in the Capital area.
The number of individuals diagnosed with HT increased during the study period and the mean age did also increase. The sex ratio changed with more men diagnosed than women. Of 25.873 patients diagnosed with HT in the year 2010, 63.4% received drug treatment. In 2019 this percentage had dropped 60.9% (p<0,001). Of those on antihypertensive drug treatment the proportion receiving one, two or three drugs remained same from 2010-2019. The most common group of drugs used were diuretics (C03), beta-blockers (C07), calcium channel blockers (C08) and renin-angiotensin-aldosteron-system (RAAS) inhibitors (C09). The proportion af these drug groups changed significantly during the study. Fever patients were treated by diuretics (p<0,001) or beta-blockers ((p<0,001) but the number treated by calcium channel blockers (p<0,01) or RAAS inhibitors increased (p<0,001). During the whole stud period 44.1% of the patients reached the target goals. The proportion of patients who reached the target goals in different health care center was specifically for the year 2019. Just over 41% of HT patients reached the targets goals. However, two health care centers achieved notably different results with only one third of the patients attaining the goals.
As has recently been shown in epidemiologic studies hypertension in Iceland is both underdiagnosed and undertreated although the country ranks high on both counts in international comparison. Furthermore, the fact that under half of hypertensive patients in general practice in the capital area reach the targeted treatment goals, cannot be considered an acceptable. Thus, it is of immense importance to improve both the diagnosis and the treatment of HT.","[' treatment goals', 'drug treatment', 'hypertension', 'primary care']",Laeknabladid,2022-02-02,"[{'lastname': 'Adalsteinsson', 'firstname': 'Stefan Julius', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland School of Health Sciences, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jonsson', 'firstname': 'Jon Steinar', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland School of Health Sciences, Reykjavik, Iceland, Development Centre for Primary Healthcare in Iceland, Primary Health Care of the Capital Area, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hrafnkelsson', 'firstname': 'Hannes', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland School of Health Sciences, Reykjavik, Iceland, The primary health care of the capital area.'}, {'lastname': 'Thorgeirsson', 'firstname': 'Gudmundur', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland School of Health Sciences, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sigurdsson', 'firstname': 'Emil Larus', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland School of Health Sciences, Reykjavik, Iceland, Development Centre for Primary Healthcare in Iceland, Primary Health Care of the Capital Area, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}]",,"As has recently been shown in epidemiologic studies hypertension in Iceland is both underdiagnosed and undertreated although the country ranks high on both counts in international comparison.

31727919",Longitudinal white matter hyperintensity changes and cognitive decline in patients with minor stroke.,"As reported, both minor stroke and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The underlying factors for dynamic changes in WMH volume and cognitive performances in patients with minor stroke remain poorly understood. A 2-year longitudinal study was designed to investigate the factors associated with the changes in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on brain MRI and cognitive decline in patients with minor stroke.
A group of eligible patients with minor ischemic stroke was recruited in a row. At the initial and 2-year follow-up visits, all the participants underwent routine examinations, multimodal MRI, and cognitive assessment. Using a lesion prediction algorithm tool, we were able to automate the measurement of the change in WMH volume. During the 2-year follow-up, cognitive function was evaluated using Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-m). Participants' demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were collected and statistically analyzed. Regression analyses were used to test the relationships between risk factors and changes in WMH volume and cognitive decline.
Finally, we followed up with 225/261 participants for 2 years, with a mean age of 65.67 ± 10.73 years (65.6% men). WMH volume was observed to be increased in 113 patients, decreased in 74 patients, and remained stable in 58 patients. Patients with WMH progression were more often had a history of hypertension (p = 0.006) and a higher CSVD burden both at baseline and follow-up visit (p < 0.05). Longitudinally, the proportion of patients taking antihypertension medications on a regular basis in the regression group was higher than in the stable group (p = 0.01). When compared to the stable group, the presence of lacunes (OR 9.931, 95% CI 1.597-61.77, p = 0.014) was a stronger predictor of progression in WMH volume. 87 subjects (38.6%) displayed incident cognitive impairment. The progression of WMH volume was a significant risk factor for cognitive decline (p < 0.001).
The longitudinal change of WMH is dynamic. The regressive WMH volume was associated with the use of antihypertensive medications on a regular basis. The presence of lacunes at the initial visit of the study was a stronger predictor of WMH progression. The progression of WMH volume could be useful in predicting cognitive decline in patients with minor stroke.","['Cognitive impairment', 'Dynamic change', 'Minor stroke', 'White matter hyperintensities']",Aging clinical and experimental research,2022-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Jingwen', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yao', 'firstname': 'Kanmin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Xiaojun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Fanxia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. sfxb1097@rjhn.com.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Weng', 'firstname': 'Suiqing', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Shanghai Minhang Hospital, Shanghai Fu Dan University, Shanghai, China. 1829053894@qq.com.'}]",,,"Finally, we followed up with 225/261 participants for 2 years, with a mean age of 65.67 ± 10.73 years (65.6% men).

276,35066008,"Depression in adulthood and risk of dementia later in life: A Danish register-based cohort study of 595,828 men.","Associations between depression and dementia could express a causal relationship, reverse causality or be explained by health-related factors. This study explores the association of depression and indicators of depression severity with subsequent risk of dementia while ensuring temporality and adjusting for important health-related factors.
595,828 men from the Danish Conscription Database born in 1939-59 with register-based information on lifetime depression and covariates at age 55 years were followed in nationwide registers to identify dementia cases until 2016. Associations were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression models with adjustment for intelligence, education level, body mass index, and comorbidities.
The dementia incidence per 1000 person-years was 1.2 cases for men without prior depression and 2.1 and 3.6 cases for men who had depression identified by antidepressants and hospitalization, respectively. Compared to no prior depression, depression identified by antidepressant medication was associated with 1.94 times [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.81;2.07] higher hazard of dementia and depression identified by hospitalization with depression was associated with 2.18 [95% CI: 1.95;2.45] higher hazard of dementia. Long-term course of depression identified by antidepressant prescriptions (>20 prescriptions), was associated with 40% 95% CI: 1.23;1.59 higher hazard of dementia compared to having ≤10 prescriptions.
This study is restricted to men and dementia cases until age 57-77 years.
Men with depression before late midlife are subject to a higher risk of dementia later in life.

To assess whether a history of clinical depression is associated with dementia in later life, controlling for observed sociodemographic factors and unobserved factors shared by siblings, and to test whether gender, educational level and marital status modify the association.
We conducted a national cohort study of 1 616 321 individuals aged 65 years or older between 2001 and 2018 using administrative healthcare data. A history of depression was ascertained from the national hospital register in the period 15-30 years prior to dementia follow-up.

30355032",Association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with risk of dementia among individuals with type 2 diabetes: A cohort study in the UK Biobank.,"Several epidemiological studies have suggested that vitamin D status is associated with risk of dementia in general populations. However, due to the synergistic effect between diabetic pathology and neuroinflammation, and the prothrombotic profile in patients with diabetes, whether vitamin D is associated with risk of dementia among patients with diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations of circulating vitamin D levels with risks of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
This study included 13,486 individuals (≥60 years) with T2D and free of dementia at recruitment (2006-2010) from the UK Biobank study. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations were measured using the chemiluminescent immunoassay method at recruitment. Serum 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L was considered sufficient, according to the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines. Incidence of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD cases was ascertained using electronic health records (EHRs). Each participant's person-years at risk were calculated from the date of recruitment to the date that dementia was reported, date of death, date of loss to follow-up, or 28 February 2018, whichever occurred first. Among the 13,486 individuals with T2D (mean age, 64.6 years; men, 64.3%), 38.3% had vitamin D ≥ 50 nmol/L and only 9.1% had vitamin D ≥ 75 nmol/L. During a mean follow-up of 8.5 years, we observed 283 cases of all-cause dementia, including 101 AD and 97 VD cases. Restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between serum 25(OH)D and risk of all-cause dementia (Pnonlinearity < 0.001) and VD (Pnonlinearity = 0.007), and the nonlinear association reached borderline significance for AD (Pnonlinearity = 0.06), with a threshold at around a serum 25(OH)D value of 50 nmol/L for all the outcomes. Higher serum levels of 25(OH)D were significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD. The multivariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for participants who had serum 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L, compared with those who were severely deficient (25[OH]D < 25 nmol/L), were 0.41 (0.29-0.60) for all-cause dementia (Ptrend < 0.001), 0.50 (0.27-0.92) for AD (Ptrend = 0.06), and 0.41 (0.22-0.77) for VD (Ptrend = 0.01). The main limitation of the current analysis was the potential underreporting of dementia cases, as the cases were identified via EHRs.
In this study, we observed that higher concentrations of serum 25(OH)D were significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD among individuals with T2D. Our findings, if confirmed by replication, may have relevance for dementia prevention strategies that target improving or maintaining serum vitamin D concentrations among patients with T2D.",[],PLoS medicine,2022-01-14,"[{'lastname': 'Geng', 'firstname': 'Tingting', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Qi', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wan', 'firstname': 'Zhenzhen', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Jingyu', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Liegang', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Pan', 'firstname': 'An', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Gang', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pmed.1003906

280,35022812,Guideline adherence by physicians for management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in Japan: a nationwide health insurance claims database study.,"Risk of fracture due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) can be reduced by anti-osteoporosis (OP) medications. The proportion of patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy who received anti-OP medications according to the GIO management guidelines has increased in recent years, but is still suboptimal.
Adherence of physicians to guidelines for glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis (GIO) management is currently unclear. This study aimed to clarify the state of guideline adherence by physicians in Japan and identify factors associated with guideline adherence using a nationwide health insurance claims database (NDBJ).
Patients aged ≥ 50 years who were prescribed GC for ≥ 90 days after 180 days without a GC prescription and who were followed up for osteoporosis (OP) management for the subsequent 360 days during the period spanning 2012-2018 were selected from the NDBJ. Guideline adherence was evaluated with the proportion of patients who received OP management as recommended by the Japanese guidelines. Information on previous vertebral and hip fractures, dementia, and polypharmacy was obtained. Factors associated with OP management were evaluated by logistic regression analysis.
A total of 512,296 patients were considered to be at high risk of fracture according to the guidelines. Proportions of patients receiving OP management (BMD testing or anti-OP medications) have increased in recent years. In 2017, 33.7% of men and 55.3% of women received OP management in the initial 90 days of GC therapy. Female sex, previous anti-OP medications, polypharmacy, and higher GC dose were significantly associated with receiving OP management, while dementia showed an inverse association. A prior history of hip fracture, a strong risk factor for future fracture, was not significantly associated with receiving OP management.
Although guideline adherence by physicians has increased in recent years, it remains suboptimal. Further efforts to improve guideline adherence are necessary.

32561386",Impact of Testosterone on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease responsible for almost half of all dementia cases in the world and progressively increasing. The etiopathology includes heritability, genetic factors, aging, nutrition, but sex hormones play a relevant role. Animal models demonstrated that testosterone (T) exerted a neuroprotective effect reducing the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ), improving synaptic signaling, and counteracting neuronal death. This study aims to evaluate the impact of T deprivation and T administration in humans on the onset of dementia and AD. A search was conducted on MEDLINE and Scopus for the ""androgen deprivation therapy"" and ""testosterone therapy"" with ""dementia"" and ""Alzheimer's."" Studies lasting twenty years with low risk of bias, randomized clinical trial, and case-controlled studies were considered. Twelve articles on the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and AD and seventeen on T therapy and AD were retrieved. Men with prostate cancer under ADT showed a higher incidence of dementia and AD. The effect of T administration in hypogonadal men with AD and cognitive impairment has evidenced some positive results. The majority of studies showed the T administration improved memory and cognition in AD while others did not find any benefit. Although some biases in the studies are evident, T therapy for AD patients may represent an essential clinical therapy to reduce dementia incidence and AD progression. However, more specific case-controlled trials on the effect of androgens therapy in men and women to reducing the onset of AD are necessary.","['Alzheimer disease', 'Amyloid beta-peptides', 'Dementia', 'Estradiol', 'Neuroprotection', 'Testosterone']",The world journal of men's health,2022-01-13,"[{'lastname': 'Bianchi', 'firstname': 'Vittorio Emanuele', 'initials': 'VE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Clinical Research Center Stella Maris, Falciano, San Marino, Italy. dott.vbianchi@gmail.com.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2022 Korean Society for Sexual Medicine and Andrology.,10.5534/wjmh.210175,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de4d2e50>,,,,,,
282,35015886,"Severe Hypoglycemia Increases Dementia Risk and Related Mortality: A Nationwide, Population-based Cohort Study.","There are few studies focused on the relationship between hypoglycemia and new-onset dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes and no study regarding mortality of dementia after hypoglycemia.
We investigated the effect of severe hypoglycemia on dementia subtypes and its relation to overall mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.
We evaluated incident dementia, including Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, among health checkup participants aged 40 years or older in the National Health Insurance System in Korea from January 2009 to December 2015. Episodes of severe hypoglycemia were examined for 3 years before the date of the health checkup.
Among 2 032 689 participants (1 172 271 men, 860 418 women), 14 443 (0.7%) experienced severe hypoglycemia, during a mean follow-up period of 6.9 ± 1.7 years. Individuals in the severe hypoglycemia group were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia compared to individuals without severe hypoglycemia (23.3% vs 7.3%; P < .001) and the overall incidence of Alzheimer disease was higher than vascular dementia. Dementia risk rose with increasing number of severe hypoglycemic episodes (1 episode [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.48-1.60], 2 or more episodes [HR = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.66-1.94]). Overall mortality was higher in participants with dementia, but without severe hypoglycemia (HR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.96-2.10) and severe hypoglycemia, but without dementia (HR = 4.24; 95% CI, 4.29-4.40), and risk of death was highest in those with both severe hypoglycemia and dementia (HR = 5.08; 95% CI, 4.83-5.35).
Severe hypoglycemia is associated with dementia, especially Alzheimer disease and mortality; together, they have an additive effect on overall mortality.","['dementia', 'diabetes', 'hypoglycemia', 'mortality']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2022-01-12,"[{'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Eugene', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Kyung-do', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Soongsil University, Seoul 06978, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Byung-Wan', 'initials': 'BW', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Endocrine Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Eun Seok', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Endocrine Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Cha', 'firstname': 'Bong-Soo', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Endocrine Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ko', 'firstname': 'Seung-Hyun', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University, Seoul 16247, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Yong-Ho', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Endocrine Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.\nDivision of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.\nDepartment of Systems Biology, Glycosylation Network Research Center, Yonsei University, Seoul 03772, Republic of Korea.'}]",,"Severe hypoglycemia is associated with dementia, especially Alzheimer disease and mortality; together, they have an additive effect on overall mortality.","Among 2 032 689 participants (1 172 271 men, 860 418 women), 14 443 (0.7%) experienced severe hypoglycemia, during a mean follow-up period of 6.9 ± 1.7 years.

29528368",Handgrip strength and risk of cognitive outcomes: new prospective study and meta-analysis of 16 observational cohort studies.,"Handgrip strength (HGS), a measure of muscular strength, might be a risk indicator for cognitive functioning, but the evidence is not consistent. Using a new prospective study and meta-analysis of published observational cohort studies, we aimed to evaluate the prospective associations of HGS with poor cognitive outcomes including cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Handgrip strength, measured using a Martin-Balloon-Vigorimeter, was assessed at baseline in a population-based sample of 852 men and women with good cognitive function in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease cohort. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for cognitive outcomes. Relevant published studies were sought in MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science from inception until October 2021 and pooled using random effects meta-analysis. During a median follow-up of 16.6 years, 229 dementia cases were recorded. Comparing extreme tertiles of HGS, the multivariable adjusted HR (95% CI) for dementia, AD and vascular dementia was 0.77 (0.55-1.07), 0.75 (0.52-1.10) and 0.49 (0.16-1.48), respectively. In a meta-analysis of 16 population-based prospective cohort studies (including the current study) comprising 180,920 participants, the pooled multivariable adjusted relative risks (95% CIs) comparing the top vs bottom thirds of HGS levels were as follows: 0.58 (0.52-0.65) for cognitive impairment; 0.37 (0.07-1.85) for cognitive decline; 0.73 (0.62-0.86) for dementia; 0.68 (0.53-0.87) for AD; and 0.48 (0.32-0.73) for vascular dementia. GRADE quality of evidence ranged from low to very low. Meta-analysis of aggregate prospective data suggests that HGS may be a risk indicator for poor cognitive outcomes such as cognitive impairment, dementia and AD.

18849605",Estimation of the global prevalence of dementia in 2019 and forecasted prevalence in 2050: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.,"Given the projected trends in population ageing and population growth, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase. In addition, strong evidence has emerged supporting the importance of potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Characterising the distribution and magnitude of anticipated growth is crucial for public health planning and resource prioritisation. This study aimed to improve on previous forecasts of dementia prevalence by producing country-level estimates and incorporating information on selected risk factors.
We forecasted the prevalence of dementia attributable to the three dementia risk factors included in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 (high body-mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, and smoking) from 2019 to 2050, using relative risks and forecasted risk factor prevalence to predict GBD risk-attributable prevalence in 2050 globally and by world region and country. Using linear regression models with education included as an additional predictor, we then forecasted the prevalence of dementia not attributable to GBD risks. To assess the relative contribution of future trends in GBD risk factors, education, population growth, and population ageing, we did a decomposition analysis.
We estimated that the number of people with dementia would increase from 57·4 (95% uncertainty interval 50·4-65·1) million cases globally in 2019 to 152·8 (130·8-175·9) million cases in 2050. Despite large increases in the projected number of people living with dementia, age-standardised both-sex prevalence remained stable between 2019 and 2050 (global percentage change of 0·1% [-7·5 to 10·8]). We estimated that there were more women with dementia than men with dementia globally in 2019 (female-to-male ratio of 1·69 [1·64-1·73]), and we expect this pattern to continue to 2050 (female-to-male ratio of 1·67 [1·52-1·85]). There was geographical heterogeneity in the projected increases across countries and regions, with the smallest percentage changes in the number of projected dementia cases in high-income Asia Pacific (53% [41-67]) and western Europe (74% [58-90]), and the largest in north Africa and the Middle East (367% [329-403]) and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (357% [323-395]). Projected increases in cases could largely be attributed to population growth and population ageing, although their relative importance varied by world region, with population growth contributing most to the increases in sub-Saharan Africa and population ageing contributing most to the increases in east Asia.
Growth in the number of individuals living with dementia underscores the need for public health planning efforts and policy to address the needs of this group. Country-level estimates can be used to inform national planning efforts and decisions. Multifaceted approaches, including scaling up interventions to address modifiable risk factors and investing in research on biological mechanisms, will be key in addressing the expected increases in the number of individuals affected by dementia.

285,34997937,Dairy Intake and Parkinson's Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Previous prospective studies highlighted dairy intake as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in men. It is unclear whether this association is causal or explained by reverse causation or confounding.
The aim is to examine the association between genetically predicted dairy intake and PD using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).
We genotyped a well-established instrumental variable for dairy intake located in the lactase gene (rs4988235) within the Courage-PD consortium (23 studies; 9823 patients and 8376 controls of European ancestry).
Based on a dominant model, there was an association between genetic predisposition toward higher dairy intake and PD (odds ratio [OR] per one serving per day = 1.70, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-2.60, P = 0.013) that was restricted to men (OR = 2.50 [1.37-4.56], P = 0.003; P-difference with women = 0.029).
Using MR, our findings provide further support for a causal relationship between dairy intake and higher PD risk, not biased by confounding or reverse causation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","[""dairy intake; Parkinson's disease; Mendelian randomization""]",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2022-01-09,"[{'lastname': 'Domenighetti', 'firstname': 'Cloé', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'UVSQ, Univ.

24355614","Contribution of socioeconomic, lifestyle, and medical risk factors to disparities in dementia and mortality.","Extensive literature in the United States documents racial/ethnic and gender disparities in the incidence and prevalence of dementia yet few studies have examined how race/ethnicity and gender intersect to shape inequalities in the risk of dementia. Moreover, few studies have examined heterogeneity in the contribution of known risk factors to dementia across these demographic strata while properly accounting for the semi-competing risk of death. I calculated the proportion of dementia cases attributable to socioeconomic, lifestyle, and medical risk factors across demographic subgroups using nationally representative data from the US-based Health and Retirement Study for the years 2000-2016 and a multistate framework that accounts for the semi-competing risk of death. Socioeconomic resources contributed to the largest number of dementia cases but the magnitude of this contribution varied across strata defined by race/ethnicity and gender. The greatest potential for dementia prevention was observed among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic men and women, supporting an intersectionality approach, and underscoring the need for culturally sensitive intervention and public health initiatives to address the growing burden of dementia. Taken together, work demonstrates the potential benefit of taking an intersectional approach to understanding disparities in dementia.","['Dementia', 'Intersectionality', 'Mortality', 'Multistate', 'Population attributable fraction']",SSM - population health,2022-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Weiss', 'firstname': 'Jordan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'University of California, 2232 Piedmont Avenue, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.'}]",,,,© 2021 The Author.,"10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100979

21684021","Homocysteine, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin, and Frailty in Older People: Findings From the ""Invece. Ab"" Study.","Frailty is an important age-related syndrome associated with several adverse health outcomes. Its biological basis is undefined. Raised plasma homocysteine (HOcy) is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, dementia, cognitive impairment, and mortality, but little is known about the possible role of plasma HOcy, cyanocobalamin (B12), and folate (FO levels in the development of frailty. Our first aim was to explore the possible association between frailty and plasma concentrations of HOcy, FO, and B12 in a cohort of community-dwelling older people. The second was to assess the influence of these metabolic factors on six-year incidence of frailty in the 875 individuals eligible for inclusion in this study (those with a full follow-up dataset). This research is based on data from three waves - 2012 (herein taken as baseline), 2014, and 2018 - of a longitudinal study (InveCe.Ab) in which non-frail men and women born between 1935 and 1939 underwent multidimensional assessments. Frailty was estimated using a deficit accumulation-based frailty index (FI). HOcy concentration was significantly positively correlated with FI at all timepoints, while B12 and FO levels were not. Plasma concentration of HOcy emerged as a predictor of six-year cumulative incidence of frailty, independent of age, sex, and education, while B12 and FO levels showed no relationship with frailty incidence. Individuals with plasma HOcy in the top quintile showed five months less frailty-free survival (HR 1.487; 95% CI: 1.063-2.078), regardless of age, sex, and education. These results demonstrate that higher HOcy is a risk factor for frailty onset in older adults.","['cyanocobalamin', 'folic acid', 'frailty', 'homocysteine', 'longitudinal study', 'older people']",Frontiers in physiology,2022-01-04,"[{'lastname': 'Guaita', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiological and Neuropathological Laboratories, Golgi Cenci Foundation, Abbiategrasso, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Brunelli', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Davin', 'firstname': 'Annalisa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiological and Neuropathological Laboratories, Golgi Cenci Foundation, Abbiategrasso, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Poloni', 'firstname': 'Tino Emanuele', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiological and Neuropathological Laboratories, Golgi Cenci Foundation, Abbiategrasso, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaccaro', 'firstname': 'Roberta', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiological and Neuropathological Laboratories, Golgi Cenci Foundation, Abbiategrasso, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gagliardi', 'firstname': 'Stella', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Genomic and Post-Genomic Unit, IRCCS Mondino Foundation, Pavia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pansarasa', 'firstname': 'Orietta', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Genomic and Post-Genomic Unit, IRCCS Mondino Foundation, Pavia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cereda', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Woman, Mother and Newborn, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, ""V.

It is unclear if other patient factors and race interactions may influence mortality in patients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate how multiple determinants of all-cause in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 were linked to race.
A retrospective observational study was conducted at two hospitals in metropolitan Detroit. We identified patients aged ≥18 years-old who had tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted between March 9 through May 16, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was performed assessing predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality in COVID-19.
We identified 1064 unique patients; 74% were African Americans (AA). The all-cause in-hospital mortality was 21.7%, with the majority of deaths seen in AA (65.4%, 
Gender significantly modified the association of race and COVID-19 mortality.

33198490",Exploration of Cognitive Outcomes and Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline Shared by Couples.,"Although couples could share many risk factors of cognitive disorders in their lifetime, whether shared risk factors mediate the shared risk of cognitive disorders has rarely been investigated.
To identify the risk factors of cognitive decline shared within couples and investigate their mediating roles in the shared risk of cognitive disorders and cognitive functions within couples.
A prospective cohort study was launched in November 1, 2010, and 784 participants were followed up every 2 years until December 31, 2020. This nationwide, multicenter, community-based study included older couples from the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia (KLOSCAD) and a cohort of their spouses (KLOSCAD-S).
The cognitive disorder of a spouse was defined as mild cognitive impairment or dementia.
The mediating roles of factors shared within couples on the association between one spouse's cognitive disorder and the other's risk of cognitive disorders was examined with structural equation modeling.
Included were 784 KLOSCAD participants (307 women [39.2%] and 477 men [60.8%]; mean [SD] age, 74.8 [4.8] years) and their spouses (477 women [60.8%] and 307 men [39.2%]; mean [SD] age, 73.6 [6.2] years). The cognitive disorder of the KLOSCAD participants was associated with almost double the risk of cognitive disorder of their spouses in the KLOSCAD-S cohort (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.12-2.69; P = .01). History of head injury (β = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.09-0.90; P = .02) and age (β = 2.57; 95% CI, 1.37-3.76; P < .001) mediated the association between cognitive disorder in the KLOSCAD participants and their spouses' risk of cognitive disorder. Physical inactivity mediated the association through major depressive disorder (β = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.09-0.57, P = .006 for physical inactivity; β = 0.28, 95% CI, 0.13-0.44, P < .001 for major depressive disorder). These factors similarly mediated the association between spousal cognitive disorder and cognitive functions such as memory and executive function.
These findings suggest that the risk factors shared within couples may mediate approximately three-quarters of the spousal risk of cognitive disorders. Identification of and intervention in the shared risk factors of dementia within couples may reduce the risk of cognitive disorders in the spouses of people with dementia.",[],JAMA network open,2021-12-21,"[{'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Hee Won', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Bae', 'firstname': 'Jong Bin', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Oh', 'firstname': 'Dae Jong', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Moon', 'firstname': 'Dong Gyu', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Eunji', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital, Changwon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Jin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Bong Jo', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Gyeongsang National University, School of Medicine, Jinju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Dong Woo', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jeong Lan', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jhoo', 'firstname': 'Jin Hyeong', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Joon Hyuk', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Jeju National University Hospital, Jeju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jung Jae', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Dankook University Hospital, Cheonan, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwak', 'firstname': 'Kyung Phil', 'initials': 'KP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital, Gyeongju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Seok Bum', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Dankook University Hospital, Cheonan, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Moon', 'firstname': 'Seok Woo', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Konkuk University Chungju Hospital, Chungju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryu', 'firstname': 'Seung-Ho', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Shin Gyeom', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Ji Won', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ki Woong', 'initials': 'KW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.\nDepartment of Brain and Cognitive Science, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, South Korea.'}]",,,"Included were 784 KLOSCAD participants (307 women [39.2%] and 477 men [60.8%]; mean [SD] age, 74.8 [4.8] years) and their spouses (477 women [60.8%] and 307 men [39.2%]; mean [SD] age, 73.6 [6.2] years).

18720183","Novel Functional, Health, and Genetic Determinants of Cognitive Terminal Decline: Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program/Honolulu-Asia Aging Study.","To investigate interindividual differences in cognitive terminal decline and identify determinants including functional, health, and genetic risk and protective factors, data from the Honolulu Heart Program/Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, a prospective cohort study of Japanese American men, were analyzed. The sample was recruited in 1965-1968 (ages 45-68 years). Longitudinal performance of cognitive abilities and mortality status were assessed from Exam 4 (1991-1993) through June 2014. Latent class analysis revealed 2 groups: maintainers retained relatively high levels of cognitive functioning until death and decliners demonstrated significant cognitive waning several years prior to death. Maintainers were more likely to have greater education, diagnosed coronary heart disease, and presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 allele and FOXO3 G allele (SNP rs2802292). Decliners were more likely to be older and have prior stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and greater depressive symptoms at Exam 4, and the APOE ε4 allele. Findings support terminal decline using distance to death as the basis for modeling change. Significant differences were observed between maintainers and decliners 15 years prior to death, a finding much earlier compared to the majority of previous investigations.","['APOE', 'Cognitive decline', 'FOXO3', 'Genetics', 'Resilience']","The journals of gerontology.

19752306",Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Progression to Dementia in Memory Clinic Patients.,"Machine learning algorithms could be used as the basis for clinical decision-making aids to enhance clinical practice.
To assess the ability of machine learning algorithms to predict dementia incidence within 2 years compared with existing models and determine the optimal analytic approach and number of variables required.
This prognostic study used data from a prospective cohort of 15 307 participants without dementia at baseline to perform a secondary analysis of factors that could be used to predict dementia incidence. Participants attended National Alzheimer Coordinating Center memory clinics across the United States between 2005 and 2015. Analyses were conducted from March to May 2021.
258 variables spanning domains of dementia-related clinical measures and risk factors.
The main outcome was incident all-cause dementia diagnosed within 2 years of baseline assessment.
In a sample of 15 307 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.3 [9.8] years; 9129 [60%] women and 6178 [40%] men) without dementia at baseline, 1568 (10%) received a diagnosis of dementia within 2 years of their initial assessment. Compared with 2 existing models for dementia risk prediction (ie, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia Risk Score, and the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator), machine learning algorithms were superior in predicting incident all-cause dementia within 2 years. The gradient-boosted trees algorithm had a mean (SD) overall accuracy of 92% (1%), sensitivity of 0.45 (0.05), specificity of 0.97 (0.01), and area under the curve of 0.92 (0.01) using all 258 variables. Analysis of variable importance showed that only 6 variables were required for machine learning algorithms to achieve an accuracy of 91% and area under the curve of at least 0.89. Machine learning algorithms also identified up to 84% of participants who received an initial dementia diagnosis that was subsequently reversed to mild cognitive impairment or cognitively unimpaired, suggesting possible misdiagnosis.
These findings suggest that machine learning algorithms could accurately predict incident dementia within 2 years in patients receiving care at memory clinics using only 6 variables. These findings could be used to inform the development and validation of decision-making aids in memory clinics.",[],JAMA network open,2021-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'James', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nDeep Dementia Phenotyping Network, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Ranson', 'firstname': 'Janice M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nDeep Dementia Phenotyping Network, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Everson', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Deep Dementia Phenotyping Network, United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nThe Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Llewellyn', 'firstname': 'David J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom.\nDeep Dementia Phenotyping Network, United Kingdom.\nThe Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom.'}]",,,"In a sample of 15 307 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.3 [9.8] years; 9129 [60%] women and 6178 [40%] men) without dementia at baseline, 1568 (10%) received a diagnosis of dementia within 2 years of their initial assessment.

10319781",Plasma Pro-Enkephalin A and Ischemic Stroke Risk: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Cohort.,"The opioid neuropeptide pro-enkephalin A (PENK-A) may be a circulating marker of cardiovascular risk, with prior findings relevant to heart failure, kidney disease, and vascular dementia. Despite these findings, the association of PENK-A with ischemic stroke is unknown, so we examined this association in a prospective cohort study and analyzed differences by race and sex.
The REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS) is a prospective cohort study of 30,239 Black and White adults. Plasma PENK-A was measured in 473 participants that developed first-time ischemic stroke over 5.9 years and 899 randomly selected participants. Cox models adjusted for demographics and stroke risk factors were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke by baseline PENK-A.
PENK-A was higher with increasing age, female sex, White race, lower body mass index, and antihypertensive medication use. Each SD higher increment of PENK-A was associated with an adjusted HR of 1.20 (95% CI 1.01-1.42) for stroke, with minimal confounding by stroke risk factors. Spline plots suggested a U-shaped relationship, particularly in White men, with an adjusted HR 3.88 (95% CI 1.94-7.77) for the 95
Higher baseline plasma PENK-A was independently associated with future stroke risk in REGARDS. This association was most apparent among White men. There was little confounding by established stroke risk factors, suggesting a possible causal role in stroke etiology. Further research is needed to understand the role of endogenous opioids in stroke pathogenesis.","['Cohort', 'Epidemiology', 'Pro-enkephalin', 'REGARDS', 'Risk factors', 'Stroke risk']",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,2021-12-14,"[{'lastname': 'Short', 'firstname': 'Samuel Ap', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilkinson', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT.'}, {'lastname': 'Long', 'firstname': 'D Leann', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.'}, {'lastname': 'Judd', 'firstname': 'Suzanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulte', 'firstname': 'Janin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'SphingoTec GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kissela', 'firstname': 'Brett M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH.'}, {'lastname': 'Howard', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.'}, {'lastname': 'Cushman', 'firstname': 'Mary', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT; Department of Medicine, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT.

295,34877643,[The effect of age and sex on factors associated with dementia].,"There is currently no cure for dementia and its prevention is considered to be crucial. The aim is to analyse the association between risk factors and dementia, and how this varies according to age and sex.
This cross-sectional study includes 1,048,956 people aged 65 and over. Data were obtained from the SIDIAP pseudonymised clinical database. The response variable was dementia and cases were identified using a validated algorithm. Exposure to the following risk factors was assessed: smoking, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, alcoholism, high blood pressure, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, Parkinson's disease, depressive disorder and rurality. Logistic regression models were estimated to assess the association between risk factors and dementia, and they were stratified by age, sex and both jointly.
The association between a medical history of cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson, depressive disorder or hyperthyroidism and dementia was more pronounced in men. The inverse association between coronary heart disease, heart failure or smoking and dementia was significant only in women. A stronger association was observed in younger age groups for most risk factors, but hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure or smoking were negatively associated among the older age groups.
Sex and age both condition the association between risk factors and dementia. We recommend promoting effective control of cardiovascular risk factors in order to prevent dementia.
Efecto de la edad y el sexo en los factores asociados a la demencia.
Introducción. Actualmente no existe ningún tratamiento curativo para la demencia por lo que se considera que su prevención es clave. El objetivo es analizar la asociación entre los factores de riesgo y la demencia, y su variación según la edad y el sexo. Pacientes y métodos. Este estudio transversal incluye a 1.048.956 personas de 65 años o más. Los datos se obtuvieron de la base de datos clínicos pseudoanonimizados SIDIAP. La variable respuesta fue la demencia y se identificaron los casos mediante un algoritmo validado. Se evaluó la exposición a los siguientes factores de riesgo: tabaquismo, enfermedad coronaria, enfermedad cerebrovascular, insuficiencia cardíaca, arteriopatía periférica, alcoholismo, hipertensión arterial, hiperlipidemia, diabetes, hipertiroidismo, Parkinson, trastorno depresivo y ruralidad. Se calcularon modelos de regresión logística para evaluar la asociación de los factores de riesgo y la demencia, y se estratificó por edad, sexo y ambos conjuntamente. Resultados. La asociación entre los antecedentes de enfermedad cerebrovascular, el Parkinson, el trastorno depresivo o el hipertiroidismo y la demencia fue más pronunciada en los hombres. La asociación inversa entre la enfermedad coronaria, la insuficiencia cardíaca o el tabaquismo con la demencia fue significativa sólo en las mujeres. Se observó una mayor asociación en los grupos de menor edad en la mayoría de los factores de riesgo. Conclusión. El sexo y la edad condicionan la asociación de los factores de riesgo y la demencia.

33583444",Sex-related associations between body height and cognitive impairment among low-income elderly adults in rural China: a population-based cross-sectional study.,"Body height is a marker of childhood health and cumulative net nutrition during growth periods. However, sex-specific associations between body height and cognitive impairment are not well known in northern rural China.
We assessed sex differences in the association between body height and cognitive impairment in a low-income elderly population in rural China. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2014 to August 2014 to collect basic information from elderly residents aged 60 years and older in rural areas of Tianjin, China. Body height and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were measured, and the relationships between these variables were assessed.
A total of 1081 residents with a mean age of 67.7 years were enrolled in this study. After adjusting for age, educational attainment, smoking status, drinking status, and the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, higher body height was found to be associated with a decreased prevalence of cognitive impairment in elderly men. Each 1-dm increase in height was associated with a 37% decrease in the prevalence of cognitive impairment. However, there was no significant association between body height and cognitive impairment among elderly women.
In conclusion, shorter body height was related to cognitive impairment independently of age, educational attainment, lifestyle factors, and health-related comorbid factors among low-income elderly men in rural China. Accordingly, shorter elderly men may be targeted for effective dementia prevention in rural China.","['Body height', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Epidemiology', 'Population-based study', 'Sex difference']",Biology of sex differences,2021-12-08,"[{'lastname': 'Qi', 'firstname': 'Dongwang', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Yiwu Central Hospital & The Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 699 Jiangdong Road, Yiwu City, 322000, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Chanhong', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Yiwu Central Hospital & The Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 699 Jiangdong Road, Yiwu City, 322000, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Mao', 'firstname': 'Rongyan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Yiwu Central Hospital & The Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 699 Jiangdong Road, Yiwu City, 322000, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xuewei', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Yiwu Central Hospital & The Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 699 Jiangdong Road, Yiwu City, 322000, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Jinhui', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Yiwu Central Hospital & The Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 699 Jiangdong Road, Yiwu City, 322000, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yanjia', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Yiwu Central Hospital &The Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 699 Jiangdong Road, Yiwu City, 322000, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tu', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.\nLaboratory of Epidemiology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.\nTianjin Neurological Institute, Key Laboratory of Post-Neuroinjury Neuro-Repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education and Tianjin City, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jinghua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. jwang3@tmu.edu.cn.\nLaboratory of Epidemiology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. jwang3@tmu.edu.cn.\nTianjin Neurological Institute, Key Laboratory of Post-Neuroinjury Neuro-Repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education and Tianjin City, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. jwang3@tmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Ning', 'firstname': 'Xianjia', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. xning@tmu.edu.cn.\nLaboratory of Epidemiology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. xning@tmu.edu.cn.\nTianjin Neurological Institute, Key Laboratory of Post-Neuroinjury Neuro-Repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education and Tianjin City, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. xning@tmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Yiwu Central Hospital & The Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 699 Jiangdong Road, Yiwu City, 322000, Zhejiang, China. snwuyi@163.com.'}]",,"In conclusion, shorter body height was related to cognitive impairment independently of age, educational attainment, lifestyle factors, and health-related comorbid factors among low-income elderly men in rural China.

30098888",Association Between Cataract Extraction and Development of Dementia.,"Visual function is important for older adults. Interventions to preserve vision, such as cataract extraction, may modify dementia risk.
To determine whether cataract extraction is associated with reduced risk of dementia among older adults.
This prospective, longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from the Adult Changes in Thought study, an ongoing, population-based cohort of randomly selected, cognitively normal members of Kaiser Permanente Washington. Study participants were 65 years of age or older and dementia free at enrollment and were followed up biennially until incident dementia (all-cause, Alzheimer disease, or Alzheimer disease and related dementia). Only participants who had a diagnosis of cataract or glaucoma before enrollment or during follow-up were included in the analyses (ie, a total of 3038 participants). Data used in the analyses were collected from 1994 through September 30, 2018, and all data were analyzed from April 6, 2019, to September 15, 2021.
The primary exposure of interest was cataract extraction. Data on diagnosis of cataract or glaucoma and exposure to surgery were extracted from electronic medical records. Extensive lists of dementia-related risk factors and health-related variables were obtained from study visit data and electronic medical records.
The primary outcome was dementia as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted with the primary outcome. To address potential healthy patient bias, weighted marginal structural models incorporating the probability of surgery were used and the association of dementia with glaucoma surgery, which does not restore vision, was evaluated.
In total, 3038 participants were included (mean [SD] age at first cataract diagnosis, 74.4 (6.2) years; 1800 women (59%) and 1238 men (41%); and 2752 (91%) self-reported White race). Based on 23 554 person-years of follow-up, cataract extraction was associated with significantly reduced risk (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62-0.83; P < .001) of dementia compared with participants without surgery after controlling for years of education, self-reported White race, and smoking history and stratifying by apolipoprotein E genotype, sex, and age group at cataract diagnosis. Similar results were obtained in marginal structural models after adjusting for an extensive list of potential confounders. Glaucoma surgery did not have a significant association with dementia risk (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.75-1.56; P = .68).

33162196",Loneliness and its predictors among older adults prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional and longitudinal survey findings from participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort in the USA.,"We aimed to ascertain the prevalence of perceived loneliness among older adults following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine factors contributing to the perception of loneliness.
Cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort.
The ARIC Study cohort, a prospective cohort that recruited (1987-1989) participants from four distinct communities in the USA.
2984 ARIC cohort members.
Perceived loneliness assessed using the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) UCLA three-item Loneliness Scale telephone interviews conducted May-October 2020 and prior to March 2020.
Of the total 5037 participants alive in 2020, 2984 (56.2%) responded to the UCLA three-item questionnaire (mean age 82.6 (SD 4.6) years, 586 (19.6%) black participants, 1081 (36.2%) men), of which 66 (2.2%) reported having had a COVID-19 infection during the observation period. The proportion of participants reporting feeling lonely was 56.3% (n=1680). Among participants with repeat measures of loneliness (n=516), 35.2% (n=182) reported feeling more lonely following pandemic onset. Self-rated health and emotional resilience were strongly associated with self-perceived loneliness. The burden of COVID-19 infections, concern about the pandemic and decreased self-reported physical activity were greater among black as compared with white participants and among those with an educational attainment of less than high school as compared with high school or more.

300,34854749,Androgen Deprivation Therapy and the Risk of Dementia after Treatment for Prostate Cancer.,"The association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and dementia in men with prostate cancer remains inconclusive. We assessed the association between cumulative ADT exposure and the onset of dementia in a nationwide longitudinal registry of men with prostate cancer.
A retrospective analysis of men aged ≥50 years from the CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) registry was performed. The primary outcome was onset of dementia after primary treatment. ADT exposure was expressed as a time-varying independent variable of total ADT exposure. The probability of receiving ADT was estimated using a propensity score. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine the association between ADT exposure and dementia with competing risk of death, adjusted for propensity score and clinical covariates among men receiving various treatments.
Of 13,570 men 317 (2.3%) were diagnosed with dementia after a median of 7.0 years (IQR 3.0-12.0) of followup. Cumulative ADT use was significantly associated with dementia (HR 2.02; 95% CI 1.40-2.91; p <0.01) after adjustment. In a subset of 8,506 men, where propensity score matched by whether or not they received ADT, there was also an association between ADT use and dementia (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.03-2.44; p=0.04).

20670828",Association of L-α Glycerylphosphorylcholine With Subsequent Stroke Risk After 10 Years.,"L-α glycerylphosphorylcholine (α-GPC, choline alphoscerate) is used globally by individuals older than 50 years based on its potential function as a precursor of acetylcholine. However, choline has previously been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease via trimethylamine-N-oxide, a metabolite of choline by microbiota.
To investigate the association between α-GPC use and subsequent 10-year stroke risk.
A population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea. Participants included men and women aged 50 years or older without underlying stroke or Alzheimer disease (N = 12 008 977).
All participants were divided into whether they were prescribed α-GPC during 2006-2008. α-GPC users were matched with nonusers for all covariates to create a matched cohort. α-GPC use was further divided into durations less than 2, 2 to 6, 6 to 12, and more than 12 months of α-GPC prescriptions. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs for total stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke from January 1, 2009, to January 31, 2018, were calculated by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression.
A total of 12 008 977 individuals (6 401 965 [53.3%] women) aged 50 years or older were included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 61.6 (9.4) years for nonusers and 68.3 (10.0) years for users, and that of the matching cohort was 68.2 (9.9) years for both groups. Compared with α-GPC nonusers (n = 11 900 100), users (n = 108 877) had a higher risk for total stroke (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.43-1.48), ischemic stroke (aHR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.33-1.39), and hemorrhagic stroke (aHR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28-1.44). After matching for all covariates, α-GPC users had a higher risk for total stroke (aHR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.41-1.46), ischemic stroke (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.31-1.37), and hemorrhagic stroke (aHR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.29-1.46). Increasing intake of α-GPC was associated with a higher risk for total stroke in a dose-response manner.
In this cohort study, use of α-GPC was associated with a higher 10-year incident stroke risk in a dose-response manner after adjusting for traditional cerebrovascular risk factors. Future studies are needed to determine the possible mechanisms behind the potential cerebrovascular risk-elevating effects of α-GPC.",[],JAMA network open,2021-11-25,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Gyeongsil', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Seulggie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Jooyoung', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Daein', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Beth Israel Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Son', 'firstname': 'Joung Sik', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Kyuwoong', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Sung Min', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeong', 'firstname': 'Seogsong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Sang Min', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.'}]",,,"A total of 12 008 977 individuals (6 401 965 [53.3%] women) aged 50 years or older were included in the study.

28043934","Sex Differences in the Relation Between Subjective Memory Complaints, Impairments in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and Risk of Dementia.","Older people with subjective memory complaints (SMC) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living impairments (IADL-I) have an increased risk of developing dementia. Previous reports suggest that the predictive value of SMC and IADL-I may differ between sexes, leaving possible consequences for personalized risk prediction and prognosis. However, none of these studies addressed the competing risk of death, which may substantially differ between sexes.
We investigated sex-differences in the association between IADL-I, SMC, and incident dementia and mortality as competing risk.
3,409 community-dwelling older people without dementia (mean age 74.3±2.5), were followed for 6.7 years (median). Baseline SMC were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale memory question, and IADL-I using the Academic Medical Center Linear Disability Score. Potential sex-differences in the predictive value of SMC and IADL-I were assessed using Cox regression models with an interaction term for sex.
HRs for isolated SMC and SMC + IADL-I and risk of dementia were higher in women (HR: 2.02, 95% CI = 0.91-4.46, p = 0.08; HR:2.85, 95% CI = 1.65-4.91, p < 0.001) than in men (HR:1.52, 95% CI = 0.86-2.69, p = 0.18; HR:1.24, 95% CI = 0.62-2.49, p = 0.54), but these sex-differences were not significant. Conversely, HRs for isolated IADL-I and risk of mortality were higher in men (HR:1.56, 95% CI = 1.18-2.05, p = 0.002) than in women (HR:1.14, 95% CI = 0.80-1.62, p = 0.48), but again, these sex-differences were not significant.
The predictive value of SMC and IADL-I for the risk of dementia and mortality was not significantly modified by sex. However, the competing risk of death for these factors differed considerably between men and women, suggesting it is an essential factor to consider when comparing sex-differences in IADL/dementia risk.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Instrumental Activities of Daily Living', 'dementia', 'sex', 'subjective memory complaints']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Abdulrahman', 'firstname': 'Herrer', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nRadboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Department of Neurology, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Richard', 'firstname': 'Edo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Department of Neurology, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.\nAmsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Public and Occupational Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Gool', 'firstname': 'Willem A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nAmsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Public and Occupational Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Moll van Charante', 'firstname': 'Eric P', 'initials': 'EP', 'affiliation': 'Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nAmsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Public and Occupational Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Dalen', 'firstname': 'Jan Willem', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nAmsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Public and Occupational Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}]",,"The predictive value of SMC and IADL-I for the risk of dementia and mortality was not significantly modified by sex.

This two-phase prospective cohort study evaluated a representative cluster sample of 1370 individuals aged 60 years old and over from three different socioeconomic levels. The community screening phase consisted of a tested combination of cognitive and functional tests administered among the subjects and informants. In the hospital diagnosis phase, the Cambridge Examination was performed; the diagnosis of dementia and dementia subtypes was made according to DSM IV criteria. Incidence rates were expressed in person-years, multiplied by 1000. The risk of developing dementia was calculated using Cox regression.
Among 1370 eligible subjects, 678 were accessed, and 489 completed the evaluation. Forty-two subjects were diagnosed with dementia. The incidence rate of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were 11.2 (95% CI: 8.0-15.1) and 8.9 (95% CI: 6.1-12.5) per 1000 person-years, respectively; there were high age-specific rates of dementia among younger individuals. There was a trend of a higher risk of developing AD for women than for men. Multivariate analysis showed that older age, the presence of diabetes and the presence of amnestic MCI increased the risk of developing dementia.
The age-specific rates in younger individuals were expressively higher than in worldwide studies and supposedly affected by cardiovascular morbidity. The higher risk in women in a younger sample corroborated the interaction between sex and AD. The increased risk of amnestic MCI reinforced its contribution to the progression to dementia and AD.","['dementia', 'developing countries', 'epidemiology', 'incidence', 'longitudinal studies']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2021-11-22,"[{'lastname': 'Lopes', 'firstname': 'Marcos Antonio', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Nassar', 'firstname': 'Silvia Modesto', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Informatics and Statistics Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcelos-Ferreira', 'firstname': 'Ricardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Department, Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Folquitto', 'firstname': 'Jefferson Cunha', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Old Age Research Group, Psychiatry Institute, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Litvoc', 'firstname': 'Júlio', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Preventive Medicine Department, School of Medicine, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}]",,,"Among 1370 eligible subjects, 678 were accessed, and 489 completed the evaluation.

304,34796750,Oral Status and Dementia Onset: Mediation of Nutritional and Social Factors.,"Some modifiable risk factors for dementia are closely related to oral health. Although eating and speaking abilities are fundamental oral functions, limited studies have focused on the effect of malnutrition and lack of social interaction between oral health and dementia. We investigated the mediating effects of nutritional and social factors on the association between the number of teeth and the incidence of dementia. This 6-y cohort study used data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study targeting older adults aged 65 y and above. The number of teeth (exposure) and covariates in 2010 (baseline survey), mediators (weight loss, vegetable and fruit intake, homeboundness, social network) in 2013, and the onset of dementia (outcome) between 2013 and 2016 were obtained. The Karlson-Holm-Breen mediation method was applied. A total of 35,744 participants were included (54.0% women). The mean age at baseline was 73.1 ± 5.5 y for men and 73.2 ± 5.5 y for women. A total of 1,776 participants (5.0%) had dementia during the follow-up period. There was a significant total effect of the number of teeth on the onset of dementia (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28). Controlling for nutritional and social mediators, the effect of the number of teeth was reduced to 1.10 (95% CI, 0.98-1.25), leaving an indirect effect of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.02-1.04). In the sex-stratified analysis, the proportion mediated by weight loss was 6.35% for men and 4.07% for women. The proportions mediated by vegetable and fruit intake and homeboundness were 4.44% and 4.83% for men and 8.45% and 0.93% for women, respectively. Furthermore, the proportion mediated by social networks was 13.79% for men and 4.00% for women. Tooth loss was associated with the onset of dementia. Nutritional and social factors partially mediated this association.","['cohort studies', 'dental public health', 'epidemiology', 'gerontology', 'nutrition/nutritional sciences', 'psychosocial factors']",Journal of dental research,2021-11-20,"[{'lastname': 'Kiuchi', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry, Miyagi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Cooray', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry, Miyagi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kusama', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry, Miyagi, Japan.\nDivision for Regional Community Development, Liaison Center for Innovative Dentistry, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Promotion, National Institute of Public Health, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbas', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry, Miyagi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakazawa', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry, Miyagi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kondo', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Preventive Medical Sciences, Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.\nDepartment of Gerontological Evaluation, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Osaka', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry, Miyagi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Aida', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division for Regional Community Development, Liaison Center for Innovative Dentistry, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Japan.\nDepartment of Oral Health Promotion, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.'}]",,,,,10.1177/00220345211049399,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05de89c590>,,,,,,

306,34791978,Sex differences in predictors for cognitive decline and dementia in people with stroke or transient ischemic attack in the PROGRESS trial.,"Stroke and transient ischemic attack confer greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia.
We used data from the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a blood pressure-lowering randomized controlled trial in stroke/transient ischemic attack. We evaluated overall and sex-specific differences in treatment effects for cognitive decline/dementia, as well as associations with vascular and stroke-specific predictors,considering death as a competing risk.
Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate overall and sex-specific odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence intervals (CI)) for treatment effects and predictors associated with the risk of cognitive decline/dementia, and the women-to-men ratio of odds ratio (RORs).
Over a median four years, 763 cognitive decline/dementia (30.9% women) were recorded in 5888 participants. Women had lower odds of cognitive decline/dementia than men (OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.63-0.95). Active treatment was associated with lower odds of cognitive decline/dementia (0.84, 0.72-0.98), with no evidence of sex difference. Higher education (0.96,0.94-0.98 (per year)) and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) were associated with lower odds of cognitive decline/dementia (0.84,0.82-0.86 (per point higher)). Higher diastolic blood pressure (1.11,1.02-1.20 (per 10 mmHg)), low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m
Several risk factors were associated with cognitive decline/dementia in people with prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, with notable sex differences. Long-term cognitive sequelae of stroke should be considered to strengthen joint prevention strategies for stroke, cognitive decline, and dementia.","['Stroke', 'cognitive decline', 'competing risk', 'dementia', 'sex difference']",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2021-11-19,"[{'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tzourio', 'firstname': 'Christophe', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, Bordeaux University, INSERM, Bordeaux, France.\nHospital Center Bordeaux University, Bordeaux, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Harrap', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Naismith', 'firstname': 'Sharon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.\nBrain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Anderson', 'firstname': 'Craig S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'George Institute China, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.\nNeurology Department, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney Health Partners, Sydney, Australia.\nHeart Health Research Center, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chalmers', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodward', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.\nGeorge Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}]",,,"Over a median four years, 763 cognitive decline/dementia (30.9% women) were recorded in 5888 participants.

307,34791639,Mid-life extrapyramidal symptoms predict cognitive impairment 23 years later.,"The prevalence of dementia is growing rapidly worldwide. The early identification and treatment of cognitive decline could reduce the burden on the health care system. Our objective was to investigate whether factors measured at an examination at age 50 predict cognitive impairment (CI) 23 years later.
In 1993 we enrolled a randomly selected sample of 798 men, 50 years of age, from the general population. They all underwent a physical examination, provided blood samples and filled out questionnaires addressing lifestyle and psychosocial factors. Cognitive testing was offered to all participants still alive in 2016, at age 73.
A total of 333 men participated in the cognitive study, of which 80 (24.0%) performed at a level corresponding to mild cognitive impairment, and four (1.2%) at a level consistent with severe cognitive impairment. After the first step in the multivariable analysis, hypertension, heavy smoking, high intake of alcohol, financial stress, difficulty falling asleep, and cogwheel rigidity were associated with cognitive impairment. After further adjustment, only wide waist circumference measured in cm (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, p = .04), leg pendulousness (OR 41.97, 95% CI 3.27-538.62, p = .004) and self-assessed hidden irritability (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.10-4.32, p = .03) at baseline, remained as being associated with cognitive impairment 23 years later.
Extrapyramidal symptoms such as leg pendulousness, at the age of 50, may be an indicator for very early identification of future cognitive decline.","['dementia', 'extrapyramidal symptoms', 'longitudinal cohort study', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'risk factors']",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,2021-11-19,"[{'lastname': 'Holtback', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Welin', 'firstname': 'Catharina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medicine, Geriatrics and Emergency Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Västra Götaland, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Thunström', 'firstname': 'Erik', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medicine, Geriatrics and Emergency Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Västra Götaland, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosengren', 'firstname': 'Annika', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medicine, Geriatrics and Emergency Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Västra Götaland, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Lappas', 'firstname': 'Georgios', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Hansson', 'firstname': 'Per-Olof', 'initials': 'PO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medicine, Geriatrics and Emergency Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Västra Götaland, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}]",,,"A total of 333 men participated in the cognitive study, of which 80 (24.0%) performed at a level corresponding to mild cognitive impairment, and four (1.2%) at a level consistent with severe cognitive impairment.

23217531",Gait changes over time in hospitalized older adults with advanced dementia: Predictors of mobility change.,"People with dementia are at risk of mobility decline. In this study, we measured changes in quantitative gait measures over a maximum 10-week period during the course of a psychogeriatric admission in older adults with dementia, with the aims to describe mobility changes over the duration of the admission, and to determine which factors were associated with this change. Fifty-four individuals admitted to a specialized dementia inpatient unit participated in this study. A vision-based markerless motion capture system was used to record participants' natural gait. Mixed effect models were developed with gait measures as the dependent variables and clinical and demographic variables as predictors. We found that gait stability, step time, and step length decreased, and step time variability and step length variability increased over 10 weeks. Gait stability of men decreased more than that of women, associated with an increased sacrum mediolateral range of motion over time. In addition, the sacrum mediolateral range of motion decreased in those with mild neuropsychiatric symptoms over 10 weeks, but increased in those with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our study provides evidence of worsening of gait mechanics and control over the course of a hospitalization in older adults with dementia. Quantitative gait monitoring in hospital environments may provide opportunities to intervene to prevent adverse events, decelerate mobility decline, and monitor rehabilitation outcomes.",[],PloS one,2021-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Mehdizadeh', 'firstname': 'Sina', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'KITE- Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Faieghi', 'firstname': 'Mohammadreza', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'KITE- Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sabo', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'KITE- Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Nabavi', 'firstname': 'Hoda', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'KITE- Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Mansfield', 'firstname': 'Avril', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'KITE- Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nEvaluative Clinical Sciences, Hurvitz Brain Sciences Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nDepartment of Physical Therapy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Flint', 'firstname': 'Alastair J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nCentre for Mental Health, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Taati', 'firstname': 'Babak', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'KITE- Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nInstitute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nVector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Iaboni', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'KITE- Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nCentre for Mental Health, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0259975

309,34781706,Increased COVID-19 Mortality in People With Previous Cerebrovascular Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"The aim of the study was to determine the association between previous stroke and mortality after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) according to sex, age groups, and stroke subtypes.
Prospective population-based cohort study including all COVID-19 positive cases between February 1 and July 31, 2020. Comorbidities and mortality were extracted using linked health administration databases. Previous stroke included transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, and combined stroke for cases with more than one category. Other comorbidities were obesity, diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, dementia, individual socioeconomic index, and deprivation index. Cases were followed up until December 31, 2020. Primary outcome was mortality of any cause after COVID-19 positivity. Cox proportional regression analysis adjusted for comorbidities was used. Stratified analyses were performed for sex and age (<60, 60-79, and ≥80 years).
There were 91 629 COVID-19 cases. Previous strokes were 5752 (6.27%), of which 3887 (67.57%) were ischemic, 1237 (21.50%) transient ischemic attack, 255 (4.43%) combined, 203 (3.53%) hemorrhagic, and 170 (2.96%) subarachnoid hemorrhage.

310,34776435,A Decade of Decline in Serious Cognitive Problems Among Older Americans: A Population-Based Study of 5.4 Million Respondents.,"Numerous studies suggest the prevalence of dementia has decreased over the past several decades in Western countries. Less is known about whether these trends differ by gender or age cohort, and if generational differences in educational attainment explain these trajectories.
1) To detect temporal trends in the age-sex-race adjusted prevalence of serious cognitive problems among Americans aged 65+; 2) To establish if these temporal trends differ by gender and age cohort; 3) To examine if these temporal trends are attenuated by generational differences in educational attainment.
Secondary analysis of 10 years of annual nationally representative data from the American Community Survey with 5.4 million community-dwelling and institutionalized older adults aged 65+. The question on serious cognitive problems was, ""Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does this person have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?""
The prevalence of serious cognitive problems in the US population aged 65 and older declined from 12.2% to 10.0% between 2008 and 2017. Had the prevalence remained at the 2008 levels, there would have been an additional 1.13 million older Americans with serious cognitive problems in 2017. The decline in memory problems across the decade was higher for women (23%) than for men (13%). Adjusting for education substantially attenuated the decline.
Between 2008 and 2017, the prevalence of serious cognitive impairment among older Americans declined significantly, although these declines were partially attributable to generational differences in educational attainment.","['Cognitive impairment', 'dementia', 'memory', 'temporal trends']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-11-16,"[{'lastname': 'Fuller-Thomson', 'firstname': 'Esme', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahlin', 'firstname': 'Katherine Marie', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}]",,"Between 2008 and 2017, the prevalence of serious cognitive impairment among older Americans declined significantly, although these declines were partially attributable to generational differences in educational attainment.","The prevalence of serious cognitive problems in the US population aged 65 and older declined from 12.2% to 10.0% between 2008 and 2017.

311,34758470,Prevalence of Parkinson's Disease in Adults Aged 65 Years and Older in China: A Multicenter Population-Based Survey.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. With the aging of the Chinese population, it is important to understand the prevalence of PD in the elderly.
Little data are available on the current prevalence of PD in China. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PD in Chinese individuals aged 65 years and older and to analyze associated risk factors.
We performed a population-based cross-sectional survey using a multistage cluster sampling design. Residents aged 65 years and older were drawn from 11 urban districts and 10 rural counties across China. Data were entered into spreadsheets and analyzed using SPSS 24.
We identified 151 patients with PD among 8,124 residents aged 65 years and over, including 75 men and 76 women. The overall prevalence of PD in the study population was 1.86%, and the standardized prevalence of PD was 1.60%. The crude prevalence in men (2.12%) was higher than that in women (1.66%) and the standardized prevalence in urban areas (1.98%) was higher than that in rural areas (1.48%). Logistic regression analysis showed that independent risk factors for PD were older age, heavy metal or pesticide exposure, urban residence, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and heart disease.
The prevalence of PD among individuals aged 65 years and older in China has remained constant. The prevalence of PD is higher in men than in women and higher in urban areas than in rural areas.","['China', 'Elderly', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'Prevalence']",Neuroepidemiology,2021-11-11,"[{'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Zhengyu', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China, zjk_hr@163.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Shuai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Tianjin Dementia Institute, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Neurology, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiyu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Meilin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Science, School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiaodan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Tianjin Dementia Institute, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Neurology, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Zhihong', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Tianjin Dementia Institute, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Neurology, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ji', 'firstname': 'Yong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Tianjin Dementia Institute, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.\nDepartment of Neurology, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Tianjin, China.\nChina National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases, Beijing, China.\nDepartment of Neurology Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.'}]",,,"We identified 151 patients with PD among 8,124 residents aged 65 years and over, including 75 men and 76 women.

29232761","Social isolation, social support, and loneliness and their relationship with cognitive health and dementia.","Poor social health is prevalent in older adults and may be associated with worse cognition, and increased dementia risk. The aim of this study was to determine whether social isolation, social support and loneliness are independently associated with cognitive function and incident dementia over 5 years in older adults, and to investigate potential gender differences.
Participants were 11,498 community-dwelling relatively healthy Australians aged 70-94, in the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP). Social isolation, social support, loneliness and cognitive function were assessed through self-report. Outcomes examined were cognitive decline (>1.5 SD decline in cognitive performance since baseline) and incident dementia (adjudicated according to DSM-IV criteria).
Most participants self-reported good social health (92%) with very few socially isolated (2%), with low social support (2%) or lonely (5%). Among women, social isolation and low social support were consistently associated with lower cognitive function (e.g., social support and cognition β = -1.17, p < 0.001). No consistent longitudinal associations were observed between baseline social health and cognitive decline (over median 3.1 years) or incident dementia (over median 4.4 years; social isolation: HR = 1.00, p = 0.99; low social support: HR = 1.79, p = 0.11; loneliness: HR = 0.72, p = 0.34 among women and men).
Our study provides evidence that social isolation and a low social support are associated with worse cognitive function in women, but not men. Social health did not predict incident cognitive decline or dementia, but we lacked power to stratify dementia analyses by gender.","['age factors', 'aged', 'aged 80 and over', 'ageing', 'cognition', 'cognitive health', 'dementia', 'geriatrics', 'interpersonal relations', 'loneliness', 'older adult', 'social connection', 'social interaction', 'social isolation', 'social support']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2021-11-07,"[{'lastname': 'Joyce', 'firstname': 'Johanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Owen', 'firstname': 'Alice', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Jessie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McHugh Power', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Business, National College of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Raj', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Family Medicine and Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Woods', 'firstname': 'Robyn', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Storey', 'firstname': 'Elsdon', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Britt', 'firstname': 'Carlene', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Freak-Poli', 'firstname': 'Rosanne', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health\xa0& Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,"Our study provides evidence that social isolation and a low social support are associated with worse cognitive function in women, but not men.

APOE ε4 was associated with less strength in multiple networks, while '650 G versus A carriage was related to more language comprehension network strength. In APOE ε4 carriers, '650 G-carriage led to less network strength with increasing age, while in non-G-carriers this was only seen in women but not men.

28529545","Low Blood Pressure, Comorbidities, and Ischemic Stroke Mortality in US Veterans.","Low blood pressure (BP) is associated with higher stroke mortality, although the factors underlying this association have not been fully explored. We investigated prestroke BP and long-term mortality after ischemic stroke in a national sample of US veterans.
Using a retrospective cohort study design of veterans hospitalized between 2002 and 2007 with a first ischemic stroke and with ≥1 outpatient BP measurements 1 to 18 months before admission, we defined 6 categories each of average prestroke systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP, and 7 categories of pulse pressure. Patients were followed-up to 12 years for primary outcomes of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. We used Cox models to relate prestroke BP indices to mortality and stratified analyses by the presence of preexisting comorbidities (smoking, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter, cancer, and dementia), race and ethnicity.
Of 29 690 eligible veterans with stroke (mean±SD age 67±12 years, 98% men, 67% White), 2989 (10%) had average prestroke SBP<120 mm Hg. During a follow-up of 4.1±3.3 years, patients with SBP<120 mm Hg experienced 61% all-cause and 27% cardiovascular mortality. In multivariable analyses, patients with the lowest SBP, lowest diastolic BP, and highest pulse pressure had the highest mortality risk: SBP<120 versus 130 to 139 mm Hg (hazard ratio=1.26 [95% CI, 1.19-1.34]); diastolic BP <60 versus 70 to 79 mm Hg (hazard ratio=1.35 [95% CI, 1.23-1.49]); and pulse pressure ≥90 versus 60 to 69 mm Hg (hazard ratio=1.24 [95% CI, 1.15-1.35]). Patients with average SBP<120 mm Hg and at least one comorbidity (smoking, heart disease, cancer, or dementia) had the highest mortality risk (hazard ratio=1.45 [95% CI, 1.37-1.53]).
Compared with normotension, low prestroke BP was associated with mortality after stroke, particularly among patients with at least one comorbidity.","['blood pressure', 'cerebrovascular disorders', 'epidemiology', 'hypertension', 'mortality']",Stroke,2021-11-04,"[{'lastname': 'Aparicio', 'firstname': 'Hugo J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).\nDepartment of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, MA (H.J.A., S.S.).\nBoston Medical Center, MA (H.J.A.).'}, {'lastname': 'Tarko', 'firstname': 'Laura M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).'}, {'lastname': 'Gagnon', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, MA (D.G., S.D.).'}, {'lastname': 'Costa', 'firstname': 'Lauren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).'}, {'lastname': 'Galloway', 'firstname': 'Ashley', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).'}, {'lastname': 'Demissie', 'firstname': 'Serkalem', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, MA (D.G., S.D.).'}, {'lastname': 'Djousse', 'firstname': 'Luc', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).\nDivision of Aging, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA (L.D., K.C.).""}, {'lastname': 'Seshadri', 'firstname': 'Sudha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).\nDepartment of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, MA (H.J.A., S.S.).\nGlenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's & Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio (S.S.).""}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Kelly', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System (H.J.A., L.M.T., D.G., L.C., A.G., S.D., L.D., S.S., K.C.).\nDivision of Aging, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA (L.D., K.C.).""}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Peter W F', 'initials': 'PWF', 'affiliation': 'Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (P.W.F.W.).\nDivision of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA (P.W.F.W.).\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA (P.W.F.W.).'}]",,,"Of 29 690 eligible veterans with stroke (mean±SD age 67±12 years, 98% men, 67% White), 2989 (10%) had average prestroke SBP<120 mm Hg.

26067923",Benzodiazepine and Z-Drug Use and the Risk of Developing Dementia.,"Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and Z-drugs (BZDRs) are among the most prescribed medications for anxiety and insomnia, especially among older adults. Our objective was to investigate the association between the use of BZDRs and the risk of dementia.
A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted based on the data available from 2002 to 2015 in Catalan Health Service. This cohort included all BZDR users (N = 83 138) and nonusers (N = 84 652) older than 45 years. A minimum 5-year lag window and an adjustment for psychiatric problems were applied for the data analysis.
The hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of incident dementia among BZDR users was 1.22 (95% CI = 1.15 to 1.31). This risk was not significant after adjusting the data confounding factors (HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.94 to 1.08). We observed a higher risk with short-to-intermediate half-life BZDs (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.20) and Z-drugs (HR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.33) than for intermediate-to-long half-life BZDs (HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.94 to 1.08). We demonstrated a higher risk of incident dementia (HR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.41 and odds ratio = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.27 to 1.50, respectively) in patients who received 91 to 180 defined daily doses (DDDs) and >180 DDDs compared with patients who received <90 DDD. Regarding patient sex, the risk of dementia was higher in women than in men.
We found that the incidence of dementia was not higher among all BZDR users. Short half-life BZDs and Z-drugs increased the risk of dementia at the highest doses, especially in female patients, showing a dose-response relationship.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Z-drug', 'benzodiazepine', 'cognitive decline', 'cohort study', 'dementia']",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,2021-11-03,"[{'lastname': 'Torres-Bondia', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacy Department, Clinical Neuroscience Research Group, IRBLleida, Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital, Lleida, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Dakterzada', 'firstname': 'Farida', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Unitat Trastorns Cognitius (Cognitive Disorders Unit), Clinical Neuroscience Research Group, Santa Maria University Hospital, IRBLleida, Lleida, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Galván', 'firstname': 'Leonardo', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacy Department, Servei Català de la Salut (Catalan Health Services), Lleida, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Buti', 'firstname': 'Miquel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Unitat d'Avaluació Clínica (Clinical Evaluation Unit), Institut Català de la Salut (Catalan Institute of Health), Lleida, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Besanson', 'firstname': 'Gaston', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Accenture Innovation Center, Barcelona, Spain.\nBarcelona Graduate School of Economics, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Grill', 'firstname': 'Eric', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Accenture Innovation Center, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Buil', 'firstname': 'Roman', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Accenture Innovation Center, Barcelona, Spain.\nUniversitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'de Batlle', 'firstname': 'Jordi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Group of Translational Research in Respiratory Medicine, Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital and Santa Maria University Hospital, IRBLleida, Lleida, Spain.\nBiomedical Research Networking Center in Respiratory Diseases (Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Respiratorias), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Piñol-Ripoll', 'firstname': 'Gerard', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Unitat Trastorns Cognitius (Cognitive Disorders Unit), Clinical Neuroscience Research Group, Santa Maria University Hospital, IRBLleida, Lleida, Spain.'}]",,"We found that the incidence of dementia was not higher among all BZDR users.

318,34719502,Improving Detection of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment with Sex-Specific Cognitive Norms.,"BackgroundDespite a female advantage in verbal memory, normative data for verbal memory tests used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) often are not sex-adjusted.ObjectiveTo determine whether sex-adjusted norms improve aMCI diagnostic accuracy when accuracy was evaluated by progression to AD dementia over time.MethodsNon-sex-specific and sex-specific verbal memory test norms were incorporated into Jak/Bondi aMCI criteria and applied to older (age 65-90) non-demented women (N = 1,036) and men (N = 355) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Using sex-specific aMCI diagnosis as the ""true"" condition versus non-sex-specific aMCI diagnosis as the ""predicted"" condition, we identified True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives and compared AD dementia risk over 10 years among groups.ResultsRates of aMCI were higher in men versus women (χ2 = 15.39, p < 0.001) when determined based on typical diagnostic criteria, but this difference reversed when using sex-specific diagnostic criteria (χ2 = 8.38, p = 0.004). We identified 8%of women as False Negatives and 12%of men as False Positives. Risk of incident AD dementia in False Positive men was significantly lower than in True Positive men (HR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.12-0.58, p = 0.001). Risk of incident AD dementia in False Negative women was substantially higher than in True Negative women (HR = 3.11, 95%CI = 2.09-4.63, p < 0.001).ConclusionResults suggest that previous reports of higher aMCI rates in men versus women may be an artifact of non-sex-adjusted norms/cut-scores. Incorporation of sex-specific norms/cut-scores for verbal memory impairment into aMCI diagnostic criteria may improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid diagnostic errors in approximately 20%.","['Amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'diagnosis', 'incident Alzheimer’s disease', 'sex differences', 'verbal memory']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-11-02,"[{'lastname': 'Sundermann', 'firstname': 'Erin E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Lisa L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Bondi', 'firstname': 'Mark W', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.\nVeterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bennett', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Salmon', 'firstname': 'David P', 'initials': 'DP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Maki', 'firstname': 'Pauline M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychology and OBGYN, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.'}]",,,,,10.3233/JAD-215260,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dba1bc20>,,,,,,

34129486",Atrial fibrillation and COVID-19 in older patients: how disability contributes to shape the risk profile. An analysis of the GeroCovid registry.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often complicated by disabling conditions in the elderly. COVID-19 has high mortality in older people. This study aimed at evaluating the relationship of pre-infection AF with characteristics and survival of older COVID-19 patients.
We retrospectively analyzed inpatients aged ≥ 60 years enrolled in GeroCovid Observational, a multicenter registry endorsed by the Italian and the Norwegian Societies of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Pre-COVID-19 sociodemographic, functional, and medical data were systematically collected, as well as in-hospital mortality.
Between March and June 2020, 808 COVID-19 subjects were enrolled (age 79 ± 9 years; men 51.7%). The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. AF patients were older (82 ± 8 vs. 77 ± 9 years, p < 0.001), had a higher CHA

321,34637806,Sex-specificities in anxiety and depressive symptoms across the lifespan and their links with multimodal neuroimaging.,"Anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with impaired well-being, higher risk of developing psychoaffective disorders and are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To further understand their relevance and the mechanisms underlying their link with AD, our aims were to assess how anxiety and depressive symptoms changed with age and related to AD neuroimaging biomarkers across the adult lifespan, while also exploring sex specificities.
210 cognitively normal participants aged 19-86 years (101 men, 109 women) completed assessments of anxiety and depressive symptoms with the STAI-A and MADRS respectively, and neuroimaging measurements including structural MRI, FDG-PET and amyloid-PET. 167 of those were followed-up over 1.5-3 years. Multiple regressions were performed to assess the links between anxiety or depressive symptoms versus age, global cognition or each imaging modality, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally; and general linear models we used to test the interactive effect of sex on these associations.
Depressive symptoms decreased with age, while anxiety symptoms increased only among women. Higher anxiety symptoms were associated with lower grey matter (GM) volume and glucose metabolism, with an interaction of sex, this relationship being significant only in women. Longitudinally, only low baseline GM volume predicted an increase in anxiety symptoms with time.
Only 43% of participants reported depressive symptoms. Despite additional analyses, the low variability in the measure might have prevented us from detecting subtle changes.
This study emphasizes the need to consider anxiety symptoms in assessments for dementia risk, particularly in women.","['Ageing', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Atrophy', 'Glucose metabolism', 'Mental health']",Journal of affective disorders,2021-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Moulinet', 'firstname': 'Inès', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, U1237, PhIND Physiopathology and Imaging of Neurological Disorders, Institute Blood and Brain @ Caen-Normandie (BB@C), GIP Cyceron, 4 Bvd Henri Becquerel, Caen 14000, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Landeau', 'firstname': 'Brigitte', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, U1237, PhIND Physiopathology and Imaging of Neurological Disorders, Institute Blood and Brain @ Caen-Normandie (BB@C), GIP Cyceron, 4 Bvd Henri Becquerel, Caen 14000, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Touron', 'firstname': 'Edelweiss', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, U1237, PhIND Physiopathology and Imaging of Neurological Disorders, Institute Blood and Brain @ Caen-Normandie (BB@C), GIP Cyceron, 4 Bvd Henri Becquerel, Caen 14000, France.'}, {'lastname': 'De La Sayette', 'firstname': 'Vincent', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, EPHE, INSERM, U1077, PSL Recherche Universités, CHU de Caen, Neuropsychologie et Imagerie de la Mémoire Humaine, GIP Cyceron, Caen 14000, France; Service de Neurologie, CHU de Caen, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Desgranges', 'firstname': 'Béatrice', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, EPHE, INSERM, U1077, PSL Recherche Universités, CHU de Caen, Neuropsychologie et Imagerie de la Mémoire Humaine, GIP Cyceron, Caen 14000, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Vivien', 'firstname': 'Denis', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, U1237, PhIND Physiopathology and Imaging of Neurological Disorders, Institute Blood and Brain @ Caen-Normandie (BB@C), GIP Cyceron, 4 Bvd Henri Becquerel, Caen 14000, France; Department of Clinical Research, Caen Normandy Hospital (CHU) de Caen, Caen 14000, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Marchant', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Poisnel', 'firstname': 'Géraldine', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, U1237, PhIND Physiopathology and Imaging of Neurological Disorders, Institute Blood and Brain @ Caen-Normandie (BB@C), GIP Cyceron, 4 Bvd Henri Becquerel, Caen 14000, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Chételat', 'firstname': 'Gaël', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, U1237, PhIND Physiopathology and Imaging of Neurological Disorders, Institute Blood and Brain @ Caen-Normandie (BB@C), GIP Cyceron, 4 Bvd Henri Becquerel, Caen 14000, France.

28269773",Gender differences in cognitive reserve: implication for subjective cognitive decline in women.,"Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is a self-experienced decline in cognitive capacity with normal performance on standardized cognitive tests, showing to increase risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cognitive reserve seems to influence the progression from SCD to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and to AD. The aim of our study was to investigate gender differences in cognitive reserve evaluating how sex might modulate the role of cognitive reserve on SCD.
We included 381 SCD patients who underwent clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessment, evaluation of premorbid intelligence by the Test di Intelligenza Breve (TIB), cognitive complaints by the Memory Assessment Clinics Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping.
The proportion between women and men was significantly different (68.7% [95% CI 63.9-73.4 vs 31.4%, 95% CI 26.6-36.0]). Women were younger than men at onset of SCD and at the baseline visit (p = 0.021), had lower years of education (p = 0.007), lower TIB scores (p < 0.001), and higher MAC-Q scores (p = 0.012). TIB was directly associated with age at onset of SCD in both women and men, while years of education was inversely associated with age at onset only in women. Multivariate analysis showed that sex influences TIB independently from years of education. TIB was directly associated with MAC-Q in men.
Sex interacts with premorbid intelligence and education level in influencing the age at onset and the severity of SCD. As the effect of education was different between men and women, we speculated that education might act as a minor contributor of cognitive reserve in women.","['Cognitive reserve', 'Gender differences', 'Sex', 'Subjective cognitive decline']",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2021-10-10,"[{'lastname': 'Giacomucci', 'firstname': 'Giulia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mazzeo', 'firstname': 'Salvatore', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy.\nIRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Padiglioni', 'firstname': 'Sonia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Regional Referral Centre for Relational Criticalities - Tuscany Region, Florence, Italy.\nUnit Clinic of Organizations Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bagnoli', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Belloni', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Regional Referral Centre for Relational Criticalities - Tuscany Region, Florence, Italy.\nUnit Clinic of Organizations Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'Camilla', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bracco', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Nacmias', 'firstname': 'Benedetta', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy.\nIRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Sorbi', 'firstname': 'Sandro', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy.\nIRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bessi', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Largo Brambilla, 3, 50134, Florence, Italy. valentina.bessi@unifi.it.'}]",,,"The proportion between women and men was significantly different (68.7% [95% CI 63.9-73.4 vs 31.4%, 95% CI 26.6-36.0]).

324,34624929,"Association of coffee, green tea, and caffeine with the risk of dementia in older Japanese people.","Coffee, green tea, and caffeine are potential preventive factors for dementia, but the underlying evidence is insufficient. This study aimed to examine associations between the consumption of coffee, green tea, and caffeine and dementia risk in middle-aged and older people.
This was a cohort study with an 8.0-year follow-up. Participants were community-dwelling individuals (n = 13,757) aged 40-74 years. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in 2011-2013. Predictors were the consumption of coffee/green tea, from which caffeine consumption was estimated. The outcome was incident dementia obtained from the long-term care insurance database. Covariates were demographic factors, body mass index, physical activity, energy, smoking, drinking, and disease history. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. HRs were also calculated using a Cox model with delayed entry.
The number of dementia cases during the study period was 309. Participants with higher coffee consumption had lower HRs (adjusted p for trend = 0.0014), with the fifth quintile (≥326 ml/day) having a significantly lower HR (0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.79) than the first quintile (<26 ml/day, reference). Similarly, participants with higher caffeine consumption had a significantly lower HR (adjusted p for trend = 0.0004) than the reference. The Cox model with delayed entry yielded similar results. These associations were significant in men, but not in women. Moreover, participants who consumed 2-2.9 cups/day and ≥3 cups/day of coffee had lower HRs (0.69, 95% CI: 0.48-0.98 and 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31-0.89, respectively) than those who consumed 0 cup/day. The association between green tea consumption and reduced dementia risk was significant (adjusted p for trend = 0.0146) only in the 60-69 years age subgroup.
High levels of coffee and caffeine consumption were significantly associated with a reduced dementia risk in a dose-dependent manner, especially in men. Moreover, coffee consumption of ≥3 cups/day was associated with a 50% reduction in dementia risk.","['caffeine', 'coffee', 'cohort studies', 'dementia', 'green tea']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2021-10-09,"[{'lastname': 'Matsushita', 'firstname': 'Nana', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakanishi', 'firstname': 'Yuta', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Yumi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Preventive Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kitamura', 'firstname': 'Kaori', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Preventive Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabasawa', 'firstname': 'Keiko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Promotion Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takahashi', 'firstname': 'Akemi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Niigata University of Rehabilitation, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saito', 'firstname': 'Toshiko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health and Nutrition, Niigata University of Health and Welfare, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kobayashi', 'firstname': 'Ryosaku', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Niigata University of Rehabilitation, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takachi', 'firstname': 'Ribeka', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Nara Women's University Graduate School of Humanities and Sciences, Nara, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Oshiki', 'firstname': 'Rieko', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Niigata University of Rehabilitation, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsugane', 'firstname': 'Shoichiro', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iki', 'firstname': 'Masayuki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sasaki', 'firstname': 'Ayako', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Murakami Public Health Center, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamazaki', 'firstname': 'Osamu', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health and Social Welfare, Niigata Prefectural Government, Niigata Prefectural Office, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Kei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakamura', 'firstname': 'Kazutoshi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Preventive Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.'}]",,,"The number of dementia cases during the study period was 309.

325,34614155,The Relationship Between Fertility History and Incident Dementia in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study.,"An emerging literature suggests that fertility history, which includes measures of parity and birth timing, may influence cognitive health in older ages, especially among women given their differential exposure to pregnancy and sex hormones. Yet, few studies have examined associations between measures of fertility history and incident dementia in population-based samples.
We examined the associations between parity, younger age at first birth, and older age at last birth with incident dementia over a 16-year period in a prospective sample of 15,361 men and women aged 51-100 years at baseline drawn from the Health and Retirement Study. We used Cox regression and the Fine and Gray model to obtain cause-specific hazard ratios (csHRs) and subdistribution hazard ratios for incident dementia from gender-stratified models, with the latter method accounting for the semicompeting risk of death.
During the follow-up period (median 13.0 years), the crude incidence rate for dementia was 16.6 and 19.9 per 1,000 person-years for men and women, respectively. In crude models estimating csHRs, higher parity (vs parity 2) and younger age at first birth were associated with increased risk of dementia for both genders. These associations did not persist after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status, and health conditions, with much of the attenuation in estimates occurring after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics.
In this population-based, multiethnic cohort, we observed limited evidence for an association between measures of fertility history and incident dementia among men and women after adjusting for potential confounders.","['Cognitive health', 'Gender', 'Parity', 'Postreproductive health']","The journals of gerontology.

326,34607490,Motivation and willingness to increase physical activity for dementia risk reduction: Cross-Sectional UK survey with people aged 50 and over.,"Attitudes to increasing physical activity to reduce risk of dementia were assessed in a national online survey promoted via online forums and public adverts. The Motivation to Change Behaviour for Dementia Risk Reduction (MOCHAD-10) scale examined motivation for lifestyle change. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of willingness and motivation to increase physical activity.
Data from 3,948 individuals showed most people were moderately/very physically active (80%). People more likely to be physically active had better health and education, were older, male, and had a partner. People willing to increase physical activity (73%) were more likely to be younger, non-White, underweight, had better health and lifestyles, and had experience caring for someone with dementia. People with higher levels of motivation to change lifestyle (MOCHAD-10 subscales) were more likely to be female, younger, in poorer physical/mental health, had lower perceived mental activity, and were a carer for someone with dementia.
Men and those with better health status were more physically active. Those who exercised less and those who were more motivated to increase physical activity were not necessarily able to be physically active. Multisectoral public health strategies should seek to use the high motivation levels among this group to mitigate the barriers related to physical activity for dementia risk reduction.","['Physical activity', 'behaviour change', 'dementia', 'motivation', 'prevention', 'risk factors']",Aging & mental health,2021-10-06,"[{'lastname': 'Oliveira', 'firstname': 'Déborah', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, Brazil.\nDivision of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Knight', 'firstname': 'Holly', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Katy A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ogollah', 'firstname': 'Reuben', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Orrell', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.'}]",,Men and those with better health status were more physically active.

32157811",Sex Differences in the Association Between Metabolic Dysregulation and Cognitive Aging: The Health and Retirement Study.,"Dysregulation of some metabolic factors increases the risk of dementia. It remains unclear if overall metabolic dysregulation, or only certain components, contribute to cognitive aging and if these associations are sex specific.
Data from the 2006-2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) was used to analyze 7 103 participants aged 65 and older at baseline (58% women). We created a metabolic-dysregulation risk score (MDRS) composed of blood pressure/hypertension status, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)/diabetes status, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and waist circumference, and assessed cognitive trajectories from repeated measures of the HRS-Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (HRS-TICS) over 10 years of follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models estimated associations between MDRS or individual metabolic factors (biomarkers) with mean and change in HRS-TICS scores and assessed sex-modification of these associations.
Participants with higher MDRSs had lower mean HRS-TICS scores, but there were no statistically significant differences in rate of decline. Sex stratification showed this association was present for women only. MDRS biomarkers revealed heterogeneity in the strength and direction of associations with HRS-TICS. Lower HRS-TICS levels were associated with hypertension, higher HbA1c/diabetes, and lower HDL-C and TC, whereas faster rate of cognitive decline was associated with hypertension, higher HbA1c/diabetes, and higher TC. Participants with higher HbA1c/diabetes presented worse cognitive trajectories. Sex differences indicated that women with higher HbA1c/diabetes to have lower HRS-TICS levels, whereas hypertensive males presented better cognitive trajectory.
Our results demonstrate that metabolic dysregulation is more strongly associated with cognition in women compared with men, though sex differences vary by individual biomarker.","['Biomarkers', 'Brain aging', 'Diabetes', 'Epidemiology']","The journals of gerontology.

329,34569688,The plasticity of late-onset dementia: A nationwide cohort study in Denmark.,"The determinants of the secular decline in the incidence of dementia are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of four factors-education, wealth, cerebrovascular health, and general health-on the secular decline.
A cohort study was conducted of all individuals aged ≥65 years in Denmark from 2005 through 2018 (N = 1,757,168). Annual incidence rates of dementia and population attributable risks of the four factors were calculated and birth cohort trends were examined.
The incidence of dementia declined by 22.5% in men and 34.2% in women from 2005 through 2018. Population attributable risks of lower education, lower wealth, and stroke likewise declined. Independent of these improvements, the incidence of dementia fell across successive birth cohorts.
Most of the observed plasticity in late-onset dementia is associated with a risk decline across successive birth cohorts that is independent of improvements in traditional risk factors.","['Denmark', 'dementia', 'incidence', 'risk factors', 'time trends']",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2021-09-28,"[{'lastname': 'Hegelund', 'firstname': 'Emilie R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nStatistics Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Mehta', 'firstname': 'Amar J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nStatistics Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Mortensen', 'firstname': 'Laust H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nStatistics Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Westendorp', 'firstname': 'Rudi G J', 'initials': 'RGJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nStatistics Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]",,,"The incidence of dementia declined by 22.5% in men and 34.2% in women from 2005 through 2018.

22640548",Prevalence and incidence of young onset dementia and associations with comorbidities: A study of data from the French national health data system.,"Dementia onset in those aged <65 years (young onset dementia, YOD) has dramatic individual and societal consequences. In the context of population aging, data on YOD are of major importance to anticipate needs for planning and allocation of health and social resources. Few studies have provided precise frequency estimates of YOD. The aim of this study is to provide YOD prevalence and incidence estimates in France and to study the contribution of comorbidities to YOD incidence.
Using data from the French national health data system (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS) for 76% of the French population aged 40 to 64 years in 2016 (n = 16,665,795), we identified all persons with dementia based on at least 1 of 3 criteria: anti-Alzheimer drugs claims, hospitalization with the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) dementia codes (F00 to F03, G30, G31.0, G31.1, or F05.1), or registration for free healthcare for dementia. We estimated prevalence rate (PR) and incidence rate (IR) and estimated the association of comorbidities with incident YOD. Sex differences were investigated. We identified 18,466 (PRstandardized = 109.7/100,000) and 4,074 incident (IRstandardized = 24.4/100,000 person-years) persons with prevalent and incident YOD, respectively. PR and IR sharply increased with age. Age-adjusted PR and IR were 33% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 29 to 37) and 39% (95% CI = 31 to 48) higher in men than women (p < 0.001 both for PR and IR). Cardio- and cerebrovascular, neurological, psychiatric diseases, and traumatic brain injury prevalence were associated with incident YOD (age- and sex-adjusted p-values <0.001 for all comorbidities examined, except p = 0.109 for antihypertensive drug therapy). Adjustment for all comorbidities explained more than 55% of the sex difference in YOD incidence. The lack of information regarding dementia subtypes is the main limitation of this study.
We estimated that there were approximately 24,000 and approximately 5,300 persons with prevalent and incident YOD, respectively, in France in 2016. The higher YOD frequency in men may be partly explained by higher prevalence of cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases, substance abuse disorders, and traumatic brain injury and warrants further investigation.",[],PLoS medicine,2021-09-24,"[{'lastname': 'Carcaillon-Bentata', 'firstname': 'Laure', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Santé publique France, Saint-Maurice, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Quintin', 'firstname': 'Cécile', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Santé publique France, Saint-Maurice, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Boussac-Zarebska', 'firstname': 'Marjorie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Santé publique France, Saint-Maurice, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Elbaz', 'firstname': 'Alexis', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Santé publique France, Saint-Maurice, France.\nUniversité Paris-Saclay, Univ.

29528368",Cognitive Dispersion Predicts Grip Strength Trajectories in Men but not Women in a Sample of the Oldest Old Without Dementia.,"Grip strength is a reliable marker of biological vitality and it typically demonstrates an expected decline in older adults. According to the common-cause hypothesis, there is also a significant association between cognitive and physical function in older adults. Some specific cognitive functions have been shown to be associated with grip strength trajectories with most research solely focused on cutoff points or mean cognitive performance. In the present study, we examine whether a measure of cognitive dispersion might be more informative. We therefore used an index that quantifies dispersion in cognitive scores across multiple cognitive tests, shown to be associated with detrimental outcomes in older adults.
Using repeated grip strength measures from men and women aged 80 and older, free of dementia in the OCTO-Twin study, we estimated aging-related grip strength trajectories. We examined the association of cognitive dispersion and mean cognitive function with grip strength level and aging-related rate of change, accounting for known risk factors.
Cognitive dispersion was associated with grip strength trajectories in men and the association varied by mean cognitive performance, whereas we found no association in women.
Our results provide evidence of a sex-specific vitality association between cognitive dispersion and aging-related trajectories of grip strength. Our results support the call for integration of sex and gender in health promotion and intervention research.","['Cognition', 'Epidemiology', 'Frailty', 'Longevity', 'Psychometrics']",Innovation in aging,2021-09-23,"[{'lastname': 'Watermeyer', 'firstname': 'Tamlyn', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.\nDepartment of Psychology, Faculty of Health & Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Massa', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Estadistica, Universidad de la Republica del Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay.'}, {'lastname': 'Goerdten', 'firstname': 'Jantje', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiological Methods and Etiological Research, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology-BIPS, Bremen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stirland', 'firstname': 'Lucy', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Johansson', 'firstname': 'Boo', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology & Centre for Ageing and Health (AgeCap), University of Gothenburg, Goethenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Muniz-Terrera', 'firstname': 'Graciela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}]",,,"Cognitive dispersion was associated with grip strength trajectories in men and the association varied by mean cognitive performance, whereas we found no association in women.",© The Author(s) 2021.

31219687",Lifestyle and the aging brain: interactive effects of modifiable lifestyle behaviors and cognitive ability in men from midlife to old age.,"We examined the influence of lifestyle on brain aging after nearly 30 years, and tested the hypothesis that young adult general cognitive ability (GCA) would moderate these effects. In the community-dwelling Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA), 431 largely non-Hispanic white men completed a test of GCA at mean age 20. We created a modifiable lifestyle behavior composite from data collected at mean age 40. During VETSA, MRI-based measures at mean age 68 included predicted brain age difference (PBAD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain signature, and abnormal white matter scores. There were significant main effects of young adult GCA and lifestyle on PBAD and the AD signature (ps ≤ 0.012), and a GCA-by-lifestyle interaction on both (ps ≤ 0.006). Regardless of GCA level, having more favorable lifestyle behaviors predicted less advanced brain age and less AD-like brain aging. Unfavorable lifestyles predicted advanced brain aging in those with lower age 20 GCA, but did not affect brain aging in those with higher age 20 GCA. Targeting early lifestyle modification may promote dementia risk reduction, especially among lower reserve individuals.","[""Alzheimer's disease brain signature"", 'Brain aging', 'Cognitive reserve', 'General cognitive ability', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Modifiable lifestyle behavior', 'White matter abnormalities']",Neurobiology of aging,2021-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Franz', 'firstname': 'Carol E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA; Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.

COVID-19 pandemic through 13 March 2021.
YLLs and QALYs lost per 10 000 persons in the population. The estimates account for the age, sex, and race/ethnicity of decedents, along with obesity, smoking behavior, lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, hypertension, dementia, and nursing home residence.
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in 6.62 million QALYs lost (9.08 million YLLs) through 13 March 2021, with 3.6 million (54%) lost by those aged 25 to 64 years. The greatest toll was on Black and Hispanic communities, especially among men aged 65 years or older, who lost 1138 and 1371 QALYs, respectively, per 10 000 persons. Absent the pandemic, 38% of decedents would have had average or above-average life expectancies for their subgroup defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Accounting for uncertainty in risk factors for death from COVID-19 yielded similar results.
Estimates may vary depending on assumptions about mortality and quality-of-life projections.
Beyond excess deaths alone, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed a greater life expectancy burden on persons aged 25 to 64 years, including those with average or above-average life expectancies, and a disproportionate burden on Black and Hispanic communities.

31122189",Certain dietary patterns are associated with GLIM criteria among Chinese community-dwelling older adults: a cross-sectional analysis.,"Disease-related malnutrition is prevalent among older adults; therefore, identifying the modifiable risk factors in the diet is essential for the prevention and management of disease-related malnutrition. The present study examined the cross-sectional association between dietary patterns and malnutrition in Chinese community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 years in Hong Kong. Dietary patterns, including Diet Quality Index International (DQI-I), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the Mediterranean Diet Score, 'vegetable-fruit' pattern, 'snack-drink-milk product' pattern and 'meat-fish' pattern, were estimated and generated from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Malnutrition was classified according to the modified Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria based on two phenotypic components (low body mass index and reduced muscle mass) and one aetiologic component (inflammation/disease burden). The association between the tertile or level of adherence of each dietary pattern and modified GLIM criteria was analysed using adjusted binary logistic regression models. Data of 3694 participants were available (49 % men). Malnutrition was present in 397 participants (10⋅7 %). In men, a higher DQI-I score, a higher 'vegetable-fruit' pattern score and a lower 'meat-fish' pattern score were associated with a lower risk of malnutrition. In women, higher adherence to the DASH diet was associated with a lower risk of malnutrition. After the Bonferroni correction, the association remained statistically significant only in men for the DQI-I score. To conclude, a higher DQI-I score was associated with a lower risk of malnutrition in Chinese older men. Nutritional strategies for the prevention and management of malnutrition could potentially be targeted on dietary quality.","['Aged', 'BMI, body mass index', 'CI, confidence intervals', 'CSID, Community Screening Instrument for Dementia', 'Chinese', 'DASH, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension', 'DQI-I, Dietary Quality Index International', 'Diet quality', 'Dietary patterns', 'GLIM criteria', 'GLIM, Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition', 'MDS, Mediterranean Diet Score', 'Malnutrition', 'OR, odds ratio', 'PASE, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly', 'hsCRP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein']",Journal of nutritional science,2021-09-17,"[{'lastname': 'Yeung', 'firstname': 'Suey S Y', 'initials': 'SSY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Ruth S M', 'initials': 'RSM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jenny S W', 'initials': 'JSW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.\nDepartment of Medicine, Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Hong Kong, China.\nDepartment of Medicine and Geriatrics, Tai Po Hospital, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Woo', 'firstname': 'Jean', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.\nCentre for Nutritional Studies, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.'}]",,,,© The Author(s) 2021.,10.1017/jns.2021.64,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df449720>,,,,,,
336,34488150,Psychosocial stressors at work and inflammatory biomarkers: PROspective Quebec Study on Work and Health.,"Chronic low-grade inflammation has been associated with high risk of several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression, and dementia. As low-grade inflammation could be present long before the apparition of the disease, identifying modifiable risk factors could allow to act upstream. Psychosocial stressors at work have been suggested as modifiable risk factors of low-grade inflammation, but few longitudinal studies have evaluated the association between these stressors and inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
This longitudinal study evaluate the associations between exposure to psychosocial stressors at work and CRP and IL-6, separately and combined into an inflammatory index.
Data came from a cohort of 9188 white-collar workers recruited in 1991-1993 (T1) and followed-up after 8 (T2, 1999-2000) and 24 (T3, 2015-2018) years. Participants included in this study were randomly selected at T3 for serum biomarkers studies (n = 2557). CRP and IL-6 were measured using standardized protocols. Psychosocial stressors at work were assessed at T2 according to recognized models: Karasek's Demand-Control-Support model and Siegrist's Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model, using validated questionnaires. High job strain was defined by an exposure to high psychological demand combined with low job control, and iso-strain was defined by an exposure to high job strain combined with low social support at work. ERI was defined by an imbalance between psychological demand and social, economic, and organizational reward. Several covariates were considered including sociodemographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle characteristics, and comorbidities. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the highest quartile of CRP, IL-6 and inflammatory index at T3 according to psychosocial stressors at work measured at T2 were calculated using generalized estimating equations. Multiple imputation and inverse probability of censoring weighting were done.
In men, an association was observed between exposure to iso-strain and the inflammatory index (PR of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.06;1.90)), mainly among men aged less than 65 years (PR of 2.00 (95% CI: 1.37;2.92)). In this same age group, associations with inflammatory biomarkers were also observed among men with exposure to ERI, and among women with exposure to low reward at work or moderate social support at work.
These results suggest that psychosocial stressors at work may increase low-grade inflammation. However, further studies are needed to corroborate these results and to clarify the potential differences between men and women. As these stressors are frequent and modifiable, their reduction is important for public health and could play a role in the primary prevention of chronic diseases.","['CRP', 'Effort-reward imbalance', 'IL-6', 'Inflammatory biomarkers', 'Job strain', 'Low-grade inflammation']",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Duchaine', 'firstname': 'Caroline S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': ""CHU de Québec-Laval University Research Center, 1050 Chemin Ste-Foy, Quebec City, QC G1S 4L8, Canada; Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, 1050 ave de la Médecine, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada; Centre d'excellence sur le vieillissement de Québec (CEVQ), 1050 Chemin Ste-Foy, Quebec City, QC G1S 4L8, Canada; VITAM, Centre de recherche en santé durable, 2525 chemin de la Canardière, Quebec City, QC G1J 0A4, Canada; Institut sur le vieillissement et la participation sociale des aînés, Université Laval, 1050 Chemin Ste-Foy, Quebec City, QC G1S 4L8, Canada.

337,34487048,Associations of Diet Quality with Midlife Brain Volume: Findings from the UK Biobank Cohort Study.,"Higher quality diets may be related to lower dementia rates. Midlife is emerging as a critical life stage for a number of dementia risk factors.
This study examines whether diet quality is related to brain structure during midlife, and if this differs by sex.
This study used data from 19184 UK Biobank participants aged 40-65 years. Diet quality was assessed using three dietary indices including the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Healthy Diet Score (HDS), and Recommended Food Score (RFS). MRI brain measures included total, grey, white and hippocampal volume. Linear regression examined associations between diet quality and brain volume, controlling for potential confounders.
Better quality diet across all indices was significantly related to larger grey matter volume: MDS β= 429.7 (95%CI: 65.2, 794.2); HDS β= 700.1 (348.0, 1052.1); and RFS β= 317.1 (106.8, 527.3). Higher diet scores were associated with greater total volume: HDS β= 879.32 (286.13, 1472.50); RFS β= 563.37 (209.10, 917.65); and white matter volume: RFS β= 246.31 (20.56, 472.05), with the exception of Mediterranean diet adherence. Healthy eating guidelines and dietary variety associations with total and grey matter volume were more prominent in men.
Findings suggest that diet quality is associated with brain structure during midlife, potentially decades prior to the onset of dementia.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Mediterranean diet', 'brain volume', 'dementia', 'healthy diet']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Macpherson', 'firstname': 'Helen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, Geelong, Australia, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN), School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Burwood, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McNaughton', 'firstname': 'Sarah A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, Geelong, Australia, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN), School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Burwood, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Lamb', 'firstname': 'Karen E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Milte', 'firstname': 'Catherine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Deakin University, Geelong, Australia, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN), School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Burwood, VIC, Australia.'}]",,"Findings suggest that diet quality is associated with brain structure during midlife, potentially decades prior to the onset of dementia.","Better quality diet across all indices was significantly related to larger grey matter volume: MDS β= 429.7 (95%CI: 65.2, 794.2); HDS β= 700.1 (348.0, 1052.1); and RFS β= 317.1 (106.8, 527.3).

338,34454958,Dengue and dementia risk: A nationwide longitudinal study.,"Accumulating evidence suggests neurological manifestations after dengue infection. However, the relationship between dengue and long-term neurocognitive sequel remains unclear.
We recruited 816 patients with dengue and 8,160 controls between 1997 and 2012 using data from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and followed them up until the end of 2013. Individuals who exhibited any type of dementia were identified during the follow-up period. Cox regression analyses were performed with adjustments for demographic data and medical and mental comorbidities (cerebrovascular diseases, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, depression, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder). The E-value for the causality of the evidence was calculated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to exclude patients with prodromal dementia.
Patients with dengue were more likely to develop dementia (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-3.28), Alzheimer's disease (HR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.08-8.45), and unspecified dementia (HR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.43-3.53), but not vascular dementia compared to controls during the follow-up period. Sensitivity analyses after exclusion of the observation period over the first three years or first five years and after exclusion of patients' enrollment before 2010 or 2008 showed consistent findings. The E-values for the HR (range 3.62-5.51) supported the association between dengue and subsequent dementia among the whole population, men, and women.
The risk of dementia was 2.23-fold higher in patients diagnosed with dengue during the follow-up period than in the controls.

32454996",From Menopause to Neurodegeneration-Molecular Basis and Potential Therapy.,"The impacts of menopause on neurodegenerative diseases, especially the changes in steroid hormones, have been well described in cell models, animal models, and humans. However, the therapeutic effects of hormone replacement therapy on postmenopausal women with neurodegenerative diseases remain controversial. The steroid hormones, steroid hormone receptors, and downstream signal pathways in the brain change with aging and contribute to disease progression. Estrogen and progesterone are two steroid hormones which decline in circulation and the brain during menopause. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which plays an import role in neuroprotection, is rapidly decreased in serum after menopause. Here, we summarize the actions of estrogen, progesterone, and IGF-1 and their signaling pathways in the brain. Since the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is higher in women than in men, the associations of steroid hormone changes and AD are emphasized. The signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms for how steroid hormones and IGF-1 provide neuroprotection are also addressed. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of potential estrogen modulation on N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) are also addressed. We provide the viewpoint of why hormone therapy has inconclusive results based on signaling pathways considering their complex response to aging and hormone treatments. Nonetheless, while diagnosable AD may not be treatable by hormone therapy, its preceding stage of mild cognitive impairment may very well be treatable by hormone therapy.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'IGF-1', 'NMDAR', 'estrogen', 'menopause', 'neurodegenerative disease']",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Yu-Jung', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Graduate Institute of Rehabilitation Science, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Rehabilitation, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Chieh-Hsin', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.\nKaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.\nSchool of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lane', 'firstname': 'Hsien-Yuan', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Psychiatry & Brain Disease Research Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Psychology, College of Medical and Health Sciences, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijms22168654

26294005",Factors Affecting Rapid Cognitive Decline in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Longitudinal Follow-Up Study.,"We investigated the preventive and risk factors of rapid cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD), we enrolled patients with AD aged over 65 years between 1 January 2001 and 30 May 2019, and followed up for at least two years. Rapid cognitive decline was defined by a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score decline of ≥4 in 2 years. A longer prescription of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) was defined as 22 months based on the median treatment duration of the cohorts. The Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for age, sex, medication, and physical comorbidities was used to examine the candidate risk and protective factors. We analyzed data from 3846 patients with AD (1503 men, 2343 women) with a mean age and percentage of females of 77.8 ± 6.2 years and 60.9%, respectively. The mean duration of patients with AD receiving AChEIs was 658.7 ± 21.9 days. In general, 310 patients with AD showed a rapid cognitive decline, accounting for 8.1%. Treatment of a consecutive AChEI prescription for >22 months in patients with AD was a protective factor against rapid cognitive decline (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.33-0.52, ","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'acetylcholinesterase inhibitors', 'moderators', 'predictor', 'rapid cognitive decline']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Pan', 'firstname': 'Chih-Chuan', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chu', 'firstname': 'Che-Sheng', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.\nCenter for Geriatric and Gerontology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.\nNon-Invasive Neuromodulation Consortium for Mental Disorders, Society of Psychophysiology, Taipei 114, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Chien-Liang', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chuang', 'firstname': 'Yao-Chung', 'initials': 'YC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Neurology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Nai-Ching', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph18168576

29740780",Associations of the Lifestyle for Brain Health Index With Structural Brain Changes and Cognition: Results From the Maastricht Study.,"Observational research has shown that a substantial proportion of all dementia cases worldwide are attributable to modifiable risk factors. Dementia risk scores might be useful to identify high-risk individuals and monitor treatment adherence. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a dementia risk score, the Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA) index, is associated with MRI markers and cognitive functioning/impairment in the general population.
Cross-sectional data were used from the observational population-based cohort of The Maastricht Study. The weighted compound score of LIBRA (including 12 dementia risk and protective factors, e.g., hypertension, physical inactivity) was calculated, with higher scores indicating higher dementia risk. Standardized volumes of white matter, gray matter, and CSF (as proxy for general brain atrophy), white matter hyperintensities, and presence of cerebral small vessel disease were derived from 3T MRI. Cognitive functioning was tested in 3 domains: memory, information processing speed, and executive function and attention. Values ≤1.5 SDs below the average were defined as cognitive impairment. Multiple regression analyses and structural equation modeling were used, adjusted for age, sex, education, intracranial volume, and type 2 diabetes.
Participants (n = 4,164; mean age 59 years; 49.7% men) with higher LIBRA scores (mean 1.19, range -2.7 to 9.2), denoting higher dementia risk, had higher volumes of white matter hyperintensities (β = 0.051, 
Higher health- and lifestyle-based dementia risk is associated with markers of general brain atrophy, cerebrovascular pathology, and worse cognition, suggesting that LIBRA meaningfully summarizes individual lifestyle-related brain health. Improving LIBRA factors on an individual level might improve population brain health. Sex differences in lifestyle-related pathology and cognition need to be further explored.
This study provides Class II evidence that higher LIBRA scores are significantly associated with lower scores in some cognitive domains and a higher risk of cognitive impairment.",[],Neurology,2021-08-27,"[{'lastname': 'Heger', 'firstname': 'Irene S', 'initials': 'IS', 'affiliation': 'From the School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (I.S.H., K.D., M.T.S., J.F.A.J., F.R.J.V., M.P.J.v.B., S.K.), Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology (I.S.H., K.D., F.R.J.V., M.P.J.v.B., S.K.), School for Cardiovascular Diseases (M.T.S., C.D.A.S., P.C.D., C.J.H.v.d.K., S.J.P.M.E.), Care and Public Health Research Institute (A.K.), Department of Social Medicine (A.K.), and Department of Epidemiology (S.J.P.M.E.), Maastricht University;

15809269",Sex-Specific Association of the X Chromosome With Cognitive Change and Tau Pathology in Aging and Alzheimer Disease.,"The X chromosome represents 5% of the human genome in women and men, and its influence on cognitive aging and Alzheimer disease (AD) is largely unknown.
To determine whether the X chromosome is associated with sex-specific cognitive change and tau pathology in aging and AD.
This study examined differential gene expression profiling of the X chromosome from an RNA sequencing data set of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex obtained from autopsied, elderly individuals enrolled in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project joint cohorts. Samples were collected from the cohort study with enrollment from 1994 to 2017. Data were last analyzed in May 2021.
The main analysis examined whether X chromosome gene expression measured by RNA sequencing of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with cognitive change during aging and AD, independent of AD pathology and at the transcriptome-wide level in women and men. Whether X chromosome gene expression was associated with neurofibrillary tangle burden, a measure of tau pathology that influences cognition, in women and men was also explored.
Samples for RNA sequencing of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were obtained from 508 individuals (mean [SD] age at death, 88.4 [6.6] years; 315 [62.0%] were female; 197 [38.8%] had clinical diagnosis of AD at death; 293 [58.2%] had pathological diagnosis of AD at death) enrolled in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project joint cohorts and were followed up annually for a mean (SD) of 6.3 (3.9) years. X chromosome gene expression (29 genes), adjusted for age at death, education, and AD pathology, was significantly associated with cognitive change at the genome-wide level in women but not men. In the majority of identified X genes (19 genes), increased expression was associated with slower cognitive decline in women. In contrast with cognition, X chromosome gene expression (3 genes), adjusted for age at death and education, was associated with neuropathological tau burden at the genome-wide level in men but not women.
In this study, the X chromosome was associated with cognitive trajectories and neuropathological tau burden in aging and AD in a sex-specific manner. This is important because specific X chromosome factors could contribute risk or resilience to biological pathways of aging and AD in women, men, or both.",[],JAMA neurology,2021-08-24,"[{'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Emily J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.\nBiomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Solsberg', 'firstname': 'Caroline W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.\nPharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenetics Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.\nBakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.\nMemory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'White', 'firstname': 'Charles C', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': ""Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nCenter for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.""}, {'lastname': 'Miñones-Moyano', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Sirota', 'firstname': 'Marina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Chibnik', 'firstname': 'Lori', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Biostatistics Center, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Harvard T.

32161813",Sex Difference in the Relation Between Marital Status and Dementia Risk in Two Population-Based Cohorts.,"The modifying effect of sex on the relation between marital status and dementia has yet to be determined.
To examine if sex modifies the association between marital status and incident dementia.
Population-based samples from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA, N = 3,471) and the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study (H70-study, N = 913) were used. A multiplicative interaction term was used to analyze the modifying effect of sex on the relation between marital status (married versus not married) and incident dementia using Cox regression models. Further, risk of dementia by marital status was also evaluated in models separated by sex.
In the MCSA, there was an interaction between marital status and sex in relation to dementia (p = 0.015). In contrast, in the H70-study, no significant interaction was observed (p = 0.28). Nevertheless, in both studies, not married men had increased risk of dementia compared to married men in models adjusted for age, education, and number of children (H70-study: 1.99; 1.06-3.76, MCSA: 1.43; 1.08-1.89). Associations remained similar after additional adjustment for depression, BMI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (H70-study: 2.00; 1.05-3.82, MCSA: 1.32; 0.99-1.76). Further, no significant association was observed between marital status and dementia in women (H70-study: 1.24; 0.82-1.89, MCSA: 0.82; 0.64-1.04).
Sex had a modifying effect on the association between marital status and incident dementia. In analyses separated by sex, not married men had an increased risk of dementia compared to married men, while no significant association was observed between marital status and risk of dementia in women.","['Dementia', 'epidemiology', 'marital status', 'risk factors', 'sex differences']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-08-24,"[{'lastname': 'Najar', 'firstname': 'Jenna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Centre for Ageing and Health (AGECAP) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.\nRegion Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Psychiatry, Cognition and Old Age Psychiatry Clinic, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Aakre', 'firstname': 'Jeremiah A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vassilaki', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wetterberg', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Centre for Ageing and Health (AGECAP) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Rydén', 'firstname': 'Lina', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Centre for Ageing and Health (AGECAP) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.\nRegion Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Psychiatry, Cognition and Old Age Psychiatry Clinic, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Zettergren', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Centre for Ageing and Health (AGECAP) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Skoog', 'firstname': 'Ingmar', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Centre for Ageing and Health (AGECAP) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.\nRegion Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Psychiatry, Cognition and Old Age Psychiatry Clinic, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Jack', 'firstname': 'Clifford R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Knopman', 'firstname': 'David S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Petersen', 'firstname': 'Ronald C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kern', 'firstname': 'Silke', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Centre for Ageing and Health (AGECAP) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.\nRegion Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Psychiatry, Cognition and Old Age Psychiatry Clinic, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Mielke', 'firstname': 'Michelle M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\nDepartment of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}]",,"Sex had a modifying effect on the association between marital status and incident dementia.

345,34419571,Development of risk prediction models for incident frailty and their performance evaluation.,"There is currently no tool to predict incident frailty despite various frailty assessment tools. This study aimed to develop risk prediction models for incident frailty and evaluated their performance on discrimination, calibration, and internal validity. This 2-year follow-up study used data from 5076 non-frail older adults (51% women) living in Tokyo at baseline. We used the Kaigo-Yobo checklist, a standardised assessment instrument, to determine frailty. Twenty questionnaire-based variables that include sociodemographic, medical, behavioural, and subjective factors were entered into binary logistic regression analysis with stepwise backward elimination (p < 0.1 for retention in the model). Discrimination and calibration were assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, respectively. For the assessment of internal validity, we used a 5-fold cross-validation method and calculated the mean AUC. At the follow-up survey, 15.0% of men and 10.2% of women were frail. The frailty risk prediction model was composed of 10 variables for men and 11 for women. AUC of the model was 0.71 in men and 0.72 in women. The P-value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in both models was more than 0.05. For internal validity, the mean AUC was 0.71 in men and 0.72 in women. Probability of incident frailty rose with an increasing risk score that was calculated from the developed models. These results demonstrated that the developed models enable the identification of non-frail older adults at high risk of incident frailty, which could help to implement preventive approaches in community settings.","['Community settings', 'Frail', 'Risk factor', 'Risk score', 'Validation']",Preventive medicine,2021-08-23,"[{'lastname': 'Abe', 'firstname': 'Takumi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, 35-2 Sakae, Itabashi, Tokyo 173-0015, Japan; Centre for Urban Transitions, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC 3122, Australia.

30052812",Association between dementia and hepatitis B and C virus infection.,"Several viral infections are known to increase the risk of dementia through brain cell damage and systemic infection. The association between hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infections and dementia was evaluated using a national sample cohort from South Korea. Using the national cohort study from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we extracted data for patients with HBV or HCV infection and for matched control participants. The controls were matched to the patients according to age, sex, income, region of residence, and past medical histories. The incidence of HCV infection was higher in the dementia group (1.0% [113/11,228]) than in the control group (0.8% [364/44,912], P = .043). However, there was no difference in the incidence of HBV infection in the dementia and control groups. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for HCV infection was 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.54, P = .043) in the dementia group. According to the subgroup analysis by sex, the adjusted ORs for HCV infection were 1.04 (95% CI = 072-1.49, P = .851) in men and 1.38 (95% CI = 1.06-1.79, P = .016) in women.

347,34388948,Socioeconomic Position and Late-Onset Dementia: A Nationwide Register-Based Study.,"Previous research on the association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and dementia has not sufficiently accounted for the complex relationship between education and occupation. We investigated the independent and joint effects of educational attainment and occupation-based SEP on dementia.
We used register-based information about educational attainment, occupation-based SEP, and dementia from 1,210,720 individuals. Information about cognitive ability at conscription was available for a subsample of men.
When mutually adjusted, lower educational attainment and occupation-based SEP were associated with higher dementia risk in a dose-response manner. Higher occupation-based SEP partly mitigated the higher dementia risk associated with lower educational attainment.

24060442",Factors Associated With Adherence to Osteoporosis Medications Among Male Veterans.,"Risk factors for nonadherence to osteoporosis medication have been well described for cohorts of women with osteoporosis, but little is known about predictors or mediators of nonadherence in men. We conducted a secondary analysis of a national cohort of male veterans to explore factors associated with nonadherence to osteoporosis medications. We included veterans with a prescription for an oral bisphosphonate or calcitonin between 2000 and 2010. We identified demographic, comorbid, and fracture-related risk factors by their International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate their association with adherence. Adherence was measured by medication possession ratio (MPR) over 5 years, starting at the time of their first prescription during the study period and censoring at death or end of study period. Of 135,306 men identified with at least one prescription for an osteoporosis medication during the study period, 90,406 (67%) were nonadherent (MPR < 0.80). The median duration of therapy was 3.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.7-5.0). In the fully adjusted model, the odds of adherence were lower in those aged <65 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.89), with no copay (OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.76-0.80), dementia (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.83-0.91), anxiety/depression (OR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.90-0.95), tobacco use (OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.89-0.94), alcohol abuse (OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.89-0.94), rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.97), and on androgen deprivation therapy (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.83-0.95). The odds of adherence were higher in whites (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.11-1.17), with a prior screening colonoscopy (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.09-1.14), on alendronate versus other agents (OR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.55-1.67), with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.12-1.17), on glucocorticoids (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.02-1.14), and with recent fracture (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10). In conclusion, adherence to oral bisphosphonates/calcitonin is poor, with particular subgroups at greatest risk. These findings may help tailor approaches for supporting adherence in men prescribed osteoporosis medications. © 2021 The Authors.

33030307",Differences in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Pathology Among African American and Hispanic Women: A Qualitative Literature Review of Biomarker Studies.,"The population of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is growing larger and more diverse. Prevalence of ADRD is higher in African American (AA) and Hispanic populations relative to non-Hispanic whites (nHW), with larger differences for women compared to men of the same race. Given the public health importance of this issue, we sought to determine if AA and Hispanic women exhibit worse ADRD pathology compared to men of the same race and nHW women. We hypothesized that such differences may explain the discrepancy in ADRD prevalence.
We evaluated 932 articles that measured at least one of the following biomarkers of ADRD pathology 
We included 26 articles (Aß = 9, tau = 6, neurodegeneration = 16, cSVD = 18), with seven including sex-by-race comparisons. Studies differed by sampling source (e.g., clinic or population), multivariable analytical approach (e.g., adjusted for risk factors for AD), and cognitive status of participants. Aß burden did not differ by race or sex. Tau differed by race (AA < nHW), and by sex (women > men). Both severity of neurodegeneration and cSVD differed by race (AA > nHW; Hispanics < nHW) and sex (women < men). Among the studies that tested sex-by-race interactions, results were not significant.
Few studies have examined the burden of ADRD pathology by both race and sex. The higher prevalence of ADRD in women compared to men of the same race may be due to both higher tau load and more vulnerability to cognitive decline in the presence of similar Aß and cSVD burden. AA women may also exhibit more neurodegeneration and cSVD relative to nHW populations. Studies suggest that between-group differences in ADRD pathology are complex, but they are too sparse to completely explain why minority women have the highest ADRD prevalence. Future work should recruit diverse cohorts, compare ADRD biomarkers by both race and sex, and collect relevant risk factor and cognitive data.","['African American', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Hispanic', 'amyloid', 'cerebral small vessel disease', 'neurodegeneration', 'sex differences', 'tau']",Frontiers in systems neuroscience,2021-08-10,"[{'lastname': 'Royse', 'firstname': 'Sarah K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Cohen', 'firstname': 'Ann D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Snitz', 'firstname': 'Beth E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosano', 'firstname': 'Caterina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.'}]",,"Few studies have examined the burden of ADRD pathology by both race and sex.

However, little is known regarding the gender-specific longitudinal association between social engagement and cognition among middle-aged and older adults. Using data from a nationally representative sample of 2707 men and 5196 women from the Korean longitudinal study of aging, we examined the gender-specific association between social activity and cognitive function. Results from the generalized estimating equation model showed that compared to individuals with consistent social engagement (religious, senior center, sport, reunion, voluntary, political), individuals with inconsistent engagement had lower cognitive function. Transitioning from engagement to non-engagement was associated with lower cognitive function among men only. Not being part of a senior center was associated with decreased cognitive function among both genders, while not being part of a religious group was significant for women only. While marital status was a significant predictor of cognitive ability for women, depression was a significant predictor for men. These findings have implications for policy-makers as interventions targeting improved cognitive function among middle-aged and older adults may be more effective when gender-specific predictors are taken into consideration.",[],Scientific reports,2021-08-07,"[{'lastname': 'Oh', 'firstname': 'Sarah Soyeon', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Mo-Im Kim Nursing Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Nursing, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Eunhee', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Mo-Im Kim Nursing Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Nursing, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Bada', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Mo-Im Kim Nursing Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Nursing, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.

11378002","Initiation of domiciliary care and nursing home admission following first hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cancer.","Patients with chronic diseases are at higher risk of requiring domiciliary and nursing home care, but how different chronic diseases compare in terms of risk is not known. We examined initiation of domiciliary care and nursing home admission among patients with heart failure (HF), stroke, COPD and cancer.
Patients with a first-time hospitalization for HF, stroke, COPD or cancer from 2008-2016 were identified. Patients were matched on age and sex and followed for five years.
111,144 patients, 27,786 with each disease, were identified. The median age was 69 years and two thirds of the patients were men.

353,34332836,Editor's Choice - Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Sex Specific Differences in Adverse Events After Open and Endovascular Intact Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: Consistently Worse Outcomes for Women.,"Previously, reports have shown that women experience a higher mortality rate than men after elective open (OAR) and endovascular (EVAR) repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). With recent improvements in overall AAA repair outcomes, this study aimed to identify whether sex specific disparity has been ameliorated by modern practice, and to define sex specific differences in peri- and post-operative complications and pre-operative status; factors which may contribute to poor outcome.
This was a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of sex specific differences in 30 day mortality and complications conducted according to PRISMA guidance (Prospero registration CRD42020176398). Papers with ≥ 50 women, reporting sex specific outcomes, following intact primary AAA repair, from 2000 to 2020 worldwide were included; with separate analyses for EVAR and OAR. Data sources were Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases 2005 - 2020 searched using ProQuest Dialog.
Twenty-six studies (371 215 men, 65 465 women) were included. Meta-analysis and meta-regression indicated that sex specific odds ratios (ORs) for 30 day mortality were unchanged from 2000 to 2020. Mortality risk was higher in women for OAR and more so for EVAR (OR [95% CI] 1.49 [1.37 - 1.61]; 1.86 [1.59 - 2.17], respectively) and this remained following multivariable risk adjustment. Transfusion, pulmonary complications, and bowel ischaemia were more common in women after OAR and EVAR (OAR: ORs 1.81 [1.60 - 2.04], 1.40 [1.28 - 1.53], 1.54 [1.36 - 1.75]; EVAR: ORs 2.18 [2.08 - 2.29] 1.44 [1.17 - 1.77], 1.99 [1.51 - 2.62], respectively). Arterial injury, limb ischaemia, renal and cardiac complications were more common in women after EVAR (ORs 3.02 [1.62 - 5.65], 2.13 [1.48 - 3.06], 1.46 [1.22 - 1.72] and 1.19 [1.03 - 1.37], respectively); the latter was associated with greater mortality risk on meta-regression.
Increased mortality risk for women following AAA repair remains. Women had a higher incidence of transfusion, pulmonary and bowel complications after EVAR and OAR. Higher mortality risk ratios for EVAR may result from cardiac complications, additional arterial injury, and embolisation, leading to renal and limb ischaemia. These findings indicate possible causes for observed outcome disparities and targets for quality improvement.","['Abdominal aortic aneurysm', 'Endovascular aneurysm repair', 'Mortality', 'Postoperative outcomes', 'Sex']",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,2021-08-02,"[{'lastname': 'Pouncey', 'firstname': 'Anna L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, UK.

31588697",Exploring the associations between cardiovascular health measured with the CANHEART model and early cognitive impairment in a middle-aged population in Korea.,"Both cardiovascular health (CVH) and inflammation are associated with cognition, and inflammation is also associated with CVH. However, limited information has been reported on these factors in the Korean population. The objective of our study was to investigate the influence of inflammation on the association between CVH and cognition using a cross-sectional design.
Data were obtained from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Etiology Research Center baseline study. Participants who completed fasting serum analysis, questionnaires, and cognitive function tests were included in the analysis, whereas those with a history of autoimmune disease were excluded. The CVH in Ambulatory Care Research Team health index metrics, including smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, obesity, history of hypertension, and diabetes, were used to assess CVH. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Estimation for Dementia Screening. Inflammatory status was assessed based on a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test.
Among 2,622 total participants (mean age, 57.2 years; 1,792 women), 13%, 58%, and 29% had poor, intermediate, and ideal CVH, respectively. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CVH was significantly associated with cognitive function only in women. A stratified analysis showed that cognitive impairment due to CVH was not associated with hs-CRP levels. When the same analyses were conducted for each CVH component, the only component affecting the association was hypertension history in men.
CVH is not significantly associated with cognitive decline in the middle-aged Korean population. Inflammation did not play a significant modifying role in this relationship.","['Cardiovascular diseases', 'Cognitive dysfunction', 'Inflammation', 'Korea']",Epidemiology and health,2021-07-23,"[{'lastname': 'Jeon', 'firstname': 'Ye Jin', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Yonsei University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Ji Heon', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Hyeon Chang', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Yonsei University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.\nDepartment of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Sun Jae', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Yonsei University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.\nDepartment of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}]",,,"Among 2,622 total participants (mean age, 57.2 years; 1,792 women), 13%, 58%, and 29% had poor, intermediate, and ideal CVH, respectively.

19886379",Preventing Falls and Malnutrition among Older Adults in Municipal Residential Care in Sweden: A Registry Study.,"Older adults in municipal residential care are among the most vulnerable and in need of most care. The prevalence of negative events, such as falls and malnutrition, is increased among these older adults. The need for strategies to prevent falls and malnutrition is emphasized in guidelines and systematic, individualized risk assessments are prerequisites for adequate interventions.
The overall purpose of this study was to investigate the assessed risks of, and risk factors for, falling and malnutrition and the correlations between these assessed risks among older women and men in residential care. Further, the purpose was to investigate the consistency between planned and performed interventions among women and men assessed as at risk.
A cross-sectional registry study based on risk assessment data in the Swedish national quality registry, Senior Alert. Altogether, 5,919 older adults ≥65 in nursing homes and dementia care units in 19 municipalities in Sweden were included.
Of the older adults, 77% were at risk of falls, and 59% were at risk of malnutrition. The most prevalent risk factors for falls were previous falls and not being cognitively oriented; and for malnutrition were having mild or severe dementia or depression. A significant positive correlation between the risk of falling and the risk of malnutrition was found. Less than half of the planned interventions for falls and malnutrition were performed. Care staff's least common interventions to prevent falls were balance, muscular function, and strength training, which contrasts with the recommendations; interventions to prevent malnutrition were only partially adhering to recommendations.
This cross-sectional registry study points towards the importance of using an evidence-based approach, based on adherence to recommended guidelines, in the prevention of falling and malnutrition. Further, the implementation of clinical practice guidelines is needed, which requires educational training for care staff and supportive leadership.","['fall', 'malnutrition', 'older adults', 'prevention', 'quality registry']",SAGE open nursing,2021-07-22,"[{'lastname': 'Gusdal', 'firstname': 'Annelie K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'School of Health, Care and Social Welfare, Mälardalen University, Eskilstuna/Västerås, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Johansson-Pajala', 'firstname': 'Rose-Marie', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'School of Health, Care and Social Welfare, Mälardalen University, Eskilstuna/Västerås, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Arkkukangas', 'firstname': 'Marina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research and Development in Sörmland, Eskilstuna, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Ekholm', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research and Development in Sörmland, Eskilstuna, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Zander', 'firstname': 'Viktoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'School of Health, Care and Social Welfare, Mälardalen University, Eskilstuna/Västerås, Sweden.'}]",,,"Of the older adults, 77% were at risk of falls, and 59% were at risk of malnutrition.

32702537",Mortality in Patients With Late-Onset Epilepsy: Results From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.,"To determine the risk of mortality and causes of death in persons with late-onset epilepsy (LOE) compared to those without epilepsy in a community-based sample, adjusting for demographics and comorbid conditions.
This is an analysis of the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, initiated in 1987-1989 among 15,792 mostly Black and White men and women in 4 US communities. We used Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee-for-service claims codes to identify cases of incident epilepsy starting at or after age 67. We used Cox proportional hazards analysis to identify the hazard of mortality associated with LOE and to adjust for demographics and vascular risk factors. We used death certificate data to identify dates and causes of death.
Analyses included 9,090 participants, of whom 678 developed LOE during median 11.5 years of follow-up after age 67. Participants who developed LOE were at an increased hazard of mortality compared to those who did not, with adjusted hazard ratio 2.39 (95% confidence interval 2.12-2.71). We observed excess mortality due to stroke, dementia, neurologic conditions, and end-stage renal disease in participants with compared to without LOE. Only 4 deaths (1.1%) were directly attributed to seizure-related causes.
Persons who develop LOE are at increased risk of death compared to those without epilepsy, even after adjusting for comorbidities.

32425831",Coronary Artery Calcium Assessed Years Before Was Positively Associated With Subtle White Matter Injury of the Brain in Asymptomatic Middle-Aged Men: The Framingham Heart Study.,"Using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, we previously showed a cross-sectional association between carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, a measure of aortic stiffness, and subtle white matter injury in clinically asymptomatic middle-age adults. While coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a robust measure of atherosclerosis, and a predictor of stroke and dementia, whether it predicts diffusion tensor imaging-based subtle white matter injury in the brain remains unknown.
In FHS (Framingham Heart Study), an observational study, third-generation participants were assessed for CAC (2002-2005) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (2009-2014). Outcomes were diffusion tensor imaging-based measures; free water, fractional anisotropy, and peak width of mean diffusivity. After excluding the participants with neurological conditions and missing covariates, we categorized participants into 3 groups according to CAC score (0, 0 < to 100, and >100) and calculated a linear trend across the CAC groups. In secondary analyses treating CAC score as continuous, we computed slope of the outcomes per 20 to 80th percentiles higher log-transformed CAC score using linear regression.
In a total of 1052 individuals analyzed (mean age 45.4 years, 45.4% women), 71.6%, 22.4%, and 6.0% had CAC score of 0, 0 < to 100, and >100, respectively. We observed a significant linear trend of fractional anisotropy, but not other measures, across the CAC groups after multivariable adjustment. In the secondary analyses, CAC was associated with lower fractional anisotropy in men but not in women.
CAC may be a promising tool to predict prevalent subtle white matter injury of the brain in asymptomatic middle-aged men.","['atherosclerosis', 'coronary artery calcium', 'diffusion tensor imaging', 'pulse wave velocity', 'white matter']",Circulation.

We aimed to investigate the longitudinal association between body weight variability and PD incidence.
A nationwide population-based, cohort study was conducted using the database from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of the whole Korean population. We analyzed 2,815,135 participants (≥40 years old, mean age = 51.7 ± 8.6 years, 66.8% men) without a previous PD diagnosis. We determined individual body weight variability from baseline weight and follow-up visits. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models.
The highest quartile group was associated with increased PD incidence compared with the lowest quartile group after adjustment for confounding factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.29). In contrast, baseline body mass index, baseline waist circumference, and waist circumference variability were not associated with increased PD incidence. In the body weight loss group, individuals within the quartile of the highest variation in body weight showed a higher HR of PD risk than those within other quartiles (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.18-1.68).
Body weight variability, especially weight loss, was associated with higher PD incidence. This finding has important implications for clinicians and supports the need for preventative measures and surveillance for PD in individuals with fluctuating body weight.","['Parkinson disease', 'body mass index', 'body weight variability']",European journal of neurology,2021-07-14,"[{'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Joo-Hyun', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Yeonjoo', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Hyunjin', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Nam', 'firstname': 'Myung Ji', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Chung-Woo', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoo', 'firstname': 'Ji Won', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas School of Medicine, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Jin-Hyung', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Yong-Gyu', 'initials': 'YG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Kyungdo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Soongsil University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Do-Hoon', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.'}]",,,"The highest quartile group was associated with increased PD incidence compared with the lowest quartile group after adjustment for confounding factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.29).

24898656",Sex differences in dementia and response to a lifestyle intervention: Evidence from Nordic population-based studies and a prevention trial.,"Evidence on sex differences in the risk for dementia has been mixed. The goal was to assess sex differences in the development of dementia, and in the effects of a lifestyle intervention.
Two strategies were adopted, one using combined data from three large Nordic population-based cohort studies (n = 2289), adopting dementia as outcome, and 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention (n = 1260), adopting cognitive change as outcome.
There was higher risk for dementia after age 80 years in women. The positive effects of the lifestyle intervention on cognition did not significantly differ between men and women.

361,34254656,Headache as the sole presenting symptom of cerebral venous sinuses thrombosis: Subgroup analysis of data from the VENOST study.,"Headache is the most common complaint in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and it may sometimes be the only symptom in these patients. This retrospective and prospective study was an investigation of any differences in terms of clinical risk factors, radiological findings, or prognosis in patients with CVST who presented with isolated headache (IH) and cases with other concomitant findings (non-isolated headache [NIH]).
A total of 1144 patients from a multicenter study of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (VENOST study) were enrolled in this research. The demographic, biochemical, clinical, and radiological aspects of 287 IH cases and 857 NIH cases were compared.
There were twice as many women as men in the study group. In the IH group, when gender distribution was evaluated by age group, no statistically significant difference was found. The onset of headache was frequently subacute and chronic in the IH group, but an acute onset was more common in the NIH group. Other neurological findings were observed in 29% of the IH group during follow-up. A previous history of deep, cerebral, or other venous thromboembolism was less common in the IH group than in the NIH group. Transverse sinus involvement was greater in the IH group, whereas sagittal sinus involvement was greater in the NIH group. The presence of a plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) mutation was significantly greater in the IH group.
IH and CVST should be kept in mind if a patient has subacute or chronic headache. PAI, which has an important role in thrombolytic events, may be a risk factor in CVST. Detailed hematological investigations should be considered.

33332818",Delirium and Associated Factors in a Cohort of Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic dramatically increased the number of patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit or invasive mechanical ventilation worldwide. Delirium is a well-known neuropsychiatric complication of patients with acute respiratory diseases, representing the most frequent clinical expression of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients, especially in those undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, delirium incidence ranges from 11% to 80%, depending on the studied population and hospital setting.
To determine risk factors for the development of delirium in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
We retrospectively studied consecutive hospitalized adult (≥18 y) patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from March 15 to July 15, 2020, in a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico City. Delirium was assessed by the attending physician or trained nurse, with either the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit or the Confusion Assessment Method brief version, according to the appropriate diagnostic tool for each hospital setting. Consultation-liaison psychiatrists and neurologists confirmed all diagnoses. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model.
We studied 1017 (64.2% men; median age, 54 y; interquartile range 44-64), of whom 166 (16.3%) developed delirium (hyperactive in 75.3%); 78.9% of our delirium cases were detected in patients under invasive mechanical ventilation. The median of days from admission to diagnosis was 14 (interquartile range 8-21) days. Unadjusted mortality rates between delirium and no delirium groups were similar (23.3% vs. 24.1; risk ratio 0.962, 95% CI 0.70-1.33). Age (aHR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04; P = 0.006), an initial neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≥9 (aHR 1.81, 95% CI 1.23-2.65; P = 0.003), and requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (aHR 3.39, 95% CI 1.47-7.84; P = 0.004) were independent risk factors for in-hospital delirium development.
Delirium is a common in-hospital complication of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, associated with disease severity; given the extensive number of active COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is essential to detect patients who are most likely to develop delirium during hospitalization. Improving its preventive measures may reduce the risk of the long-term cognitive and functional sequelae associated with this neuropsychiatric complication.","['COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'cohort study', 'coronavirus', 'delirium', 'hospitalization']",Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry,2021-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'García-Grimshaw', 'firstname': 'Miguel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Chiquete', 'firstname': 'Erwin', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiménez-Ruiz', 'firstname': 'Amado', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Stroke, Dementia & Heart Disease Laboratory, Western University, London, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Vidal-Mayo', 'firstname': 'José de Jesús', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Emergency Department, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Grajeda-González', 'firstname': 'Samara Lissete', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Vargas-Martínez', 'firstname': 'María de Los Ángeles', 'initials': 'MLÁ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Toapanta-Yanchapaxi', 'firstname': 'Liz Nicole', 'initials': 'LN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Valdés-Ferrer', 'firstname': 'Sergio Iván', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico; Center for Biomedical Science, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY.'}, {'lastname': 'Chávez-Martínez', 'firstname': 'Oswaldo Alan', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Marché-Fernández', 'firstname': 'Osvaldo Alexis', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiménez-Ávila', 'firstname': 'Ana Itiel', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Cantú-Brito', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Flores-Silva', 'firstname': 'Fernando Daniel', 'initials': 'FD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.

20673982",Mapping phenotypic and aetiological associations between ADHD and physical conditions in adulthood in Sweden: a genetically informed register study.,"Emerging evidence suggests increased risk of several physical health conditions in people with ADHD. Only a few physical conditions have been thoroughly studied in relation to ADHD, and there is little knowledge on associations in older adults in particular. We aimed to investigate the phenotypic and aetiological associations between ADHD and a wide range of physical health conditions across adulthood.
We did a register study in Sweden and identified full-sibling and maternal half-sibling pairs born between Jan 1, 1932, and Dec 31, 1995, through the Population and Multi-Generation Registers. We excluded individuals who died or emigrated before Jan 1, 2005, and included full-siblings who were not twins and did not have half-siblings. ICD diagnoses were obtained from the National Patient Register. We extracted ICD diagnoses for physical conditions, when participants were aged 18 years or older, from inpatient (recorded 1973-2013) and outpatient (recorded 2001-13) services. Diagnoses were regarded as lifetime presence or absence. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between ADHD (exposure) and 35 physical conditions (outcomes) in individuals and across sibling pairs. Quantitative genetic modelling was used to estimate the extent to which genetic and environmental factors accounted for the associations with ADHD.
4 789 799 individuals were identified (2 449 146 [51%] men and 2 340 653 [49%] women), who formed 4 288 451 unique sibling pairs (3 819 207 full-sibling pairs and 469 244 maternal half-sibling pairs) and 1 841 303 family clusters (siblings, parents, cousins, spouses). The mean age at end of follow-up was 47 years (range 18-81; mean birth year 1966); ethnicity data were not available. Adults with ADHD had increased risk for most physical conditions (34 [97%] of 35) compared with adults without ADHD; the strongest associations were with nervous system disorders (eg, sleep disorders, epilepsy, dementia; odds ratios [ORs] 1·50-4·62) and respiratory diseases (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ORs 2·42-3·24). Sex-stratified analyses showed similar patterns of results in men and women. Stronger cross-disorder associations were found between full-siblings than between half-siblings for nervous system, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and metabolic diseases (p<0·007). Quantitative genetic modelling showed that these associations were largely explained by shared genetic factors (60-69% of correlations), except for associations with nervous system disorders, which were mainly explained by non-shared environmental factors.
This mapping of aetiological sources of cross-disorder overlap can guide future research aiming to identify specific mechanisms contributing to risk of physical conditions in people with ADHD, which could ultimately inform preventive and lifestyle intervention efforts. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the presence of physical conditions in patients with ADHD.

31606366",A Lifecourse Perspective on Female Sex-Specific Risk Factors for Later Life Cognition.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is greater in women compared to men. We provide a review of female sex-specific risk factors across the lifecourse for cognition in older adulthood, highlighting areas that need further study.
Pregnancy may affect late-life cognition, with adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline but parity providing a protective effect. Cumulative estrogen exposure, influenced by age of menarche, menopause, and exogenous estrogen use, may modify a woman's risk for dementia. Menopause transition-associated symptoms may impact cognitive health at the time of the symptoms, but long-term effects remain unknown. As compared to natural menopause, surgical menopause seems to increase the risk for cognitive impairment. Studies that have assessed the association between women's reproductive health and cognition have produced conflicting results. Future studies that address these inconsistencies among diverse populations are needed to better care for women throughout their lives.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Dementia', 'Reproductive health', 'Risk factors', 'Sex', 'Women']",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,2021-07-07,"[{'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Amalia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ajp2260@cumc.columbia.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Tom', 'firstname': 'Sarah E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.'}]",,,,,10.1007/s11910-021-01133-y,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df946cc0>,,,,,,

27303061",Effect of Demographic and Health Dynamics on Cognitive Status in Mexico between 2001 and 2015: Evidence from the Mexican Health and Aging Study.,"Sources of health disparities such as educational attainment, cardiovascular risk factors, and access to health care affect cognitive impairment among older adults. To examine the extent to which these counteracting changes affect cognitive aging over time among Mexican older adults, we examine how sociodemographic factors, cardiovascular diseases, and their treatment relate to changes in cognitive function of Mexican adults aged 60 and older between 2001 and 2015. Self and proxy respondents were classified as dementia, cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), and normal cognition. We use logistic regression models to examine the trends in dementia and CIND for men and women aged 60 years or older using pooled national samples of 6822 individuals in 2001 and 10,219 in 2015, and sociodemographic and health variables as covariates. We found higher likelihood of dementia and a lower risk of CIND in 2015 compared to 2001. These results remain after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, cardiovascular diseases, and their treatment. The improvements in educational attainment, treatment of diabetes and hypertension, and better access to health care in 2015 compared to 2001 may not have been enough to counteract the combined effects of aging, rural residence disadvantage, and higher risks of cardiovascular disease among older Mexican adults.","['cognitive aging', 'epidemiology', 'healthcare disparities', 'minority health']","Geriatrics (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-07-03,"[{'lastname': 'Mejia-Arango', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Studies, El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, Tijuana 22560, Baja California, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Avila', 'firstname': 'Jaqueline', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, School of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Downer', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia', 'firstname': 'Marc A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sociology, Institute for Ethnic Studies, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68588-0324, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Michaels-Obregon', 'firstname': 'Alejandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saenz', 'firstname': 'Joseph L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Samper-Ternent', 'firstname': 'Rafael', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Rebeca', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/geriatrics6030063

31549581",Long-Term Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Cognitive Decline and Dementia Among Older Adults.,"Background Blood pressure variability (BPV) in midlife increases risk of late-life dementia, but the impact of BPV on the cognition of adults who have already reached older ages free of major cognitive deficits is unknown. We examined the risk of incident dementia and cognitive decline associated with long-term, visit-to-visit BPV in a post hoc analysis of the ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial. Methods and Results ASPREE participants (N=19 114) were free of dementia and significant cognitive impairment at enrollment. Measurement of BP and administration of a standardized cognitive battery evaluating global cognition, delayed episodic memory, verbal fluency, and processing speed and attention occurred at baseline and follow-up visits. Time-to-event analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CI for incident dementia and cognitive decline, according to tertile of SD of systolic BPV. Individuals in the highest BPV tertile compared with the lowest had an increased risk of incident dementia and cognitive decline, independent of average BP and use of antihypertensive drugs. There was evidence that sex modified the association with incident dementia (interaction ","['blood pressure', 'blood pressure variability', 'cognitive impairment', 'dementia']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2021-06-29,"[{'lastname': 'Ernst', 'firstname': 'Michael E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science College of Pharmacy The University of Iowa Iowa City IA.\nDepartment of Family Medicine Carver College of Medicine The University of Iowa Iowa City IA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chowdhury', 'firstname': 'Enayet K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.\nSchool of Public Health Curtin University Perth Western Australia Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Margolis', 'firstname': 'Karen L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'HealthPartners Institute Minneapolis MN.'}, {'lastname': 'Beilin', 'firstname': 'Lawrence J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Medical School Royal Perth HospitalUniversity of Western Australia Perth Western Australia Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Reid', 'firstname': 'Christopher M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.\nSchool of Public Health Curtin University Perth Western Australia Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'Mark R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research University of Tasmania Hobart Tasmania Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Woods', 'firstname': 'Robyn L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Raj C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': ""Department of Family Medicine Rush University Medical Center Chicago IL.\nRush Alzheimer's Disease Center Rush University Medical Center Chicago IL.""}, {'lastname': 'Orchard', 'firstname': 'Suzanne G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wolfe', 'firstname': 'Rory', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Storey', 'firstname': 'Elsdon', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tonkin', 'firstname': 'Andrew M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Brodtmann', 'firstname': 'Amy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McNeil', 'firstname': 'John J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Murray', 'firstname': 'Anne M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Berman Center for Outcomes and Clinical Research Hennepin-Health Research InstituteHennepin Healthcare Minneapolis MN.\nDivision of Geriatrics Department of Medicine Hennepin Healthcare Minneapolis MN.'}]",,,,,"10.1161/JAHA.120.019613

32761580",Development and validation of a predictive algorithm for risk of dementia in the community setting.,"Most dementia algorithms are unsuitable for population-level assessment and planning as they are designed for use in the clinical setting. A predictive risk algorithm to estimate 5-year dementia risk in the community setting was developed.
The Dementia Population Risk Tool (DemPoRT) was derived using Ontario respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey (survey years 2001 to 2012). Five-year incidence of physician-diagnosed dementia was ascertained by individual linkage to administrative healthcare databases and using a validated case ascertainment definition with follow-up to March 2017. Sex-specific proportional hazards regression models considering competing risk of death were developed using self-reported risk factors including information on socio-demographic characteristics, general and chronic health conditions, health behaviours and physical function.
Among 75 460 respondents included in the combined derivation and validation cohorts, there were 8448 cases of incident dementia in 348 677 person-years of follow-up (5-year cumulative incidence, men: 0.044, 95% CI: 0.042 to 0.047; women: 0.057, 95% CI: 0.055 to 0.060). The final full models each include 90 df (65 main effects and 25 interactions) and 28 predictors (8 continuous). The DemPoRT algorithm is discriminating (C-statistic in validation data: men 0.83 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.85); women 0.83 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.85)) and well-calibrated in a wide range of subgroups including behavioural risk exposure categories, socio-demographic groups and by diabetes and hypertension status.
This algorithm will support the development and evaluation of population-level dementia prevention strategies, support decision-making for population health and can be used by individuals or their clinicians for individual risk assessment.","['dementia', 'disease modeling', 'epidemiology', 'public health']",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2021-06-27,"[{'lastname': 'Fisher', 'firstname': 'Stacey', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada stacey.fisher@utoronto.ca.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nSchool of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Manuel', 'firstname': 'Douglas G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nSchool of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nHealth Analysis Division, Statistics Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nCentre for Individualized Health, Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsu', 'firstname': 'Amy T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nSchool of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nCentre for Individualized Health, Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bennett', 'firstname': 'Carol', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tuna', 'firstname': 'Meltem', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bader Eddeen', 'firstname': 'Anan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sequeira', 'firstname': 'Yulric', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nSchool of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Jessri', 'firstname': 'Mahsa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nHealth Analysis Division, Statistics Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Taljaard', 'firstname': 'Monica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nSchool of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Anderson', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Cardiovascular Research, ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nInstitute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanuseputro', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nPopulations & Public Health, ICES, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nCentre for Individualized Health, Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}]",,,"Among 75 460 respondents included in the combined derivation and validation cohorts, there were 8448 cases of incident dementia in 348 677 person-years of follow-up (5-year cumulative incidence, men: 0.044, 95% CI: 0.042 to 0.047; women: 0.057, 95% CI: 0.055 to 0.060).

24377421",Healthcare-related impact of gout in hospitalized patients in Spain.,"To analyze the epidemiology, clinical features and costs of hospitalized patients with gout during the last decade in Spain. Retrospective observational study based on data from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) from the Spanish National Health Service database. Patients ≥ 18 years with any gout diagnosis at discharge who had been admitted to public or private hospitals between 2005 and 2015 were included. Patients were divided in two periods: p1 (2005-2010) and p2 (2011-2015) to compare the number of hospitalizations, mean costs and mortality rates. Data from 192,037 patients with gout was analyzed. There was an increase in the number of hospitalized patients with gout (p < 0.001). The more frequent comorbidities were diabetes (27.6% of patients), kidney disease (26.6%) and heart failure (19.3%). Liver disease (OR 2.61), dementia (OR 2.13), cerebrovascular diseases (OR 1.57), heart failure (OR 1.41), and kidney disease (OR 1.34) were associated with a higher mortality risk. Women had a lower risk of mortality than men (OR 0.85). General mortality rates in these hospitalized patients progressively increased over the years (p < 0.001). In addition, costs gradually rose, presenting a significant increase in p2 even after adjusting for inflation (p = 0.001). A progressive increase in hospitalizations, mortality rates and cost in hospitalized patients with gout was observed. This harmful trend in a preventable illness highlights the need for change and the search for new healthcare strategies.",[],Scientific reports,2021-06-26,"[{'lastname': 'Benavent', 'firstname': 'Diego', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Rheumatology Service, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPaz, Madrid, Spain. d_benavent@hotmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Peiteado', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Rheumatology Service, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPaz, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martinez-Huedo', 'firstname': 'María Ángeles', 'initials': 'MÁ', 'affiliation': 'Preventive Medicine and Public Health Teaching and Research Unit, Hospital Universitario La Paz , Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Hernandez-Hurtado', 'firstname': 'María', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'General Practice and Community Medicine Unit, Hospital Fundación Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Balsa', 'firstname': 'Alejandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Rheumatology Service, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPaz, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'de Miguel', 'firstname': 'Eugenio', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Rheumatology Service, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPaz, Madrid, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-021-92673-3

32498973",Body mass index and severity/fatality from coronavirus disease 2019: A nationwide epidemiological study in Korea.,"Obesity has been reported as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in recent studies. However, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 severity and fatality are unclear.
This study included 4,141 COVID-19 patients who were released from isolation or had died as of April 30, 2020. This nationwide data was provided by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency. BMI was categorized as follows; < 18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-22.9 kg/m2, 23.0-24.9 kg/m2, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2, and ≥ 30 kg/m2. We defined a fatal illness if the patient had died.
Among participants, those with a BMI of 18.5-22.9 kg/m2 were the most common (42.0%), followed by 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (24.4%), 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 (24.3%), ≥ 30 kg/m2 (4.7%), and < 18.5 kg/m2 (4.6%). In addition, 1,654 (41.2%) were men and 3.04% were fatalities. Multivariable analysis showed that age, male sex, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and dementia were independent risk factors for fatal illness. In particular, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR] 3.97, 95% CI 1.77-8.92), 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (2.43, 1.32-4.47), and ≥ 30 kg/m2 (4.32, 1.37-13.61) were found to have higher ORs than the BMI of 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 (reference). There was no significant difference between those with a BMI of 18.5-22.9 kg/m2 (1.59, 0.88-2.89) and 23.0-24.9 kg/m2.
This study demonstrated a non-linear (U-shaped) relationship between BMI and fatal illness. Subjects with a BMI of < 18.5 kg/m2 and those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 had a high risk of fatal illness. Maintaining a healthy weight is important not only to prevent chronic cardiometabolic diseases, but also to improve the outcome of COVID-19.",[],PloS one,2021-06-23,"[{'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'In Sook', 'initials': 'IS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, College of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kong', 'firstname': 'Kyoung Ae', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}]",,,"Among participants, those with a BMI of 18.5-22.9 kg/m2 were the most common (42.0%), followed by 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (24.4%), 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 (24.3%), ≥ 30 kg/m2 (4.7%), and < 18.5 kg/m2 (4.6%).

This study examines the association between one's own education separate from and in conjunction with spousal education and risk of dementia.
Cohort.
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care delivery system.
8835 members of KPNC who were aged 40-55, married and reported own and spousal education in 1964-1973.
Dementia cases were identified through medical records from 1 January 1996 to 30 September 2017.
Own and spousal education was self-reported in 1964-1973 and each was classified as four indicator variables (≤high school, trade school/some college, college degree and postgraduate) and as ≥college degree versus <college degree. Age as timescale weighted Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographics and health indicators evaluated associations between participant education, spousal education and dementia risk overall and by gender and race/ethnicity.
The cohort was 37% non-white, 46% men and 30% were diagnosed with dementia during follow-up from 1996 to 2017 (mean follow-up=12.7 years). Greater participant education was associated with lower dementia risk independent of spousal education, demographics and health indicators. Greater spousal education was associated with lower dementia adjusting for demographics but became non-significant after further adjustment for participant education. The same pattern was seen for spousal education ≥college degree (not adjusting for participant education HR
In a large diverse cohort, we found that higher levels of participant's own education were associated with lower dementia risk regardless of spousal education.

372,34133024,Mortality trends of stroke and dementia: Changing landscapes and new challenges.,"Stroke and dementia are important causes of death in the United States and may be interrelated as competing risks for mortality. No previous studies have simultaneously compared age- and sex-specific mortality trends between stroke and subtypes of dementia at a population level. Insights gained from this study can help identify high-risk populations and inform healthcare service requirements for managing stroke and dementia in the United States.
To examine nationwide trends in mortality from stroke and subtypes of dementia in the United States by age group and sex.
Population-based cross-sectional study.
U.S. mortality data from 2007 to 2016.
All U.S. residents whose primary cause of death was stroke, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or Lewy body dementia.
Age-adjusted mortality, mortality trends among men and women were analyzed separately using joinpoint regression.
From 2007 to 2016, age-adjusted stroke mortality fell by 21.6%. Age-adjusted mortality (per 1,000,000) for Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia increased by 1.2-fold, 2-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. Annual age-adjusted stroke mortality decreased by an average rate of 2.67% per year, while annual age-adjusted mortality for Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia increased by an average rate of 2.06%, 4.90%, and 12.13% per year, respectively. Mortality from stroke and dementia increased with age. Greater reductions in stroke mortality and greater increases in dementia mortality were seen in women than men; and in older than younger (<65 years) people.
There has been a striking rising trend in dementia mortality coincident with a reduction in stroke mortality in the United States. There are persistent age and sex disparities in stroke and dementia mortality trends. Our findings support the pathophysiological relationship between stroke and dementia, and have important implications for future research, healthcare planning, and provision.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Lewy body dementia', 'mortality', 'sex difference', 'stroke', 'vascular dementia']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2021-06-17,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Harry', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Clinical Pharmacology and Aged Care, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.\nLaboratory of Ageing and Pharmacology, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.\nFaculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Le Couteur', 'firstname': 'David G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nAgeing and Alzheimer's Institute (AAAI), Centre for Education and Research on Ageing (CERA) and ANZAC Research Institute, Concord Hospital, Concord, New South Wales, Australia.\nCharles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Hilmer', 'firstname': 'Sarah N', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Clinical Pharmacology and Aged Care, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.\nLaboratory of Ageing and Pharmacology, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.\nFaculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}]",,,"From 2007 to 2016, age-adjusted stroke mortality fell by 21.6%.

19273750",Association of Sleep With Risk of Alzheimer's Disease Mortality: NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias contribute to one in three senior deaths. Lifestyle factors, including sleep, may contribute to AD risk and mortality; however, current evidence on sleep and AD mortality is mixed.
We used data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Sleep duration and napping were self-reported and AD death were ascertained via linkage to the National Death Index.
Long sleep and napping were both associated with increased AD mortality. Specifically, 9+ hr of sleep was associated with 50% increase (hazard ratio = 1.50, 95% CI = [1.17, 1.92]) in AD mortality when compared 7 to 8 hr, while napping for 1+ hr was associated with 29% increase (1.29 [1.08, 1.55]) when compared with no napping. Results appeared to be stronger in men and remained after removing AD deaths within first 5 years after baseline.

374,34092647,Rats Display Sexual Dimorphism in Phosphorylation of Brain Tau with Age.,"Women have a two-fold higher risk than men to Alzheimer's disease (AD) at midlife. Larger brain tau burden was consistently shown in older women than age-matched men. The biological basis for this gender disparity remains elusive.
We sought to know whether tau expression and phosphorylation physiologically differ between males and females.
We used western blots and immunohistochemistry to compare the levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) between sexes in Wistar rats at 40 days, and 8 and 20 months of age.
We detected no statistically significant difference in total tau, 3R-tau, and 4R-tau between sexes. However, female rats exhibited lower levels of tau unphosphorylated at the Tau-1 site at 40 days of age. At 8 months of age, females showed higher levels of tau phosphorylated at Ser190, Ser387, and Ser395 (Ser199, Ser396, and Ser404 of human tau, respectively) than males in EC. At 20 months of age, both brain regions of female rats consistently showed higher levels than males of tau phosphorylated at Ser253, Ser387, PHF-1 (Ser387/395), and Ser413 sites, which correspond to Ser262, Ser396, Ser396/404, and Ser422 of human tau, respectively.
Rats of both sexes have comparable levels of total tau, 3R-tau, and 4R-tau, whereas females exhibit higher levels of tau phosphorylated at multiple sites that are implicated in AD tau pathology, indicating a sexual dimorphism of tau phosphorylation that may potentially underlie the disparity in brain tau burden and risk for AD between sexes.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'entorhinal cortex', 'gender', 'hippocampus', 'protein phosphorylation', 'tau expression', 'tau isoforms']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Niu', 'firstname': 'Jiahui', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurochemistry, Inge Grundke-Iqbal Research Floor, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Iqbal', 'firstname': 'Khalid', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurochemistry, Inge Grundke-Iqbal Research Floor, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Fei', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurochemistry, Inge Grundke-Iqbal Research Floor, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Wen', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurochemistry, Inge Grundke-Iqbal Research Floor, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY, USA.'}]",,"Rats of both sexes have comparable levels of total tau, 3R-tau, and 4R-tau, whereas females exhibit higher levels of tau phosphorylated at multiple sites that are implicated in AD tau pathology, indicating a sexual dimorphism of tau phosphorylation that may potentially underlie the disparity in brain tau burden and risk for AD between sexes.","We detected no statistically significant difference in total tau, 3R-tau, and 4R-tau between sexes.

24567425",Geographical Variability in Mortality in Urban Areas: A Joint Analysis of 16 Causes of Death.,"The geographical distribution of mortality has frequently been studied. Nevertheless, those studies often consider isolated causes of death. In this work, we aim to study the geographical distribution of mortality in urban areas, in particular, in 26 Spanish cities. We perform an overall study of 16 causes of death, considering that their geographical patterns could be dependent and estimating the dependence between the causes of death. We study the deaths in these 26 cities during the period 1996-2015 at the census tract level. A multivariate disease mapping model is used in order to solve the potential small area estimation problems that these data could show. We find that most of the geographical patterns found show positive correlations. This suggests the existence of a transversal geographical pattern, common to most causes of deaths, which determines those patterns to a higher/lower extent depending on each disease. The causes of death that exhibit that underlying pattern in a more prominent manner are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cirrhosis for men and cardiovascular diseases and dementias for women. Such findings are quite consistent for most of the cities in the study. The high positive correlation found between geographical patterns reflects the existence of both high and low-risk areas in urban settings, in general terms for nearly all the causes of death. Moreover, the high-risk areas found often coincide with neighborhoods known for their high deprivation. Our results suggest that dependence among causes of death is a key aspect to be taken into account when mapping mortality, at least in urban contexts.","['geographical inequalities', 'mortality', 'multivariate disease mapping', 'urban areas']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-06-03,"[{'lastname': 'Martinez-Beneito', 'firstname': 'Miguel A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': ""Departament d'Estadística e Investigaciò Opertiva, Universitat de València, 46100 Burjassot, Spain.\nCIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Vergara-Hernández', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'FISABIO Foundation, 46020 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Botella-Rocamora', 'firstname': 'Paloma', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Dirección General de Salut Pública i Adiccions, Conselleria de Sanitat Universal y Salut Pública, 46020 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Corpas-Burgos', 'firstname': 'Francisca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nFISABIO Foundation, 46020 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Pérez-Panadés', 'firstname': 'Jordi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Dirección General de Salut Pública i Adiccions, Conselleria de Sanitat Universal y Salut Pública, 46020 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Zurriaga', 'firstname': 'Óscar', 'initials': 'Ó', 'affiliation': ""CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nFISABIO Foundation, 46020 Valencia, Spain.\nDirección General de Salut Pública i Adiccions, Conselleria de Sanitat Universal y Salut Pública, 46020 Valencia, Spain.\nDepartament de Medicina Preventiva, Salut Pública, Ciències de l'Alimentación, Toxicología i Medicina Legal, Universitat de València, 46010 Valencia, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Aldasoro', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Dirección de Salud Pública y Adicciones, 48013 Bilbao, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Borrell', 'firstname': 'Carme', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nAgència de Salut Pública de Barcelona, 08023 Barcelona, Spain.\nInstitut d'Investigació Biomèdica (IIB Sant Pau), 08025 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Cabeza', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Institut d'investigació sanitària de les Illes Balears, 07120 Palma de Mallorca, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Cirera', 'firstname': 'Lluís', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Regional Health Council-IMIB-Arrixaca, 30008 Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Delfrade Osinaga', 'firstname': 'Josu', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nInstituto de Salud Pública y Laboral de Navarra, 31003 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernández-Somoano', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nIUOPA-Medicine Department, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.\nInstituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33001 Oviedo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gandarillas', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Consejeria de Sanidad, 28035 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Lorenzo Ruano', 'firstname': 'Pedro L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': 'Servicio Canario de Salud, 35018 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.'}, {'lastname': ""Marí-Dell'Olmo"", 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nAgència de Salut Pública de Barcelona, 08023 Barcelona, Spain.\nInstitut d'Investigació Biomèdica (IIB Sant Pau), 08025 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Nolasco', 'firstname': 'Andreu', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Universidad de Alicante, 03690 San Vicente del Raspeig, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Prieto-Salceda', 'firstname': 'M Dolores', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Fundación Marqués de Valdecilla-Observatorio de Salud Pública de Cantabria, 39008 Santander, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramis', 'firstname': 'Rebeca', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nInstituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Sanz', 'firstname': 'Maica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nAgència de Salut Pública de Barcelona, 08023 Barcelona, Spain.\nInstitut d'Investigació Biomèdica (IIB Sant Pau), 08025 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Sánchez-Villegas', 'firstname': 'Pablo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Escuela Andaluza de Salud Pública, 18011 Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'The Medea Project Group', 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph18115664

12920701",Lung Function Impairment and the Risk of Incident Dementia: The Rotterdam Study.,"The etiology of dementia may partly be underpinned by impaired lung function via systemic inflammation and hypoxia.
To prospectively examine the association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and subclinical impairments in lung function and the risk of dementia.
In the Rotterdam Study, we assessed the risk of incident dementia in participants with Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry (PRISm; FEV1/FVC≥0.7, FEV1 < 80% predicted) and in participants with COPD (FEV1/FVC < 0.7) compared to those with normal spirometry (controls; FEV1/FVC≥0.7, FEV1≥80% predicted). Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dementia were adjusted for age, sex, education attainment, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, triglycerides, comorbidities and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.
Of 4,765 participants, 110 (2.3%) developed dementia after 3.3 years. Compared to controls, participants with PRISm, but not COPD, had an increased risk for all-type dementia (adjusted HRPRISm 2.70; 95% CI, 1.53-4.75; adjusted HRCOPD 1.03; 95% CI, 0.61-1.74). These findings were primarily driven by men and smokers. Similarly, participants with FVC% predicted values in the lowest quartile compared to those in the highest quartile were at increased risk of all-type dementia (adjusted HR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.31-3.98), as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD; adjusted HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.13-4.02).
Participants with PRISm or a low FVC% predicted lung function were at increased risk of dementia, compared to those with normal spirometry or a higher FVC% predicted, respectively. Further research is needed to elucidate whether this association is causal and how PRISm might contribute to dementia pathogenesis.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'dementia', 'forced vital capacity (FVC)', 'preserved ratio impaired spirometry']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-06-01,"[{'lastname': 'Xiao', 'firstname': 'Tian', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wijnant', 'firstname': 'Sara R A', 'initials': 'SRA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.\nDepartment of Bioanalysis, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Licher', 'firstname': 'Silvan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Terzikhan', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Lahousse', 'firstname': 'Lies', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioanalysis, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Ikram', 'firstname': 'M Kamran', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Neurology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Brusselle', 'firstname': 'Guy G', 'initials': 'GG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ikram', 'firstname': 'M Arfan', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}]",,"Participants with PRISm or a low FVC% predicted lung function were at increased risk of dementia, compared to those with normal spirometry or a higher FVC% predicted, respectively.

33245660",Steroid 21-hydroxylase gene variants and late-life depression.,"A feature of late-life depression is alterations of the stress hormone system. The CYP21A2 gene encodes for the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme which is required for the biosynthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, two main components of the stress response in humans. Variants in the CYP21A2 gene could influence risk of late-life depression, but this has not been examined. This study investigated possible associations between five variants in the CYP21A2 gene and late-life depression in 1007 older community-dwelling men and women.
In multivariate logistic regression model, significant associations were found between three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs389883, rs437179, and rs630379) and depression in women specifically (OR ranging from 1.51 to 1.68, p-values 0.025 to 0.0045), and the two latter remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Variants of the CYP21A2 gene appear as susceptibility factors for late-life depression in a sex-specific manner, independently of somatic and neuropsychiatric comorbidity.","['Corticosteroids', 'Late-life depression', 'Older adults', 'Population-based study', 'Single-nucleotide polymorphisms', 'Stress']",BMC research notes,2021-05-27,"[{'lastname': 'Ancelin', 'firstname': 'Marie-Laure', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France. marie-laure.ancelin@inserm.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Norton', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ritchie', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.\nCentre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaudieu', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'INM, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Biological Neuropsychiatry and Dementia Unit, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}]",,,"In multivariate logistic regression model, significant associations were found between three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs389883, rs437179, and rs630379) and depression in women specifically (OR ranging from 1.51 to 1.68, p-values 0.025 to 0.0045), and the two latter remained significant after correction for multiple testing.

20044530",Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies.,"Patients with stroke due to spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) are at risk of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, and other serious vascular events. We aimed to analyse these risks in population-based studies and compare them with the risks in RESTART, which assessed antiplatelet therapy after ICH.
We pooled individual patient data from two prospective, population-based inception cohort studies of all patients with an incident firs-in-a-lifetime ICH in Oxfordshire, England (Oxford Vascular Study; April 1, 2002, to Sept 28, 2018) and Lothian, Scotland, UK (Lothian Audit of the Treatment of Cerebral Haemorrhage; June 1, 2010, to May 31, 2013). We quantified the absolute and relative risks of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, or any serious vascular event (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death), stratified by ICH location (lobar vs non-lobar) and comorbid atrial fibrillation (AF). We compared pooled event rates with those after allocation to avoid antiplatelet therapy in RESTART.
Among 674 patients (mean age 74·7 years [SD 12·6], 320 [47%] men) with 1553 person-years of follow-up, 46 recurrent ICHs (event rate 3·2 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 2·0-5·1) and 25 ischaemic strokes (1·7 per 100 patient-years, 0·8-3·3) were reported. Patients with lobar ICH (n=317) had higher risk of recurrent ICH (5·1 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 3·6-7·2) than patients with non-lobar ICH (n=355; 1·8 per 100 patient-years, 1·0-3·3; hazard ratio [HR] 3·2, 95% CI 1·6-6·3; p=0·0010), but there was no evidence of a difference in the risk of ischaemic stroke (1·8 per 100 patient-years, 1·0-3·2, vs 1·6 per 100 patient-years, 0·6-4·4; HR 1·1, 95% CI 0·5-2·8). Conversely, there was no evidence of a difference in recurrent ICH rate in patients with AF (n=147; 3·3 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 1·0-10·7) compared with those without (n=526; 3·2 per 100 patient-years, 2·2-4·7; HR 0·9, 95% CI 0·4-2·1), but the risk of ischaemic stroke was higher with AF (6·3 per 100 patient-years, 3·7-10·9, vs 0·7 per 100 patient-years, 0·1-5·6; HR 8·2, 3·3-20·3; p<0·0001), resulting in patients with AF having a higher risk of all serious vascular events than patients without AF (15·5 per 100 patient-years, 10·0-24·1, vs 6·8 per 100 patient-years, 3·6-12·5; HR 1·78, 95% CI 1·16-2·74; p=0·0090). Only for patients with lobar ICH without comorbid AF was the risk of recurrent ICH greater than the risk of ischaemic stroke (5·2 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 3·6-7·5, vs 0·9 per 100 patient-years, 0·2-4·8; p=0·00034). Comparing data from the pooled population-based studies with that from patients allocated to not receive antiplatelet therapy in RESTART, there was no evidence of a difference in the rate of recurrent ICH (3·5 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 1·9-6·0, vs 4·4 per 100 patient-years, 2·6-6·1) or ischaemic stroke (3·4 per 100 patient-years, 1·9-5·9, vs 5·3 per 100 patient-years, 3·3-7·2).
The risks of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, and all serious vascular events after ICH differ by ICH location and comorbid AF. These data enable risk stratification of patients in clinical practice and ongoing randomised trials.

32398686",Sex differences in the association between major cardiovascular risk factors in midlife and dementia: a cohort study using data from the UK Biobank.,"Sex differences in major cardiovascular risk factors for incident (fatal or non-fatal) all-cause dementia were assessed in the UK Biobank. The effects of these risk factors on all-cause dementia were explored by age and socioeconomic status (SES).
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and women-to-men ratio of HRs (RHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), smoking, diabetes, adiposity, stroke, SES and lipids with dementia. Poisson regression was used to estimate the sex-specific incidence rate of dementia for these risk factors.
502,226 individuals in midlife (54.4% women, mean age 56.5 years) with no prevalent dementia were included in the analyses. Over 11.8 years (median), 4068 participants (45.9% women) developed dementia. The crude incidence rates were 5.88 [95% CI 5.62-6.16] for women and 8.42 [8.07-8.78] for men, per 10,000 person-years. Sex was associated with the risk of dementia, where the risk was lower in women than men (HR = 0.83 [0.77-0.89]). Current smoking, diabetes, high adiposity, prior stroke and low SES were associated with a greater risk of dementia, similarly in women and men. The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and dementia was U-shaped in men but had a dose-response relationship in women: the HR for SBP per 20 mmHg was 1.08 [1.02-1.13] in women and 0.98 [0.93-1.03] in men. This sex difference was not affected by the use of antihypertensive medication at baseline. The sex difference in the effect of raised BP was consistent for dementia subtypes (vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease).
Several mid-life cardiovascular risk factors were associated with dementia similarly in women and men, but not raised BP. Future bespoke BP-lowering trials are necessary to understand its role in restricting cognitive decline and to clarify any sex difference.","['Dementia', 'Risk factor', 'Sex difference', 'UK Biobank']",BMC medicine,2021-05-20,"[{'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia. jgong@georgeinstitute.org.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Peters', 'firstname': 'Sanne A E', 'initials': 'SAE', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, Central Working - Fourth Floor, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College London, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.\nJulius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, PO Box 85500, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodward', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Level 5, 1 King St, Newtown, NSW, 2042, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Imperial College London, Central Working - Fourth Floor, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College London, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.\nWelch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}]",,,"502,226 individuals in midlife (54.4% women, mean age 56.5 years) with no prevalent dementia were included in the analyses.

381,34006203,Inpatient Suicides in Late Life: A Retrospective Analysis of a Hospital Group with Nine Psychiatric Clinics.,"Inpatient suicides are rare incidents; however, the impacts of such events on associated families and hospital staff are severe. Therefore, preventive strategies need to focus on risk factors. Clinical management in a hospital setting must integrate the home environment and social life of patients. Nevertheless, home leaves require careful preparation.
Suicides were reported systematically from all psychiatric departments of the Landschaftsverband Rheinland (an assembly of municipalities) using a structured form during two periods (1995-2004, 2005-2014). From these reports we extracted data on suicide methods and sociodemographic and clinical variables. Only patients 65 years and older were included.
From a total of 551 reports on suicides in the period of 1995-2014, 103 patients 65 years and older (60 women, 43 men) died by suicide. In contrast to the general trend in Germany during this period, no decline in overall suicide rates was found. Most patients were treated because of depression (73.8%); schizophrenic psychosis was diagnosed in 11.7%; and dementia was only diagnosed in 1.9%. The most frequent suicide method was hanging (40%). All suicides within the hospital were hangings. The majority of suicides occurred outside the hospital during approved home leaves. Only 7% of suicides occurred when patients left the hospital without permission. Almost half of the patients (
In the first weeks of hospitalizations the patients are most endangered to die by suicide.

Cohort study.
All patients admitted with AMI (ICD-10-AM codes I21.0-I21.4) to all public and most private hospitals in Australia and New Zealand during 2009-2015.
All-cause mortality up to seven years after an AMI.
239 402 initial admissions with AMI were identified; the mean age of the patients was 69.3 years (SD, 14.3 years), 154 287 were men (64.5%), and 64 335 had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; 26.9%). 7-year survival after AMI was 62.3% (STEMI, 70.8%; non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], 59.2%); survival exceeded 85% for people under 65 years of age, but was 17.4% for those aged 85 years or more. 120 155 patients (50.2%) underwent revascularisation (STEMI, 72.2%; NSTEMI, 42.1%); 7-year survival exceeded 80% for patients in each group who underwent revascularisation, and was lower than 45% for those who did not. Being older (85 years or older v 18-54 years: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 10.6; 95% CI, 10.1-11.1) or a woman (aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.17) were each associated with greater long term mortality during the study period, as was prior heart failure (aHR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.76-1.83).

383,33989962,Sex differences in the association between the APOEε4 allele and hearing impairment: A longitudinal memory clinic study.,"The APOEε4 allele and hearing impairment are risk factors for dementia. Cross-sectional studies have shown controversial findings regarding the relationship between APOEε4 and hearing impairment. These may be explained by reported sex differences in the association between APOEε4 and some Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. We aimed to investigate APOEε4 and hearing impairment in a longitudinal setting considering the modifying effects of sex on APOEε4.
In total, 1810 subjects with APOE genotype at Ilsan Hospital memory clinics were linked to the longitudinal National Health Insurance Service database with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes of hearing impairment. After excluding cases with prevalent hearing impairment and incomplete records, 1092 subjects were analyzed for the period January 2004-July 2019. We used Cox proportional hazard models with or without adjustment for education, hypertension, diabetes, and cognitive function. Effect modification was analyzed by sex stratification and by adding APOEε4 by sex interaction terms.
Hearing impairment did not differ between APOEε4 carriers and non-carriers. Sex-stratification analysis with an unadjusted model showed men with APOEε4 developed more hearing impairment than men without (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.20-3.01), but women did not. The results remained similar in covariate-adjusted models. The interaction between APOEε4 and sex was also significant regardless of adjustment.
Our longitudinal analyses suggested male memory clinic visitors with APOEε4 allele were more likely to develop hearing impairment than those without the genotype. This group may benefit more from regular monitoring and preventive measures for hearing impairment.","['APOE', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Dementia', 'Hearing impairment', 'Longitudinal', 'Sex']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2021-05-15,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Chi-Hun', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital, Daegu, South Korea; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Son', 'firstname': 'Kang Ju', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Management Team, Ilsan hospital, National Health Insurance Service, Goyang-shi, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jun Hong', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dementia Center, Ilsan hospital, National Health Insurance Service, Goyang-shi, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jong Hun', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dementia Center, Ilsan hospital, National Health Insurance Service, Goyang-shi, South Korea.

32051121",Associations of cognitive performance with cardiovascular magnetic resonance phenotypes in the UK Biobank.,"Existing evidence suggests links between brain and cardiovascular health. We investigated associations between cognitive performance and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phenotypes in the UK Biobank, considering a range of potential confounders.
We studied 29 763 participants with CMR and cognitive testing, specifically, fluid intelligence (FI, 13 verbal-numeric reasoning questions), and reaction time (RT, a timed pairs matching exercise); both were considered continuous variables for modelling. We included the following CMR metrics: left and right ventricular (LV and RV) volumes in end-diastole and end-systole, LV/RV ejection fractions, LV/RV stroke volumes, LV mass, and aortic distensibility. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the association of each CMR measure with FI and RT, adjusting for age, sex, smoking, education, deprivation, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, alcohol intake, and exercise level. We report standardized beta-coefficients, 95% confidence intervals, and P-values adjusted for multiple testing. In this predominantly healthy cohort (average age 63.0 ± 7.5 years), better cognitive performance (higher FI, lower RT) was associated with larger LV/RV volumes, higher LV/RV stroke volumes, greater LV mass, and greater aortic distensibility in fully adjusted models. There was some evidence of non-linearity in the relationship between FI and LV end-systolic volume, with reversal of the direction of association at very high volumes. Associations were consistent for men and women and in different ages.

385,33978303,Hospital readmissions following infections in dementia: a nationwide and registry-based cohort study.,"We aimed to investigate readmission risks following infections in dementia, identify the types of infections behind the risks, and highlight the reasons for readmissions.
Acute inpatient hospital admissions for infections in Danish residents were included from 1 January 2000, or age 65 years. Primary outcomes were 7-day readmissions risk ratios (RRs; risk following infection index admissions of people with dementia relative to those without dementia), risks by infection site, and reasons for readmission. Secondary outcomes were 30- and 90-day readmission risks. Competing risk of death was estimated.
Seven-day readmission RR was increased in all age groups and was highest in the youngest patients (women RR: 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.53; men RR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.35). RRs decreased with increasing age and longer follow-up. The most notable common readmissions were for infections and dehydration in dementia.
We conclude that there is a substantially increased readmission risk in people with dementia than in those without dementia, particularly within 7 days, and for the youngest in the cohort. Readmission risks were higher for infection index admissions than for admissions for causes other than infection, and readmissions were mostly due to infections. Our findings highlight the burden of infections in people with dementia and call for in-depth investigations of determinants related to readmission risks, to inform public policy and identify avenues for interventions that can decrease or prevent potentially avoidable readmissions.","['dementia', 'infection', 'nationwide cohort', 'readmission', 'registry-based']",European journal of neurology,2021-05-13,"[{'lastname': 'Janbek', 'firstname': 'Janet', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Danish Dementia Research Centre, Section 8007, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Frimodt-Møller', 'firstname': 'Niels', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Laursen', 'firstname': 'Thomas Munk', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Economics and Business Economics, National Centre for Register-based Research, Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University, Aarhus V, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Waldemar', 'firstname': 'Gunhild', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Danish Dementia Research Centre, Section 8007, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]",,,"Seven-day readmission RR was increased in all age groups and was highest in the youngest patients (women RR: 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.53; men RR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.35).

16796770","Risk Factors for Falls in Patients with Alzheimer Disease: A Retrospective Study of Balance, Cognition, and Visuospatial Ability.","This study aimed to determine the main risk factors for falls in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) by comparing balance, cognition, and visuospatial ability between those who have experienced a fall and those who have not.
Forty-seven AD patients were admitted to a ward for patients with dementia (22 men and 25 women). The balance of patients was evaluated using the Functional Reach Test (FRT), the one-leg standing duration, and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. The Mini-Mental State Examination-Japanese (MMSE-J) was used to evaluate cognition. For visuospatial ability assessment, the Clock-Drawing Test (CDT) as well as overlapping figure identification and shape discrimination in the Visual Perception Test for Agnosia (VPTA) were used. The patients were allocated to either the fall group or the nonfall group based on their history of falls in the past year. The relationships between patients' characteristics and evaluation outcomes were compared and examined. Logistic regression analysis was performed using a fall as the objective variable. The area under the curve (AUC) and the cutoff value were calculated.
Of the 47 participants, 22 had experienced falls within the past year (46.8%). The results of the FRT, one-leg standing duration, the TUG, the CDT, and the VPTA were significantly lower in the fall group. No significant difference between the MMSE-J scores of the fall group and those of the nonfall group was observed. The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that falls in AD patients were significantly associated with the FRT. It was found that a shorter FRT distance (cm) had a significant impact on falls. For the FRT, the fall-related AUC was 0.755. At a cutoff value of 24.5 cm, the level of sensitivity was 68.0%, and the level of specificity was 77.3%.
The findings of this study indicate that balance and visuospatial abilities are risks factors for falls in AD patients. In contrast, cognitive impairment was not a risk factor for falls. It was demonstrated that the FRT could be an appropriate risk predictor for falls in AD patients. In particular, falls in AD patients were strongly affected by a reduced dynamic balance.","['Alzheimer disease', 'Cutoff', 'Fall', 'Functional reach test']",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders extra,2021-05-13,"[{'lastname': 'Oki', 'firstname': 'Mayuka', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsumoto', 'firstname': 'Miyuki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center, Koto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshikawa', 'firstname': 'Yukiko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center, Koto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fukushima', 'firstname': 'Mitsuko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center, Koto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nagasawa', 'firstname': 'Akira', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Juntendo University Koshigaya Hospital, Koshigaya, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takakura', 'firstname': 'Tomokazu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center, Koto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Yukiko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Occupational Therapy, Kyorin University, Mitaka, Japan.'}]",,,"Of the 47 participants, 22 had experienced falls within the past year (46.8%).

29769374",Bone Mineral Density Measurements and Association With Brain Structure and Cognitive Function: The Framingham Offspring Cohort.,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is a potential surrogate marker of lifetime estrogen exposure previously linked to increased risk of Alzheimer dementia among elderly women. We examine the association between BMD in the ""young old"" with imaging biomarkers of brain aging and cognitive performance.
Offspring participants (N=1905, mean age 66) of a population-based cohort who had BMD, brain imaging and detailed cognitive assessment were included in the study. Sex-stratified, linear, and logistic regression models were used for analysis.
Higher femoral neck BMD was associated with lower white matter hyperintensity burden and better performance on Trails B-A in both sexes, even after adjustment for cerebrovascular risk factors. Among women, the positive association with Trails B-A performance was seen only in APOE4 allele carriers. Higher BMD measurements were linked to better visual reproductions test performance in men. Finally, among women, higher femoral trochanter BMD was associated with better logical memory and Hooper visual organization test performance.

389,33964140,Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of dementia: observational and genetic studies.,"The association of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol with risk of dementia is unclear. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that high levels of plasma HDL cholesterol are associated with increased risk of dementia and whether a potential association is of a causal nature.
In two prospective population-based studies, the Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study (N = 111 984 individuals), we first tested whether high plasma HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of any dementia and its subtypes. These analyses in men and women separately were adjusted multifactorially for other risk factors including apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Second, taking advantage of two-sample Mendelian randomization, we tested whether genetically elevated HDL cholesterol was causally associated with Alzheimer's disease using publicly available consortia data on 643 836 individuals. Observationally, multifactorially adjusted Cox regression restricted cubic spline models showed that both men and women with extreme high HDL cholesterol concentrations had increased risk of any dementia and of Alzheimer's disease. Men in the 96th-99th and 100th vs. the 41st-60th percentiles of HDL cholesterol had multifactorially including APOE genotype adjusted hazard ratios of 1.66 (95% confidence interval 1.30-2.11) and 2.00 (1.35-2.98) for any dementia and 1.59 (1.16-2.20) and 1.87 (1.11-3.16) for Alzheimer's disease. Corresponding estimates for women were 0.94 (0.74-1.18) and 1.45 (1.03-2.05) for any dementia and 0.94 (0.70-1.26) and 1.69 (1.13-2.53) for Alzheimer's disease. Genetically, the two-sample Mendelian randomization odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease per 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol was 0.92 (0.74-1.10) in the IGAP2019 consortium and 0.98 (0.95-1.00) in the ADSP/IGAP/PGC-ALZ/UKB consortium. Similar estimates were observed in sex stratified analyses.
High plasma HDL cholesterol was observationally associated with increased risk of any dementia and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that HDL cholesterol can be used as an easily accessible plasma biomarker for individual risk assessment.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Dementia', 'General population', 'HDL cholesterol', 'Risk prediction']",Cardiovascular research,2021-05-09,"[{'lastname': 'Kjeldsen', 'firstname': 'Emilie W', 'initials': 'EW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomassen', 'firstname': 'Jesper Q', 'initials': 'JQ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Juul Rasmussen', 'firstname': 'Ida', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Nordestgaard', 'firstname': 'Børge G', 'initials': 'BG', 'affiliation': 'The Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen City Heart Study, Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Biochemistry, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2730, Herlev, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Tybjærg-Hansen', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen City Heart Study, Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Frikke-Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]",,"High plasma HDL cholesterol was observationally associated with increased risk of any dementia and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that HDL cholesterol can be used as an easily accessible plasma biomarker for individual risk assessment.",,"Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

32986671",The role of sex and gender in the selection of Alzheimer patients for clinical trial pre-screening.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly with a prevalence of 7.1% in women and 3.3% in men. Sex-related patterns have been reported in prognosis, biomarker status, and risk factors. Despite this, the interaction of sex has received limited attention, with AD trials persistently recruiting lower numbers of women than the population distribution and a lack of information on the sex-disaggregated effects of anti-dementia therapies. This is the first study aiming to identify the role of sex in the selection for screening in AD clinical trials.
This cross-sectional study provides a comprehensive analysis of screening eligibility according to a set of pre-selection criteria currently applied at Fundació ACE memory clinic for a more efficient trial screening process. A cohort of 6667 women and 2926 men diagnosed with AD dementia (55%) or mild cognitive impairment (45%) was analyzed. We also assessed the frequencies of men and women effectively screened for trial enrolment over a period of 10 years. Additionally, data from AddNeuroMed study was used to explore trends in eligibility based on the education criteria.
Women showed a significantly lower chance of being eligible for screening than men (OR = 1.26; p < 0.01). This imbalance was confirmed by a lower frequency of women screened for enrolment compared to the study population (63.0% vs. 69.5%). Education was revealed as the key criterion contributing to this unbalance, with men showing over twice the chance of being screened compared with women (OR = 2.25, p < 0.01). Education-based differences were greater in earlier born patients, but the gap narrowed and achieved balance with increasing year of birth. This observation was replicated using data from other European populations included in AddNeuroMed study. Comorbidity was the most limiting criterion with sex differences in frequencies and significant discrimination against the selection of men (OR = 0.86, p < 0.01).
The large number of low-educated elderly women with AD demands for a sex-focused approach in clinical research. New assessment tools insensitive to education level should be developed to enable a proportional representation of women. Although this gender education gap is mostly inexistent in developed countries, economic or cultural factors may lead to different scenarios in other regions. Overlooking the impact of sex may lead to a handicap in AD research with a direct adverse impact on women's health.","['Aging', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Gender', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Sex', 'Women']",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2021-05-07,"[{'lastname': 'Rosende-Roca', 'firstname': 'Maitee', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Center and Memory Clinic.

This imbalance was confirmed by a lower frequency of women screened for enrolment compared to the study population (63.0% vs. 69.5%). Education was revealed as the key criterion contributing to this unbalance, with men showing over twice the chance of being screened compared with women (OR = 2.25, p < 0.01). Education-based differences were greater in earlier born patients, but the gap narrowed and achieved balance with increasing year of birth. This observation was replicated using data from other European populations included in AddNeuroMed study. Comorbidity was the most limiting criterion with sex differences in frequencies and significant discrimination against the selection of men (OR = 0.86, p < 0.01).",,"10.1186/s13195-021-00833-4

25499429",Risk factors and consequences of depression in later life: Findings from the health in men study (HIMS).,"The Health In Men Study (HIMS) has been collecting data on risk factors and health events for the past 25 years in a large community-representative sample of older men. This paper summarises key-findings of the study about depression in later life.
Narrative review of selected HIMS studies published over the past 15 years describing risk factors associated with prevalent and incident depression in older men, as well as clinical outcomes associated with depression.
Data from HIMS showed that cardiovascular diseases and risk factors are associated with increased risk of depression, but this association is neither specific nor causative. Findings from HIMS are not supportive of the vascular hypothesis of depression in later life. Studies investigating lifestyle have generated risk tables capable of guiding risk reduction strategies. Other potentially modifiable risk factors associated with depression in the HIMS cohort included abnormal allostatic inflammatory response, high plasma homocysteine and low testosterone. The results from HIMS also showed that depression is most likely a prodromal manifestation of dementia rather that a true risk factor, but it increases frailty and mortality. The association between depression and suicide in older men is largely mediated by deteriorating health and increasing frailty.
HIMS has contributed to advance knowledge about risk factors associated with depression, as well as the health consequences of depression in older men. The study is ongoing and the investigators welcome the opportunity to share data with colleagues who are interested in the health of older people.","['Alcohol', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Comorbidity', 'Depression', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diabetes', 'Epidemiology', 'Falls', 'Fractures', 'Frailty', 'Homocysteine', 'Inflammation', 'Mortality', 'Obesity', 'Physical activity', 'Risk factors', 'Smoking', 'Stroke', 'Testosterone', 'Vitamin D']",Aging brain,2021-05-03,"[{'lastname': 'Almeida', 'firstname': 'Osvaldo P', 'initials': 'OP', 'affiliation': 'WA Centre for Health & Ageing, Medical School, University of Western Australia, Australia.'}]",,"HIMS has contributed to advance knowledge about risk factors associated with depression, as well as the health consequences of depression in older men.

24062287",Age and sex specific effects of APOE genotypes on ischemic heart disease and its risk factors in the UK Biobank.,"APOE genotypes are associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD), several other cardiovascular diseases and dementia. Previous studies have not comprehensively considered all genotypes, especially ε2ε2, nor associations by age and sex, although IHD incidence differs by sex. In the UK Biobank, including 391,992 white British participants, we compared effects of APOE genotypes on IHD and its risk factors. Compared to the ε3ε3 genotype, ε2ε2 was not clearly associated with IHD but was associated with lower plasma apolipoprotein B (apoB). The ε2ε3 genotype conferred lower IHD risk, systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse pressure and plasma apoB than ε3ε3. ε3ε4 and ε4ε4 conferred higher IHD risk, higher pulse pressure and plasma apoB, but lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) than ε3ε3. The associations by age and sex were fairly similar, except ε2ε2 compared to ε3ε3 was marginally positively associated with IHD in the younger age group and nominally inversely associated with SBP in men. ε3ε4 compared to ε3ε3 was nominally positively associated with SBP in women. APOE genotypes affect IHD risk increasingly from ε2ε3, ε3ε3, ε3ε4 to ε4ε4, with similar patterns for pulse pressure and plasma apoB, but not for diabetes. Associations with blood pressure differed by sex. Greater understanding of products of APOE and their effects might generate targets of intervention.",[],Scientific reports,2021-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Mengyu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, 1/F, Patrick Manson Building (North Wing), 7 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Jie V', 'initials': 'JV', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, 1/F, Patrick Manson Building (North Wing), 7 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwok', 'firstname': 'Man Ki', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, 1/F, Patrick Manson Building (North Wing), 7 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Schooling', 'firstname': 'C Mary', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, 1/F, Patrick Manson Building (North Wing), 7 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. cms1@hku.hk.\nGraduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, City University of New York, New York, NY, 10017, USA. cms1@hku.hk.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-021-88256-x

2297854",Sex Difference in the Risk of Dementia in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the risk factors for dementia. Female sex is an inconsistent risk factor for dementia after adjusting for age in the general population, and there lacks research on its impact in developing dementia in patients with AF. This paper aims to investigate whether female sex is a risk factor for dementia in AF patients. Data of patients with newly diagnosed AF between 2001-2013 were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Exclusion criteria were: patients with incomplete demographic data, age < 20 years, rheumatic heart disease, hyperthyroidism, past valvular heart surgery, and a history of dementia. Propensity score matching (PSM) between sexes was performed, including comorbidities, medications and index date stratified by age. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of dementia at follow-up. A total of 117,517 men and 156,705 women were eligible for analysis. After 1:1 PSM, both 100,065 men and women (aged 72.5 ± 12.5 years) were included for analysis. Dementia risk varied with age in women compared with men. The difference was negligible for ≤55 years (sub distribution HR (SHR) = 0.89, 95% CI 0.73-1.07), but increased between 56-65 years (SHR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25), 66-75 years (SHR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.09-1.20), 75-85 years (SHR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.15) and >85 years (SHR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.16) for females. This study establishes that female sex increases the risk of developing dementia compared to male sex in AF patients aged >56 years. However, the impact of female sex on dementia in AF patients differs between dementia types.","['atrial fibrillation', 'burden of atrial high-rate episodes', 'cardiac remodeling', 'circadian clock genes', 'circadian rhythm']","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yung-Lung', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology and Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Hui-Ting', 'initials': 'HT', 'affiliation': 'Emergency Department, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Ya-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chong', 'firstname': 'Shaur-Zheng', 'initials': 'SZ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology and Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsueh', 'firstname': 'Shukai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology and Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 83301, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Chang-Ming', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi 61363, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Yu-Sheng', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan.\nDivision of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi 61363, Taiwan.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/diagnostics11050760

25265141",Association Between Age at Diabetes Onset and Subsequent Risk of Dementia.,"Trends in type 2 diabetes show an increase in prevalence along with younger age of onset. While vascular complications of early-onset type 2 diabetes are known, the associations with dementia remains unclear.
To determine whether younger age at diabetes onset is more strongly associated with incidence of dementia.
Population-based study in the UK, the Whitehall II prospective cohort study, established in 1985-1988, with clinical examinations in 1991-1993, 1997-1999, 2002-2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013, and 2015-2016, and linkage to electronic health records until March 2019. The date of final follow-up was March 31, 2019.
Type 2 diabetes, defined as a fasting blood glucose level greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL at clinical examination, physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, use of diabetes medication, or hospital record of diabetes between 1985 and 2019.
Incident dementia ascertained through linkage to electronic health records.
Among 10 095 participants (67.3% men; aged 35-55 years in 1985-1988), a total of 1710 cases of diabetes and 639 cases of dementia were recorded over a median follow-up of 31.7 years. Dementia rates per 1000 person-years were 8.9 in participants without diabetes at age 70 years, and rates were 10.0 per 1000 person-years for participants with diabetes onset up to 5 years earlier, 13.0 for 6 to 10 years earlier, and 18.3 for more than 10 years earlier. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, compared with participants without diabetes at age 70, the hazard ratio (HR) of dementia in participants with diabetes onset more than 10 years earlier was 2.12 (95% CI, 1.50-3.00), 1.49 (95% CI, 0.95-2.32) for diabetes onset 6 to 10 years earlier, and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.70-1.76) for diabetes onset 5 years earlier or less; linear trend test (P < .001) indicated a graded association between age at onset of type 2 diabetes and dementia. At age 70, every 5-year younger age at onset of type 2 diabetes was significantly associated with an HR of dementia of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.06-1.46) in analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and health-related measures.

34275906",Investigation of Autosomal Genetic Sex Differences in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Men are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to women with European ancestry. Over the years, genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however, it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex-specific manner.
In an effort to study sex-specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored 2 large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases, and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta-analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.
In total, 19 genomewide significant regions were identified and no sex-specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWAS were identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~ 20%).
We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females cases at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus female patients.

396,33882722,Herpes Zoster Does Not Increase the Risk of Neurodegenerative Dementia: A Case-Control Study.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the association between neurodegenerative dementia and herpes zoster infection (HZI) using a national sample cohort.
From the national cohort study conducted by the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we extracted data for patients with neurodegenerative dementia and for 1:4 matched control participants and searched the patient histories for HZI.
The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for HZI was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.84-0.97) in the dementia group. According to the subgroup analysis, the adjusted OR for HZI was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 -1.00) in the < 80 years old group, 0.88 (95% CI = 0.78 -1.00) in the ≥ 80 years old group, 0.77 (95% CI = 0.66-0.89) in men and 0.96 (95% CI = 0.88 -1.05) in women.
We concluded that HZI does not increase the risk of neurodegenerative dementia in individuals of any age or of either sex.","['cohort study', 'dementia', 'epidemiology', 'herpes zoster', 'nested case-control study']",American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,2021-04-23,"[{'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Hyo Geun', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.\nHallym Data Science Laboratory, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Bum Jung', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Jae Sung', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, 158781Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Sim', 'firstname': 'Song Yong', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics and Institute of Statistics, 26727Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Yoon Jung', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 158781Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Suk Woo', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 158781Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.'}]",,,"The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for HZI was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.84-0.97) in the dementia group.

33170261",Effect of Sodium Benzoate on Cognitive Function Among Patients With Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Female gender is a major risk factor for dementia; however, gender has not yet been adequately addressed by clinical trials. A recent study demonstrated that sodium benzoate, a D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, improved cognitive function in early-phase Alzheimer disease.
To examine the potential gender difference in the effects of benzoate treatment on the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).
This post hoc secondary analysis used data from a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 3 major medical centers in Taiwan and enrolled 97 patients with BPSD. Data were analyzed between February 2014 and November 2017.
Six weeks of treatment of 250 to 1500 mg/d of sodium benzoate or placebo.
The primary outcome measures were Alzheimer disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) scores.
Among 97 total participants (62 [64%] women; mean [SD] age, 75.4 [7.7] years), 49 patients (30 women and 19 men) were randomized to sodium benzoate, and 48 (32 women and 16 men) were randomized to placebo. Among 62 women, 6-week benzoate treatment significantly surpassed placebo in the effects on ADAS-cog performance (mean [SD] difference in score between baseline and end point, -3.1 [6.4] points vs 0 [4.5] points; Cohen d = 0.56; P = .04) but not BEHAVE-AD performance. In contrast, among 35 men, the 2 treatment groups did not differ significantly in both ADAS-cog and BEHAVE-AD scores. Compared with placebo, benzoate treatment also increased estradiol to follicle-stimulating hormone ratios among women (mean [SD] difference between baseline and end point, 0 [0.2] vs -0.1 [0.3]; P = .03).
These findings suggest that benzoate treatment may improve cognitive function in women with later-phase dementia. In the future, longer dose-finding trials are warranted to further clarify the efficacy of benzoate for later-phase dementia and investigate the role of sex hormones and other factors in the pathogenesis of dementia.

15033247",Autonomic Imbalance and Risk of Dementia and Stroke: The Framingham Study.,"The autonomic nervous system has been implicated in stroke and dementia pathophysiology. High resting heart rate and low heart rate variability indicate the effect of autonomic imbalance on the heart. We examined the associations of resting heart rate and heart rate variability with incident stroke and dementia in a community-based cohort of middle- and old-aged adults.
The study sample included 1581 participants aged >60 years and 3271 participants aged >45 years evaluated for incident dementia and stroke, respectively, who participated in the Framingham Offspring cohort third (1983–1987) examination and had follow-up for neurology events after the seventh (1998–2001) examination. Heart rate variability was assessed through the standard deviation (SD) of normal-to-normal RR intervals and the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats from 2-hour Holter monitor. Participants were followed-up for stroke and dementia incidence from exam 7 to a maximum of 10 years. Cox regression models were used to assess the link of resting heart rate and heart rate variability with stroke and dementia risk while adjusting for potential confounders, and interactions with age and sex were assessed.
Of the dementia (mean age, 55±6 years, 46% men) and stroke (mean age, 48±9 years, 46% men) samples, 133 and 127 developed dementia and stroke, respectively, during the follow-up. Overall, autonomic imbalance was not associated with dementia risk. However, age modified the associations such that SD of normal-to-normal intervals and root mean square of successive differences were associated with dementia risk in older people (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI] per 1SD, 0.61 [0.38–0.99] and HR [95% CI] per 1SD, 0.34 [0.15–0.74], respectively). High resting heart rate was associated with increased stroke risk (HR [95% CI] per 10 bpm, 1.18 [1.01–1.39]), and high SD of normal-to-normal intervals was associated with lower stroke risk in men (HR [95% CI] per 1SD, 0.46 [0.26–0.79]) but not women (HR [95% CI] per 1SD, 1.25 [0.88–1.79]; P for interaction=0.003).
Some measures of cardiac autonomic imbalance may precede dementia and stroke occurrence, particularly in older ages and men, respectively.","['aged', 'atrial fibrillation', 'dementia', 'heart rate', 'risk factors', 'stroke']",Stroke,2021-04-21,"[{'lastname': 'Weinstein', 'firstname': 'Galit', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, University of Haifa, Israel (G.W.).'}, {'lastname': 'Davis-Plourde', 'firstname': 'Kendra', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, MA (K.D.-P., A.S.B.).\nThe Framingham Study, MA (K.D.-P., A.S.B., S.S.).'}, {'lastname': 'Beiser', 'firstname': 'Alexa S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, MA (K.D.-P., A.S.B.).\nThe Framingham Study, MA (K.D.-P., A.S.B., S.S.).\nDepartment of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, MA (A.S.B., S.S.).'}, {'lastname': 'Seshadri', 'firstname': 'Sudha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""The Framingham Study, MA (K.D.-P., A.S.B., S.S.).\nDepartment of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, MA (A.S.B., S.S.).\nGlenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio (S.S.).""}]",,,"Of the dementia (mean age, 55±6 years, 46% men) and stroke (mean age, 48±9 years, 46% men) samples, 133 and 127 developed dementia and stroke, respectively, during the follow-up.

26397878",The Relationship Between Cognitive Performance Using Tests Assessing a Range of Cognitive Domains and Future Dementia Diagnosis in a British Cohort: A Ten-Year Prospective Study.,"Exploring the domains of cognitive function which are most strongly associated with future dementia may help with understanding risk factors for, and the natural history of dementia.
To examine the association of performance on a range of cognitive tests (both global and domain specific) with subsequent diagnosis of dementia through health services in a population of relatively healthy men and women and risk of future dementia.
We examined the association between performance on different cognitive tests as well as a global score and future dementia risk ascertained through health record linkage in a cohort of 8,581 individuals (aged 48-92 years) between 2004-2019 with almost 15 years follow-up (average of 10 years) before and after adjustment for socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health characteristics.
Those with poor performance for global cognition (bottom 10%) were almost four times as likely to receive a dementia diagnosis from health services over the next 15 years than those who performed well HR = 3.51 (95% CI 2.61, 4.71 p < 0.001) after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and biological factors and also prevalent disease. Poor cognition performance in multiple tests was associated with 10-fold increased risk compared to those not performing poorly in any test HR = 10.82 (95% CI 6.85, 17.10 p < 0.001).
Deficits across multiple cognitive domains substantially increase risk of future dementia over and above neuropsychological test scores ten years prior to a clinical diagnosis. These findings may help further understanding of the natural history of dementia and how such measures could contribute to strengthening future models of dementia.","['Cognition', 'dementia', 'epidemiology', 'risk']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021-04-20,"[{'lastname': 'Hayat', 'firstname': 'Shabina A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Luben', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Khaw', 'firstname': 'Kay-Tee', 'initials': 'KT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Brayne', 'firstname': 'Carol', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}]",,Deficits across multiple cognitive domains substantially increase risk of future dementia over and above neuropsychological test scores ten years prior to a clinical diagnosis.

9777903",Sex differences in brain aging among adults with family history of Alzheimer's disease and APOE4 genetic risk.,"Emerging evidence suggests that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk factors may differentially contribute to disease trajectory in women than men. Determining the effect of AD risk factors on brain aging in women, compared to men, is critical for understanding whether there are sex differences in the pathways towards AD in cognitively intact but at-risk adults. Brain Age Gap (BAG) is a concept used increasingly as a measure of brain health; BAG is defined as the difference between predicted age (based on structural MRI) and chronological age, with negative values reflecting preserved brain health with age. Using BAG, we investigated whether there were sex differences in the brain effects of AD risk factors (i.e., family history of AD, and carrying an apolipoprotein E ε4 allele [+APOE4]) in cognitively intact adults, and if this relationship was moderated by modifiable factors (i.e. body mass index [BMI], blood pressure and physical activity). We undertook a cross-sectional study of structural MRIs from 1067 cognitively normal adults across four neuroimaging datasets. An elastic net regression model found that women with a family history of AD and +APOE4 genotype had more advanced brain aging than their male counterparts. In a sub-cohort of women with those risk factors, higher BMI was associated with less brain aging whereas lower BMI was not. In a sub-cohort of women and men with +APOE4, engaging in physical activity was more beneficial to men's brain aging than women's. Our results demonstrate that AD risk factors are associated with greater brain aging in women than men, although there may be more unexplored modifiable factors that influence this relationship. These findings suggest that the complex interplay between unmodifiable and modifiable AD risk factors can potentially protect against brain aging in women and men.","['APOE', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Brain aging', 'Family history']",NeuroImage.

28025715",Alzheimer's pathogenic mechanisms and underlying sex difference.,"AD is a neurodegenerative disease, and its frequency is often reported to be higher for women than men: almost two-thirds of patients with AD are women. One prevailing view is that women live longer than men on average of 4.5 years, plus there are more women aged 85 years or older than men in most global subpopulations; and older age is the greatest risk factor for AD. However, the differences in the actual risk of developing AD for men and women of the same age is difficult to assess, and the findings have been mixed. An increasing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies as well as the complications in estimating incidence support the sex-specific biological mechanisms in diverging AD risk as an important adjunct explanation to the epidemiologic perspective. Although some of the sex differences in AD prevalence are due to differences in longevity, other distinct biological mechanisms increase the risk and progression of AD in women. These risk factors include (1) deviations in brain structure and biomarkers, (2) psychosocial stress responses, (3) pregnancy, menopause, and sex hormones, (4) genetic background (i.e., APOE), (5) inflammation, gliosis, and immune module (i.e., TREM2), and (6) vascular disorders. More studies focusing on the underlying biological mechanisms for this phenomenon are needed to better understand AD. This review presents the most recent data in sex differences in AD-the gateway to precision medicine, therefore, shaping expert perspectives, inspiring researchers to go in new directions, and driving development of future diagnostic tools and treatments for AD in a more customized way.","['Aging', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Estrogen', 'Gender difference', 'Hormones', 'Menopause']",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2021-04-13,"[{'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Donghui', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.

32117730",Rural-urban Disparities in the Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in Taiwan: A Door-to-door Nationwide Study.,"Screening or diagnosis for the elderly with dementia in rural regions might be delayed and underestimated due to limited utilization of healthcare resources. This study aimed to evaluate the disparities of prevalence and risk factors of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia between urban and rural residence.
In this nationwide door-to-door survey, 10,432 participants aged 65 years and more were selected through computerized random sampling from all administrative districts in Taiwan and were assessed using an in-person interview. We calculated the prevalence of MCI and dementia, with their risk factors examined using multivariable logistic regression.
The prevalence of dementia in rural, suburban, and urban areas among the elderly was 8.69% (95% CI, 8.68-8.69), 6.63% (95% CI, 6.62-6.63), and 4.46% (95% CI, 4.46-4.47), respectively. A similar rural-suburban-urban gradient relationship on the dementia prevalence was observed in any age and sex group. The rural:urban ratio was higher in women than in men for both MCI and dementia. Urbanization remained to be an independent factor for both MCI and dementia after adjustment for age, gender, education, lifestyle, and health status. The beneficial effects of exercise on dementia were more evident in rural areas than in urban ones.
Significantly higher prevalence of MCI and dementia were found in rural areas than in urban ones, especially for women. The odds of risk factors for MCI and dementia varied by urbanization status. Focus on the rural-urban inequality and the modification of associated factors specifically for different urbanization levels are needed.","['dementia', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'prevalence', 'risk factors', 'urbanization']",Journal of epidemiology,2021-04-13,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chih-Ching', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Healthcare Administration, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chien-Hui', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, En Chu Kong Hospital.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Huey-Jane', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': ""Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease Association.""}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Li-Yu', 'initials': 'LY', 'affiliation': ""Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease Association.""}, {'lastname': 'Chiu', 'firstname': 'Ming-Jang', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University.\nGraduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University.\nGraduate Institute of Psychology, College of Science, National Taiwan University.\nGraduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University.'}]",,"Significantly higher prevalence of MCI and dementia were found in rural areas than in urban ones, especially for women.

16361026",Association of sex differences in dementia risk factors with sex differences in memory decline in a population-based cohort spanning 20-76 years.,"Sex differences in late-life memory decline may be explained by sex differences in dementia risk factors. Episodic memory and dementia risk factors were assessed in young, middle-aged and older adults over 12 years in a population-based sample (N = 7485). For men in midlife and old age, physical, cognitive and social activities were associated with less memory decline, and financial hardship was associated with more. APOE e4 and vascular risk factors were associated with memory decline for women in midlife. Depression, cognitive and physical activity were associated with memory change in older women. Incident midlife hypertension (β = - 0.48, 95% CI - 0.87, - 0.09, p = 0.02) was associated with greater memory decline in women and incident late-life stroke accounted for greater memory decline in men (β = - 0.56, 95% CI - 1.12, - 0.01), p = 0.05). Women have fewer modifiable risk factors than men. Stroke and hypertension explained sex differences in memory decline for men and women respectively.",[],Scientific reports,2021-04-10,"[{'lastname': 'Anstey', 'firstname': 'Kaarin J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. k.anstey@unsw.edu.au.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, 139 Barker Street, Randwick, NSW, 2031, Australia. k.anstey@unsw.edu.au.\nCentre for Research on Ageing Health and Wellbeing, School of Population Health, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. k.anstey@unsw.edu.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Peters', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, 139 Barker Street, Randwick, NSW, 2031, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mortby', 'firstname': 'Moyra E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, 139 Barker Street, Randwick, NSW, 2031, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiely', 'firstname': 'Kim M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, 139 Barker Street, Randwick, NSW, 2031, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eramudugolla', 'firstname': 'Ranmalee', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, 139 Barker Street, Randwick, NSW, 2031, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cherbuin', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Research on Ageing Health and Wellbeing, School of Population Health, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Huque', 'firstname': 'Md Hamidul', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dixon', 'firstname': 'Roger A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.\nNeuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-021-86397-7

31494933",Neuroticism and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Neuroticism is linked to mood disorders and Alzheimer's disease, but fewer studies have tested the prospective association with Parkinson's disease (PD).
To examine the association between neuroticism and risk of PD in a large cohort and a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.
Participants from the UK Biobank (N = 490,755) completed a neuroticism scale in 2006-2010. Incident PD was ascertained using electronic health records or death records up to 2018. The systematic search and meta-analysis followed the MOOSE guidelines.
During 11.91 years of follow-up (mean = 8.88 years; 4,360,105 person-years) 1142 incident PD cases were identified. Neuroticism was associated with higher risk of incident PD, both as continuous (HR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.21-1.36) and categorical variable (top vs. bottom quartiles: HR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.60-2.22). The association remained significant after accounting for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, anxiety, and depressed mood, and after excluding cases that occurred within the first 5 years of follow-up. The associations were similar for women and men and across levels of socioeconomic status. Random-effect meta-analysis of four prospective studies (N = 548,284) found neuroticism associated with increased risk of incident PD (HR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.59-2.08; P = 7.31

9370237","HIV disease duration, but not active brain infection, predicts cortical amyloid beta deposition.","Abnormal deposition of the antimicrobial peptide amyloid beta (Aβ) is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to elucidate risk factors for brain Aβ in a cohort enriched for HIV and other neurotropic pathogens.
Cross-sectional cohort study.
We examined autopsy brains of 257 donors with a mean age of 52.8 years; 62% were men; and 194 were HIV+ and 63 HIV-. Hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) and Aβ were identified in frontal and temporal regions by immunohistochemistry. APOE genotyping was performed. Clinical and neuropathological predictors for Aβ were identified in univariate analyses, and then tested in multivariate regressions.
Cortical Aβ was identified in 32% of the sample, and active brain infection in 27%. Increased odds of Aβ were seen with increasing age and having an APOE ε4 allele; for the overall sample, HIV+ status was protective and brain infection was not a predictor. Within the HIV+ population, predictors for Aβ were duration of HIV disease and APOE alleles, but not age. When HIV disease duration and other HIV parameters were introduced into models for the entire sample, HIV disease duration was equivalent to age as a predictor of Aβ.
We hypothesize that dual aspects of immune suppression and stimulation in HIV, and beneficial survivor effects in older HIV+ individuals, account for HIV+ status decreasing, and HIV duration increasing, odds of Aβ. Importantly, with HIV, disease duration replaces age as an independent risk for Aβ, suggesting HIV-associated accelerated brain senescence.",[],"AIDS (London, England)",2021-04-05,"[{'lastname': 'Morgello', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology.\nDepartment of Neuroscience.\nDepartment of Pathology, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY.'}, {'lastname': 'Cortes', 'firstname': 'Etty P', 'initials': 'EP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY.'}, {'lastname': 'Gensler', 'firstname': 'Gary', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'The Emmes Company, Rockville, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Meloni', 'firstname': 'Gregory', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology.'}, {'lastname': 'Jacobs', 'firstname': 'Michelle M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology.'}, {'lastname': 'Murray', 'firstname': 'Jacinta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology.'}, {'lastname': 'Borukov', 'firstname': 'Valeriy', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY.'}, {'lastname': 'Crary', 'firstname': 'John F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience.\nDepartment of Pathology, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY.'}]",,"We hypothesize that dual aspects of immune suppression and stimulation in HIV, and beneficial survivor effects in older HIV+ individuals, account for HIV+ status decreasing, and HIV duration increasing, odds of Aβ.

23483644",Blood Pressure and Risk of Cognitive Impairment: The Role of Vascular Disease in Neurodegeneration.,"(1) Background: Both cerebral vascular disorders and cognitive decline increase in incidence with age. The role of cerebral vascular disease and hemodynamic changes in the development of cognitive deficits is controversial. The objective of this study was to assess the cardiovascular response during cardiac stress testing in neurologically asymptomatic individuals who developed cognitive impairment several years after previous cardiac stress testing. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent cardiac stress testing between January 2001 and December 2010. Patients were followed up until May 2015, and we selected those who developed cognitive dysfunction including dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and subjective cognitive decline, after the stress test. Heart rate and blood pressure both at rest and at peak exercise, and the mean R-R interval at rest were recorded. For each patient who developed cognitive impairment, we selected one matched control who did not show cognitive decline by the end of the follow-up period. (3) Results: From the cohort of 7224 patients, 371 developed cognitive impairment; of these, 186 (124 men) met the inclusion criteria, and 186 of the other patients were selected as matched controls. During follow-up, cognitive impairment appeared 6.2 ± 4.7 years after the cardiac stress test. These patients who had subsequently developed cognitive impairment had significantly lower at-rest systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure than controls (","['blood pressure', 'cardiac stress testing', 'cognitive impairment', 'dementia', 'heart rate', 'risk factors']",Brain sciences,2021-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Carmona-Abellan', 'firstname': 'Mar', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.\nNeurodegenerative Diseases Division, Health Research Institute Biocruces, 48903 Bizkaia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Trzeciak', 'firstname': 'Malwina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernández', 'firstname': 'Miriam Recio', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Echeveste', 'firstname': 'Beatriz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Imaz', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Luquin', 'firstname': 'Maria-Rosario', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.\nIdiSNA, Navarra Institute for Health Research, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Riverol', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.\nIdiSNA, Navarra Institute for Health Research, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/brainsci11030385

However, there is very little evidence to identify both baseline cognitive and occupational gender differences prior to older adults' retirement to design more efficient personalized cognitive interventions. This descriptive observational study examined gender differences in initial cognitive performance in 367 older adults with subjective memory complaints from a primary healthcare center in Zaragoza (Spain). To evaluate initial cognitive performance, the Spanish version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MEC-35) and the set test were used to measure verbal fluency. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated, and cognitive and occupational differences were analyzed per gender. Men had higher educational and occupational levels, were older and more of them were married (","['cardiovascular risk factors', 'cognitive impairment', 'gender difference', 'occupational level', 'subjective memory complaints']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Calatayud', 'firstname': 'Estela', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiatry and Nursing, Health Sciences Faculty, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Salavera', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Sociology, Education Faculty, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gómez-Soria', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiatry and Nursing, Health Sciences Faculty, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph18063106

We included 1587 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis with diabetes. We characterized eight diabetes subgroups according to absolute thresholds for disease characteristics: age at diabetes diagnosis (≤45 years), fasting glucose (FG ≥7.7 mmol/L; ≥140 mg/dL), and waist circumference (women ≥105 cm; men ≥110 cm). We estimated risk for mortality, incident cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, dementia, and retinopathy, respectively, over 17 years after adjustment for demographics, behavioral, clinical risk factors, and cohort attrition.
The subgroup with both high FG and early age at onset was associated with higher risk for death, CVD, heart failure, CKD, and retinopathy and the subgroup with both early age at onset and high waist circumference was associated CVD, heart failure, CKD, and retinopathy. The subgroup that met all three high-risk thresholds had greater risk for death, heart failure, CKD, and retinopathy. We did not observe evidence for synergistic or antagonistic joint effects of the high-risk characteristics for any outcome.
Our work supports differential risk for various diabetes complications among exclusive subgroups defined by age at diabetes onset, fasting glucose, and central adiposity.","['Death', 'Diabetes subgroups', 'Epidemiology', 'Incident complications', 'Joint effects', 'Multi-ethnic']",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2021-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bancks', 'firstname': 'Michael P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Wake Forest School of Medicine, Department of Epidemiology and Prevention, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.

The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial of 11,140 individuals with type 2 diabetes was used to estimate the odds of CD/dementia using multinomial logistic regression.
During a median 5-year follow-up, 1827 participants (43.2% women) had CD/dementia (1718 with CD only; 21 with dementia only; 88 with CD and dementia), and 929 (31.0% women) died without CD/dementia. Women had lower odds of CD/dementia than men (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval], 0.88 [0.77, 1.00]); older age, higher total cholesterol, HbA1c, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, moderately increased albumin-creatinine ratio, stroke/transient ischaemic attack and retinal disease were each associated with greater odds of CD/dementia; higher years at education completion, baseline cognitive function, taller stature and current alcohol use were inversely associated. Higher waist circumference (women-to-men ratio of ORs [ROR], 1.05 [1.00, 1.10] per 5 cm) and presence of anxiety/depression (ROR, 1.28 [1.01, 1.63]) were associated with greater ORs for CD/dementia in women than men.
Several risk factors were associated with CD/dementia. Higher waist circumference and mental health symptoms were more strongly associated with CD/dementia in women than men.

28472407",Risk of Suicide Attempt in Patients With Recent Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia.,"Little is known about the association between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and suicide. Most studies have focused on dementia and suicidal behavior, with inconsistent results.
To examine the association between diagnoses of MCI and dementia and suicide attempt and explore potential psychiatric moderators and to assess whether the association differs based on recency of diagnosis.
This nationwide cohort study integrated 5 national databases from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and included all VA medical centers in the US. US veterans 50 years or older with MCI diagnoses at baseline (October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2013) or earlier (October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2011) were propensity matched 1:3 with (1) patients with dementia diagnoses and (2) patients without either diagnosis based on demographic characteristics and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Diagnoses of MCI or dementia were defined as recent if there were no diagnosis codes before baseline. Data were analyzed from March 16, 2020, to January 15, 2021.
Information on suicide attempts through December 31, 2016, provided by the National Suicide Prevention Applications Network (nonfatal) and Mortality Data Repository (fatal).
The study population of 147 595 participants included 21 085 patients with MCI, 63 255 with dementia, and 63 255 in the propensity-matched comparison group. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74.7 (10.3) years, 143 353 (97.1%) were men, 4242 (2.9%) were women, and 127 065 (86.1%) were non-Hispanic White. A total of 138 patients with MCI (0.7%) and 400 patients with dementia (0.6%) attempted suicide during follow-up, compared with 253 patients without MCI or dementia (0.4%). Exploratory analyses revealed that no psychiatric comorbidity moderated the association between MCI or dementia and suicide attempt. After adjustment for demographic details and medical and psychiatric comorbidities, risk of suicide attempt was consistently highest for patients with a recent MCI or dementia diagnosis, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.34-2.22; P < .001) for recent MCI and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.17-1.77; P = .001) for recent dementia. Risk associated with prior diagnosis was not significant (HR for prior MCI, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.78-1.36; P = .84]; HR for prior dementia, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.95-1.36; P = .15]).
This study found that older adults with recent MCI or dementia diagnoses were at increased risk of attempting suicide. These findings suggest that involvement of supportive services at the time of or soon after diagnoses of MCI or dementia may help mitigate risk of suicide attempts.",[],JAMA psychiatry,2021-03-25,"[{'lastname': 'Günak', 'firstname': 'Mia Maria', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Deborah E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, California.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Yaffe', 'firstname': 'Kristine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, California.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.\nDepartment of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yixia', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Northern California Institute for Research and Education, The Veterans Health Research Institute, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Byers', 'firstname': 'Amy L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, California.\nDepartment of Medicine, Division of Geriatrics, University of California, San Francisco.'}]",,,"The study population of 147 595 participants included 21 085 patients with MCI, 63 255 with dementia, and 63 255 in the propensity-matched comparison group.

17664394",Developmental programming of offspring adipose tissue biology and obesity risk.,"Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions and imposes major negative health crises and an economic burden in both high and low income countries. The multifaceted nature of obesity represents a major health challenge, with obesity affecting a variety of different organs and increases the risk of many other noncommunicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. The defining organ of obesity is the adipose tissue, highlighting the need to more comprehensively understand the development and biology of this tissue to understand the pathogenesis of obesity. Adipose tissue is a miscellaneous and highly plastic endocrine organ. It comes in many different sizes and shades and is distributed throughout many different locations in the body. Though its development begins prenatally, quite uniquely, it has the capacity for unlimited growth throughout adulthood. Adipose tissue is also a highly sexually dimorphic tissue, patterning men and women in different ways, which means the risks associated with obesity are also sexually dimorphic. Recent studies show that environmental factors during prenatal and early stages of postnatal development have the capacity to programme the structure and function of adipose tissue, with implications for the development of obesity. This review summarizes the evidence for a role for early environmental factors, such as maternal malnutrition, hypoxia, and exposure to excess hormones and endocrine disruptors during gestation in the programming of adipose tissue and obesity in the offspring. We will also discuss the complexity of studying adipose tissue biology and the importance of appreciating nuances in adipose tissue, such as sexual dimorphism and divergent responses to metabolic and endocrine stimuli. Given the rising levels of obesity worldwide, understanding how environmental conditions in early life affects adipose tissue phenotype and the subsequent development of obesity is of absolute importance.",[],International journal of obesity (2005),2021-03-25,"[{'lastname': 'Rodgers', 'firstname': 'Amanda', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Trophoblast Research, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, Downing Street, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sferruzzi-Perri', 'firstname': 'Amanda N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Trophoblast Research, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, Downing Street, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. ans48@cam.ac.uk.'}]",,,,,10.1038/s41366-021-00790-w,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dde4cb30>,,,,,,
412,33752099,Social isolation and cognitive decline among older adults with depressive symptoms: prospective findings from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.,"Identifying potentially modifiable risk factors of cognitive decline among people with depressive symptoms could provide insight into strategies for improving treatment effect of depression and prevention of dementia. Quite a few studies have examined the association between social isolation and cognitive function directly among depressed older adults and the results are still mixed. The aim is to examine the association of social isolation and cognitive decline among older adults with depressive symptoms in a non-Western country.
This study used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Depressive symptoms were measured by the Chinese version of the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) (elevated depressive symptom cutoff≥10). Social isolation was assessed based on responses to four items: marital status, residence, contact with children, and social activity. Lagged dependent variable regressions adjusted for confounding factors were used to evaluate the association between baseline social isolation and follow-up cognitive function.
A number of 2,507 participants [mean age (SD)=61.37 (7.26); male, 41.0%] with increased depressive symptoms were available for the present study. Baseline social isolation was significantly associated with 4-year episodic memory (β=-0.08, p<0.001) in depressed women, but not men (β=-0.03, p=0.350). No significant association between baseline social isolation and follow-up mental status was found for women (β=-0.04, p=0.097) or men (β=0.01, p=0.741).
This longitudinal study found that social isolation was significantly associated with memory decline over 4 years among depressed women (but not men) in China.","['China', 'Cognitive decline', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Social isolation']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2021-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Lizhi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; Institute of Applied Psychology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Fengping', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Ningcan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'School of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; Institute of Applied Psychology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.

25274108",Marital loss and risk of dementia: Do race and gender matter?,"Recent studies have found that marital loss through divorce or widowhood is associated with a higher risk of dementia for older adults. However, whether these associations vary by race and gender is less clear. To address this gap, we drew upon longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (2000-2016) to investigate the association between marital loss and dementia risk, separately for non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks. We further examined gender variations in the link between marital loss and dementia risk within each racial group. Results from discrete-time event history models suggested that widowhood is significantly associated with a higher risk of dementia for both Whites and Blacks, controlling for basic demographic characteristics. However, while divorce is significantly associated with a higher risk of dementia for Blacks, the association is marginally significant (p < 0.1) for Whites. There are few significant gender variations in these associations except for the effect of divorce among Whites. Even after controlling for economic and health-related factors, we found that divorce is associated with a higher risk of dementia among White men but not among White women. Economic resources explain a significant portion of the association between widowhood and dementia risk, more so for Whites than for Blacks. Our findings call for more research into the pathways through which marital loss shapes the risk of dementia across racial and ethnic groups.","['Dementia', 'Divorce', 'Gender', 'Income', 'Marital status', 'Race', 'United States', 'Widowhood']",Social science & medicine (1982),2021-03-14,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Zhenmei', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sociology, Michigan State University, USA.

33109121",Cognitive Frailty and 30-Day Mortality in a National Cohort of Older Chinese Inpatients.,"Studies exploring the association of cognitive frailty and mortality have been mainly based on community settings or nursing home settings. The aim of our study was to explore the association between cognitive frailty and 30-day mortality among older Chinese inpatients.
A national cohort study was performed in different hospitals in China. A baseline survey was conducted from October 2018 and February 2019. Trained investigators collected the 30-day mortality. Cognitive impairment and frailty were defined by the Mini-Cog and FRAIL scale, respectively. Multivariate regression was used to explore the association between cognitive impairment and frailty status with 30-day mortality.
Of these participants, there were 3891 (41.91%) women and 5392 (58.09%) men, with an average age of 72.41 (SD=5.72). The prevalence of cognitive frailty was 5.44%. After adjusting for age, gender, education, depression and activities of daily living (ADL), the odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day mortality among inpatients were 3.43 (95% CI: 1.80-6.55) for cognitive frailty, 1.85 (95% CI: 1.01-3.41) for frailty only, and 1.43 (95% CI: 0.77-2.65) for cognitive impairment only compared to the reference group (neither frailty nor cognitive impairment). In addition, the discrimination of 30-day mortality was higher among patients with cognitive frailty (area under the curve =0.676 [95% CI: 0.621-0.731]) than either frailty (area under the curve =0.644 [95% CI: 0.594-0.694]) or cognitive impairment (area under the curve = 0.606 [95% CI: 0.556-0.655]) separately.

28108119",Evaluation of Selective Survival and Sex/Gender Differences in Dementia Incidence Using a Simulation Model.,"Dementia research is susceptible to bias arising from selective survival, a process that results in individuals with certain characteristics disproportionately surviving to old age. Spurious associations between risk factors and dementia may be induced when factors associated with longer survival also influence dementia incidence.
To assess the role of selective survival in explaining reported sex/gender differences in dementia incidence.
This decision analytical model used a simulated cohort of US participants aged 50 years and without dementia at baseline followed up for incident dementia through age 95 years. Selective survival was induced by a selection characteristic (eg, childhood social disadvantage or Alzheimer genetic risk) that influenced both mortality and dementia incidence at varying magnitudes. Data analysis was performed from April 2018 to May 2020.
Sex/gender, conceptualized as the combination of biological sex and social consequences of gender.
Dementia incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for women compared with men. In all simulations, it was assumed that there would be no true effect of sex/gender on dementia incidence; all observed sex/gender differences were due to selective survival.
At baseline, the simulation included 100 000 participants aged 50 years (51 000 [51%] women, mirroring the 1919-1921 US birth cohort of non-Latino White individuals at age 50 years); distributions of the selection characteristic were standard normal (mean [SD], 0.0 [1.0]). Observed sex/gender differences in dementia incidence in individuals aged 85 years or older ranged from insignificant (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91-1.11) to consistent with sex/gender differences (20% higher risk for women [IRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32]) reported in an extant study. Simulations in which bias was large enough to explain prior findings required moderate to large differential effects of selective survival (eg, hazard ratio for selection characteristic on mortality at least 2.0 among men, no effect among women).
These results suggest that selective survival may contribute to observed sex/gender differences in dementia incidence but do not preclude potential contributions of sex/gender-specific mechanisms. Further research on plausibility of selection characteristics with outcomes of the magnitude required for selective survival to explain sex/gender differences in dementia incidence and sex/gender-specific mechanisms represent an opportunity to understand prevention and treatment of dementia.",[],JAMA network open,2021-03-10,"[{'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'Crystal', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Fielding School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, University of California, Los Angeles.\nFielding School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayes-Larson', 'firstname': 'Eleanor', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Fielding School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Glymour', 'firstname': 'M Maria', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Dufouil', 'firstname': 'Carole', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Centre Inserm U1219, d'Epidémiologie et de Développement, Bordeaux School of Public Health, Institut de Santé Publique Université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.\nPole de sante publique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Hohman', 'firstname': 'Timothy J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': ""Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.\nVanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.""}, {'lastname': 'Whitmer', 'firstname': 'Rachel A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': ""Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of California, Davis.\nDepartment of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis.""}, {'lastname': 'Kobayashi', 'firstname': 'Lindsay C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor.'}, {'lastname': 'Brookmeyer', 'firstname': 'Ron', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Fielding School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Mayeda', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth Rose', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Fielding School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, University of California, Los Angeles.'}]",,,"At baseline, the simulation included 100 000 participants aged 50 years (51 000 [51%] women, mirroring the 1919-1921 US birth cohort of non-Latino White individuals at age 50 years); distributions of the selection characteristic were standard normal (mean [SD], 0.0 [1.0]).

Thus, we examined the relationship between prediabetes and AD-related biological and cognitive/clinical markers in a well-characterized sample drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Additionally, because women show higher rates of AD and generally more atherogenic lipid profiles than men, particularly in the context of diabetes, we examined whether sex moderates any observed associations. The total sample of 911 nondemented and non-diabetic participants [normal control = 540; mild cognitive impairment (MCI) = 371] included 391 prediabetic (fasting blood glucose: 100-125 mg/dL) and 520 normoglycemic individuals (age range: 55-91).

25447615",Mediterranean Diet and Risk of Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease in the EPIC-Spain Dementia Cohort Study.,"The Mediterranean diet (MD) has shown to reduce the occurrence of several chronic diseases. To evaluate its potential protective role on dementia incidence we studied 16,160 healthy participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain Dementia Cohort study recruited between 1992-1996 and followed up for a mean (±SD) of 21.6 (±3.4) years. A total of 459 incident cases of dementia were ascertained through expert revision of medical records. Data on habitual diet was collected through a validated diet history method to assess adherence to the relative Mediterranean Diet (rMED) score. Hazard ratios (HR) of dementia by rMED levels (low, medium and high adherence levels: ≤6, 7-10 and ≥11 points, respectively) were estimated using multivariable Cox models, whereas time-dependent effects were evaluated using flexible parametric Royston-Parmar (RP) models. Results of the fully adjusted model showed that high versus low adherence to the categorical rMED score was associated with a 20% (HR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.60-1.06) lower risk of dementia overall and HR of dementia was 8% (HR = 0.92, 0.85-0.99, ","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'EPIC-Spain', 'Mediterranean diet', 'cohort study', 'dementia', 'prospective analysis']",Nutrients,2021-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'Andreu-Reinón', 'firstname': 'María Encarnación', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Section of Neurology, Department of Internal Medicine, Rafael Méndez Hospital, Murcia Health Service, 30813 Lorca, Murcia, Spain.\nMurcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), 30120 Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Chirlaque', 'firstname': 'María Dolores', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), 30120 Murcia, Spain.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Murcia Regional Health Council, 30008 Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Health and Social Sciences, University of Murcia, 30100 Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gavrila', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), 30120 Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nMurcia Health Service, 30100 Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Amiano', 'firstname': 'Pilar', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'CIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nPublic Health Division of Gipuzkoa, Basque Government, 20013 Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain.\nBiodonostia Health Research Institute, 20014 San Sebastián, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mar', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Biodonostia Health Research Institute, 20014 San Sebastián, Spain.\nClinical Management Unit, OSI Alto Deba, 20500 Arrasate-Mondragón, Spain.\nAP-OSIs Gipuzkoa Research Unit, OSI Alto Deba, 20500 Arrasate-Mondragón, Spain.\nHealth Services Research Network on Chronic Patients (REDISSEC), 48902 Bilbao, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Tainta', 'firstname': 'Mikel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'CITA Alzheimer Foundation, 20019 Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain.\nNeurology Service, OSI Goierri-Alto Urola, 20700 Zumárraga, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ardanaz', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'CIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nPublic Health Institute of Navarra, IdiSNA, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Larumbe', 'firstname': 'Rosa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Public Health Institute of Navarra, IdiSNA, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.\nNeuroepigenetics Laboratory, Navarrabiomed, Public University of Navarre (UPNA), 31008 Pamplona, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurology, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Colorado-Yohar', 'firstname': 'Sandra M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), 30120 Murcia, Spain.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Murcia Regional Health Council, 30008 Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nResearch Group on Demography and Health, National Faculty of Public Health, University of Antioquia, Medellín 050010, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Navarro-Mateu', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), 30120 Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), 28029 Madrid, Spain.\nUnidad de Docencia, Investigación y Formación en Salud Mental (UDIF-SM), Servicio Murciano de Salud, 30120 Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Navarro', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), 30120 Murcia, Spain.\nDepartment of Health and Social Sciences, University of Murcia, 30100 Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Huerta', 'firstname': 'José María', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), 30120 Murcia, Spain.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Murcia Regional Health Council, 30008 Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/nu13020700

25208114",Cuba's cardiovascular risk factors: International comparison of levels and education gradients.,"Cuba's life expectancy at 79 is third highest in Latin America. Many attribute this to social investments in health and education, but comparative research is sparse, thus we compare Cuba with neighboring Dominican Republic, Costa Rica due to its strong social protections, and the U.S. Given high cardiovascular mortality, we focus on cardiovascular risk factor levels. To assess the role of health care, we distinguish medically amenable biomarkers from behavioral risk factors. To assess the role of Cuba's focus on equity, we compare education gradients in risk factors.
We analyze Cuban data from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group baseline survey of urban adults ages 65 plus. Comparison samples are drawn from the Dominican Republic 10/66 survey, the Costa Rican CRELES, and U.S. NHANES. We analyze cross-country levels and education gradients of medically amenable (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, access to health care) and behavioral (smoking, obesity) risk factors,-using sex-stratified weighted means comparisons and age-adjusted logistic regression.
Neither medically amenable nor behavioral risk factors are uniformly better in Cuba than comparison countries. Obesity is lower in Cuba, but male smoking is higher. Hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia levels are high in all countries, though Cuba's are lower than Costa Rica. Hypertension awareness in Cuba is similar to Costa Rica. Cuba has a higher proportion of hypertensives on treatment than Costa Rica, though lower than the U.S. Comparative gradients by education are similarly mixed. For behavioral factors, Cuba shows the strongest gradients (primarily for men) among the countries compared: smoking improves, but obesity worsens with education. Hypertension awareness also improves with education in Cuba, but Cuba shows no significant differences by education in hypertension treatment.
Smoking is comparatively high in Cuba, but obesity is low, and the resulting biomarkers show comparatively mixed patterns. Cuba's social protections have not eliminated strong educational gradients in behavioral risk factors, but the healthcare system appears to have eliminated disparities such as in hypertension treatment.",[],PloS one,2021-03-05,"[{'lastname': 'Dieci', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Berkeley School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Llibre-Rodriguez', 'firstname': 'Juan J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Medicina Finlay-Albarran, Medical University of Havana, Havana, Cuba.'}, {'lastname': 'Acosta', 'firstname': 'Daisy', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ureña, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Dow', 'firstname': 'William H', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': 'Berkeley School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.'}]",,"Smoking is comparatively high in Cuba, but obesity is low, and the resulting biomarkers show comparatively mixed patterns.

420,33649759,Risk Factors for Incident Falls and Fractures in Older Men With and Without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases falls and fracture risk. Our objective was to compare incidence and risk factors for falls and fractures in community-dwelling older men with and without T2DM.
A total of 1705 men (471 with T2DM; 1234 without T2DM) aged ≥70 years were assessed at baseline. Men were contacted every 4 months for 6.0 ± 2.2 years to ascertain incident falls and fractures, with the latter being confirmed by radiographic reports. Hip fractures were ascertained via data linkage (follow-up: 8.8 ± 3.6 years). Risk factors for falls and fractures included physical activity and function, body composition, medications, and vision measures.
Men with T2DM had similar fall (incident rate ratio [IRR]: 0.92 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.70, 1.12], n = 1246) and fracture rates (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.56, 1.32], n = 1326) compared to men without T2DM after adjustment for significant risk factors. In men with T2DM, depression (IRR: 1.87 [95% CI: 1.05, 3.34], n = 333), sulphonylurea usage (IRR: 2.07 [95% CI: 1.30, 3.27]) and a greater number of prescription medications (IRR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.24]) were independently associated with increased fall rates, and higher total hip bone mineral density was independently associated with lower fracture rates (HR: 0.63 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.86], n = 351). Interaction terms demonstrated that better contrast sensitivity was independently associated with lower fracture rates (HR: 0.14 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.87]) in men with T2DM compared to men without T2DM.
Fall and fracture rates were similar in men with and without T2DM after adjusting for significant risk factors. Vision assessments including contrast sensitivity measures may improve fracture prediction in older men with T2DM.","['Body composition', 'Bone', 'Falls', 'Fractures', 'Sarcopenia', 'Type 2 diabetes']","The journals of gerontology.

32611641",Sex Differences in Cognitive Decline Among US Adults.,"Sex differences in dementia risk are unclear, but some studies have found greater risk for women.
To determine associations between sex and cognitive decline in order to better understand sex differences in dementia risk.
This cohort study used pooled analysis of individual participant data from 5 cohort studies for years 1971 to 2017: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Framingham Offspring Study, and Northern Manhattan Study. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate changes in each continuous cognitive outcome over time by sex. Data analysis was completed from March 2019 to October 2020.
Sex.
The primary outcome was change in global cognition. Secondary outcomes were change in memory and executive function. Outcomes were standardized as t scores (mean [SD], 50 [10]); a 1-point difference represents a 0.1-SD difference in cognition.
Among 34 349 participants, 26 088 who self-reported Black or White race, were free of stroke and dementia, and had covariate data at or before the first cognitive assessment were included for analysis. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 7.9 (5.3-20.5) years. There were 11 775 (44.7%) men (median [interquartile range] age, 58 [51-66] years at first cognitive assessment; 2229 [18.9%] Black) and 14 313 women (median [interquartile range] age, 58 [51-67] years at first cognitive assessment; 3636 [25.4%] Black). Women had significantly higher baseline performance than men in global cognition (2.20 points higher; 95% CI, 2.04 to 2.35 points; P < .001), executive function (2.13 points higher; 95% CI, 1.98 to 2.29 points; P < .001), and memory (1.89 points higher; 95% CI, 1.72 to 2.06 points; P < .001). Compared with men, women had significantly faster declines in global cognition (-0.07 points/y faster; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.05 points/y; P < .001) and executive function (-0.06 points/y faster; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.05 points/y; P < .001). Men and women had similar declines in memory (-0.004 points/y faster; 95% CI, -0.023 to 0.014; P = .61).
The results of this cohort study suggest that women may have greater cognitive reserve but faster cognitive decline than men, which could contribute to sex differences in late-life dementia.",[],JAMA

26673150",Epigenetic Age Acceleration and Cognitive Decline: A Twin Study.,"Little is known about the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) epigenetic age acceleration in cognitive decline. Using a twin study design, we examined whether DNAm age acceleration is related to cognitive decline measured longitudinally in persons without a clinical diagnosis of dementia.
We studied 266 paired male twins (133 pairs) with a mean age of 56 years at baseline. Of these, 114 paired twins returned for a follow-up after an average of 11.5 years. We obtained 6 indices of DNAm age acceleration based on epigenome-wide data from peripheral blood lymphocytes. At both baseline and follow-up, we administered a battery of cognitive measures and constructed 2 composite scores, one for executive function and one for memory function. We fitted multivariable mixed regression models to examine the association of DNAm age acceleration markers with cognitive function within pairs.
In cross-sectional analyses at baseline, there was no association between DNAm age acceleration and cognitive function scores. In longitudinal analyses, however, comparing twins within pairs, each additional year of age acceleration using the Horvath's method was associated with a 3% decline (95% CI, 1%-5%) in the composite executive function score and a 2.5% decline (95% CI, 0.01%-4.9%) in the memory function score. These results did not attenuate after adjusting for education and other risk factors.
Middle-aged men who had older DNAm age relative to their brothers of the same demographic age showed a faster rate of cognitive decline in the subsequent 11.5 years. These results point to the role of epigenetic modifications in cognitive aging.","['Biomarkers', 'Cognitive aging', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetics', 'Twin studies']","The journals of gerontology.

423,33602472,Subclinical Atherosclerosis and Brain Metabolism in Middle-Aged Individuals: The PESA Study.,"Atherosclerosis has been linked to cognitive decline in late life; however, the impact of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and subclinical atherosclerosis on brain metabolism at earlier stages remains unexplored.
This study sought to determine the association between brain metabolism, subclinical atherosclerosis, and CVRFs in middle-aged asymptomatic individuals.
This study included 547 asymptomatic middle-aged participants (50 ± 4 years, 82% men) from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study with evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis. Participants underwent 
Global FDG uptake showed an inverse correlation with 30-year Framingham Risk Score (FRS) (β = -0.15, p < 0.001). This association was mainly driven by the presence of hypertension (d = 0.36, p < 0.001). Carotid plaque burden was inversely associated with global brain FDG uptake (β = -0.16, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for 30-year FRS. Voxel-wise approaches revealed that the brain areas most strongly affected by hypometabolism in association with 30-year FRS, hypertension, and carotid plaque burden were parietotemporal regions (angular, supramarginal, and inferior/middle temporal gyri) and the cingulate gyrus.
In asymptomatic middle-aged individuals, cardiovascular risk is associated with brain hypometabolism, with hypertension being the modifiable CVRF showing the strongest association. Subclinical carotid plaque burden is also linked to reduced brain metabolism independently of CVRFs. Cerebral areas showing hypometabolism include those known to be affected in dementia. These data reinforce the need to control CVRFs early in life in order to potentially reduce the brain's midlife vulnerability to future cognitive dysfunction.","['(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'cardiovascular risk', 'dementia', 'hypertension', 'statistical parametric mapping']",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2021-02-20,"[{'lastname': 'Cortes-Canteli', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gispert', 'firstname': 'Juan Domingo', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center (BBRC), Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red (CIBER) de Bioingeniería, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina, Madrid, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Salvadó', 'firstname': 'Gemma', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center (BBRC), Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Toribio-Fernandez', 'firstname': 'Raquel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Tristão-Pereira', 'firstname': 'Catarina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Falcon', 'firstname': 'Carles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center (BBRC), Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red (CIBER) de Bioingeniería, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Oliva', 'firstname': 'Belen', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mendiguren', 'firstname': 'Jose', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Banco de Santander, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernandez-Friera', 'firstname': 'Leticia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain; HM Hospitales-Centro Integral de Enfermedades Cardiovasculares, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, Madrid, Spain; CIBER de enfermedades Cardiovasculares, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanz', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia-Ruiz', 'firstname': 'Jose M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain; CIBER de enfermedades Cardiovasculares, Madrid, Spain; Hospital Universitario Central de Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernandez-Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain; CIBER de enfermedades Cardiovasculares, Madrid, Spain; Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria San Carlos, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanchez-Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Philips Healthcare Iberia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibanez', 'firstname': 'Borja', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain; CIBER de enfermedades Cardiovasculares, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Molinuevo', 'firstname': 'José Luis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center (BBRC), Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; CIBER Fragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable, Madrid, Spain.

27312738",The Contribution of Cerebral Vascular Neuropathology to Mild Stage of Alzheimer's Dementia Using the NACC Database.,"The interaction between cerebral vessel disease (CVD) pathology and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the development of dementia is controversial. We examined the association of cerebral vascular neuropathology and cerebrovascular risk factors with the mild stage of Alzheimer's dementia and cognitive function.
This cross-sectional study included men and women aged 60 years or over who had yearly clinical assessments and had agreed to brain autopsy at the time of death, and who contributed to data stored at the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) in the USA. Cognitively normal and impaired subjects with presumptive aetiology of AD, including mild cognitive impairment (ADMCI) and dementia (Alzheimer's dementia), and with complete neuropathological data, were included in our analyses. We used neuropsychological data proximate to death to create summary measures of global cognition and cognitive domains. Systematic neuropathological assessments documenting the severity of cerebral vascular pathology were included. Logistic and linear regression analyses corrected for age at death, sex and Lewy body pathology were used to examine associations of vessel disease with the severity of Alzheimer's disease dementia, and cognitive function, respectively.
No significant relationship was observed between late-life risk factors and Alzheimer's dementia. The severity of arteriosclerosis and presence of global infarcts/lacunes were related to mild Alzheimer's dementia (B=0.423, p<0.001; B=0.366, p=0.026), and the effects were significant after adjusting for neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (B=0.385, p<0.001; B=0.63, p=0.001). When vascular brain injuries were subdivided into old and acute/subacute types, we found that old microinfarcts and old microbleeds were associated with mild Alzheimer's dementia (B=0.754, p=0.007; B=2.331, p=0.032). The old microinfarcts remained significantly associated with mild Alzheimer's dementia after correcting AD pathologies (B=1.31, p<0.001). In addition, the number of microinfarcts in the cerebral cortex had a significant relation with mild Alzheimer's dementia, whether or not the data were corrected for AD pathologies (B=0.616, p=0.016; B=0.884, p=0.005). Atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis and white matter rarefaction were found to be significantly associated with faster progression of Alzheimer's dementia (B=0.068, p=0.001; B=0.046, p=0.016, B=0.081, p=0.037), but white matter rarefaction no longer had a significant effect after adjusting for AD pathologies. We also found that the severity of atherosclerosis was related to impairment in processing speed (β=-0.112, p=0.006) and executive function (β=-0.092, p=0.023). Arteriosclerosis was significantly associated with language (β=-0.103, p=0.011) and global cognition (β=-0.098, p=0.016) deficits.
Our study found the significant relation of global, old, acute/subacute and regional cerebral vascular pathologies, but not white matter rarefaction, to the onset and severity of Alzheimer's dementia. We also showed that late-life risk factors were found to have no relation with Alzheimer's dementia, and the increased risk of dementia with APOE ε4 is not mediated by CVD. The best interpretation of these findings is that CVD has a potential additive effect with AD pathologies in the development and progression of what is clinically diagnosed as Alzheimer's dementia.","[""Alzheimer's dementia"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Cerebrovascular pathology', 'Cognition', 'amyloid plaques', 'neurodegenerative disorder']",Current Alzheimer research,2021-02-16,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Daniel K', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Aged Care and Rehabilitation, Bankstown Hospital, Bankstown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Crawford', 'firstname': 'John D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sachdev', 'firstname': 'Perminder S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Braidy', 'firstname': 'Nady', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}]",,"Our study found the significant relation of global, old, acute/subacute and regional cerebral vascular pathologies, but not white matter rarefaction, to the onset and severity of Alzheimer's dementia.

3337862",Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the health of geriatric patients: The European GeroCovid Observational Study.,"Despite the growing evidence on COVID-19, there are still many gaps in the understanding of this disease, especially in individuals in advanced age. We describe the study protocol of GeroCovid Observational, a multi-purpose, multi-setting and multicenter initiative that aims at investigating: risk factors, clinical presentation and outcomes of individuals affected by COVID-19 in acute and residential care settings; best strategies to prevent infection in long-term care facilities; and, impact of the pandemic on neuropsychologic, functional and physical health, and on medical management in outpatients and home care patients at risk of COVID-19, with a special focus on individuals with dementia.
GeroCovid involves individuals aged ≥60 years, at risk of or affected by COVID-19, prospectively or retrospectively observed since March 1
At September 16
GeroCovid will explore relevant aspects of COVID-19 in adults aged ≥60 years with high-quality and comprehensive data, which will help to optimize COVID-19 prevention and management, with practical implications for ongoing and possible future pandemics.

24161054",Delirium as a predictor of mortality and disability among hospitalized patients in Zambia.,"To study the epidemiology and outcomes of delirium among hospitalized patients in Zambia.
We conducted a prospective cohort study at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, from October 2017 to April 2018. The primary exposure was delirium duration over the initial 3 days of hospitalization, assessed daily using the Brief Confusion Assessment Method. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality. Secondary outcomes included 6-month disability, evaluated using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0.
711 adults were included (median age, 39 years; 461 men; 459 medical, 252 surgical; 323 with HIV). Delirium prevalence was 48.5% (95% CI, 44.8%-52.3%). 6-month mortality was higher for delirious participants (44.6% [39.3%-50.1%]) versus non-delirious participants (20.0% [15.4%-25.2%]; P < .001). After adjusting for covariates, delirium duration independently predicted 6-month mortality and disability with a significant dose-response association between number of days with delirium and odds of worse clinical outcome. Compared to no delirium, presence of 1, 2 or 3 days of delirium resulted in odds ratios for 6-month mortality of 1.43 (95% CI, 0.73-2.80), 2.20 (1.07-4.51), and 3.92 (2.24-6.87), respectively (P < .001). Odds of 6-month disability were 1.20 (0.70-2.05), 1.73 (0.95-3.17), and 2.80 (1.78-4.43), respectively (P < .001).
Among hospitalized medical and surgical patients in Zambia, delirium prevalence was high and delirium duration independently predicted mortality and disability at 6 months. This work lays the foundation for prevention, detection, and management of delirium in low-income countries.

29405232",Mental Component Score (MCS) from Health-Related Quality of Life Predicts Incidence of Dementia in U.S. Males.,"The Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36) measures health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from the individual's point of view and is an indicator of overall health status.
To examine whether HRQoL shows differential changes over time prior to dementia onset and investigate whether HRQoL predicts incidence of dementia.
Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by Vitamin E and Selenium (PREADViSE) trial, which recruited 7,547 non-demented men between 2002 and 2009. A subset of 2,746 PREADViSE participants who completed up to five SF-36 assessments at annual visits was included in the current analysis.
Secondary data analysis of PREADViSE data.
A subset of 2,746 PREADViSE participants who completed up to five SF-36 assessments at annual visits was included in the current analysis.
Two summary T scores were generated for analysis: physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS), each with a mean of 50 (standard deviation of 10); higher scores are better. Linear mixed models (LMM) were applied to determine if mean component scores varied over time or by eventual dementia status. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine if the baseline component scores were associated with dementia incidence, adjusting for baseline age, race, APOE-4 carrier status, sleep apnea, and self-reported memory complaint at baseline.
The mean baseline MCS score for participants who later developed dementia (mean± SD: 53.9±9.5) was significantly lower than for those participants who did not develop dementia during the study (mean±SD: 56.4±6.5; p = 0.005). Mean PCS scores at baseline (dementia: 49.3±7.9 vs. non-dementia: 49.8±7.8) were not significantly different (p = 0.5) but LMM analysis showed a significant time effect. For MCS, the indicator for eventual dementia diagnosis was significantly associated with poorer scores after adjusting for baseline age, race, and memory complaint. Adjusted for other baseline risk factors, the Cox model showed that a 10-unit increase in MCS was associated with a 44% decrease in the hazard of a future dementia diagnosis (95% CI: 32%-55%).
The SF-36 MCS summary score may serve as a predictor for future dementia and could be prognostic in longitudinal dementia research.","['Health-related Quality of Life', 'dementia', 'outcome measures']",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2021-02-12,"[{'lastname': 'Ding', 'firstname': 'X', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Xiuhua Ding, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Public Health, Western Kentucky University, 1906 College Heights Blvd, Bowling Green, KY 42101, USA, Email: xiuhua.ding@wku.edu, phone: 270-745-3618, Fax: 270-745-6950.'}, {'lastname': 'Abner', 'firstname': 'E L', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schmitt', 'firstname': 'F A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Crowley', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Goodman', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kryscio', 'firstname': 'R J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,The SF-36 MCS summary score may serve as a predictor for future dementia and could be prognostic in longitudinal dementia research.,"The mean baseline MCS score for participants who later developed dementia (mean± SD: 53.9±9.5) was significantly lower than for those participants who did not develop dementia during the study (mean±SD: 56.4±6.5; p = 0.005).

15482868",Social-environmental resiliencies protect against loneliness among HIV-Positive and HIV- negative older men who have sex with men: Results from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS).,"Loneliness is associated with negative health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, dementia, physical functional decline, depression, and increased mortality risk, among HIV- positive and HIV-negative older men who have sex with men (MSM). Given these negative health outcomes, it is imperative to identify factors that minimize loneliness in these vulnerable groups.
We sought to examine whether social-environmental resiliencies-defined as an individual's level of support, social bonding, and psychological sense of community among gay men-buffer against symptoms of loneliness.
We analyzed longitudinal data from 1,255 older MSM with and without HIV infection, all of whom were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Using longitudinal latent class analysis (LLCA), we identified three underlying classes (Social Connectors, Non-community Connectors, and Social Isolates) in the social environment of the sample. We assessed the prevalence of loneliness by these latent classes. By lagging social environmental factors over time, we were able to examine the temporal relationships between latent classes and subsequent loneliness.
Consistent with our hypothesis, multivariate associations revealed that compared to Social Connectors with high levels of social support and social bonding and a strong perceived sense of community among gay men, Social Isolates (Prevalence Ratio (PR): 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08-1.88; p = 0.0120) and Non-community Connectors (PR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03-1.75; p = 0.0322) were more likely to experience loneliness after adjustment for covariates and baseline loneliness. There were no differences by HIV status.
These longitudinal data allowed us to make causal inferences related to the social environmental resiliencies lowering the odds of loneliness among HIV-positive and HIV-negative older MSM. Developing individual- and community-level tailored interventions for these populations by leveraging social environmental resiliencies is key to reducing loneliness and promoting health.","['HIV/AIDS', 'Loneliness', 'Older men who have sex with men', 'Resilience', 'Social bonding', 'Social cohesion', 'Social environment', 'Social support']",Social science & medicine (1982),2021-02-08,"[{'lastname': 'De Jesus', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of International Service, Center on Health, Risk, and Society, American University, Washington, DC, USA.

429,33549747,Vascular risk factors are associated with a decline in resting-state functional connectivity in cognitively unimpaired individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease: Vascular risk factors and functional connectivity changes.,"Resting-state functional connectivity is suggested to be cross-sectionally associated with both vascular burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, evidence is lacking regarding longitudinal changes in functional connectivity. This study includes 247 cognitively unimpaired individuals with a family history of sporadic AD (185 women/ 62 men; mean [SD] age of 63 [5.3] years). Plasma total-, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at baseline. Global (whole-brain) brain functional connectivity and connectivity from canonical functional networks were computed from resting-state functional MRI obtained at baseline and ~3.5 years of annual follow-ups, using a predefined functional parcellation. A subsample underwent Aβ- and tau-PET (n=91). Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that global functional connectivity increased over time across the entire sample. In contrast, higher total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were associated with greater reduction of functional connectivity in the default-mode network over time. In addition, higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with global functional connectivity reduction. The associations were similar when the analyses were repeated using two other functional brain parcellations. Aβ and tau deposition in the brain were not associated with changes in functional connectivity over time in the subsample. These findings provide evidence that vascular burden is associated with a decrease in functional connectivity over time in older adults with elevated risk for AD. Future studies are needed to determine if the impact of vascular risk factors on functional brain changes precede the impact of AD pathology on functional brain changes.","['Default-mode network', 'Global functional connectivity', 'Longitudinal resting-state functional connectivity', 'Vascular risk factors', 'tau', 'β-Amyloid']",NeuroImage,2021-02-08,"[{'lastname': 'Köbe', 'firstname': 'Theresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, H3A 1A1, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Studies on Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (StoP-AD) Centre, H4H 1R3, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), 01307, Dresden, Germany.

30630957",Body mass index trajectories and the risk for Alzheimer's disease among older adults.,"The effect of body mass index (BMI) changes and variability on the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We analyzed 45,076 participants, whose BMI were measured on phase 1 (2002-2003), phase 2 (2004-2005), and phase 3 (2006-2007), of the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort. We evaluated the effect of 2- and 4-year BMI changes and BMI variability on the risk of AD using Cox regression models. In men, association between 2-year BMI changes, BMI variability, and the risk of AD was not significant. Risk of AD was higher in men whose BMI had decreased 10.1-15.0% over 4 years. In women, aHRs and 95% CIs for AD were 1.14 (1.02-1.29), 1.44 (1.17-1.79), and 1.51 (1.09-2.09) when 2-year BMI loss was 5.1-10.0%, 10.1-15.0%, and > 15.0%. The HRs for AD in women significantly increased when 4-year BMI loss was > 5.0%. The aHR and 95% CI for AD was 1.31 (1.17-1.46) in the 4th quartile of average successive variability (ASV) compared with the 1st quartile of ASV in women. BMI loss over 2- and 4-year period was associated with increased risk for AD, and risk increased in women with higher BMI variability.

25587908",Longitudinal 5-year prediction of cognitive impairment among men with HIV disease.,"Although combination antiretroviral therapy reduced the prevalence of HIV-associated dementia, milder syndromes persist. Our goals were to predict cognitive impairment of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) participants 5 years ahead and from a large pool of factors, select the ones that mostly contributed to our predictions.
Longitudinal, natural and treated history of HIV infection among MSM.
The MACS is a longitudinal study of the natural and treated history of HIV disease in MSM; the neuropsychological substudy aims to characterize cognitive disorders in men with HIV disease.
We modeled on an annual basis the risk of cognitive impairment 5 years in the future. We were able to predict cognitive impairment at individual level with high precision and overperform default methods. We found that while a diagnosis of AIDS is a critical risk factor, HIV infection per se does not necessarily convey additional risk. Other infectious processes, most notably hepatitis B and C, are independently associated with increased risk of impairment. The relative importance of an AIDS diagnosis diminished across calendar time.
Our prediction models are a powerful tool to help clinicians address dementia in early stages for MACS paticipants. The strongest predictors of future cognitive impairment included the presence of clinical AIDS and hepatitis B or C infection.

25288138",High-intensity exercise and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults: a pilot randomised clinical trial.,"Physical inactivity has been consistently linked to increased risk of cognitive decline; however, studies examining the impact of exercise interventions on cognition have produced inconsistent findings. Some observational studies suggest exercise intensity may be important for inducing cognitive improvements; however, this has yet to be thoroughly examined in older adult cohorts. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of systematically manipulated high-intensity and moderate-intensity exercise interventions on cognition.
This multi-arm pilot randomised clinical trial investigated the effects of 6 months of high-intensity exercise and moderate-intensity exercise, compared with an inactive control, on cognition. Outcome measures were assessed at pre- (baseline), post- (6 months), and 12 months post-intervention. Ninety-nine cognitively normal men and women (aged 60-80 years) were enrolled from October 2016 to November 2017. Participants that were allocated to an exercise group (i.e. high-intensity or moderate-intensity) engaged in cycle-based exercise two times per week for 6 months. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by a graded exercise test.
There was a dose-dependent effect of exercise intensity on cardiorespiratory fitness, whereby the high-intensity group experienced greater increases in fitness than the moderate-intensity and control groups. However, there was no direct effect of exercise on cognition.
We did not observe a direct effect of exercise on cognition. Future work in this field should be appropriately designed and powered to examine factors that may contribute to individual variability in response to intervention.

11250628",Longitudinal Association Between Oral Status and Cognitive Decline Using Fixed-effects Analysis.,"Although the feasibility of randomized trials for investigating the long-term association between oral health and cognitive decline is low, deriving causal inferences from observational data is challenging. We aimed to investigate the association between poor oral status and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) using fixed-effects model to eliminate the confounding effect of unobserved time-invariant factors.
We used data from Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) which was conducted in 2010, 2013, and 2016. β regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated using fixed-effects models to determine the effect of deteriorating oral status on developing SCC. Onset of SCC was evaluated using the Kihon Checklist-Cognitive function score. Four oral status variables were used: awareness of swallowing difficulty, decline in masticatory function, dry mouth, and number of teeth.
We included 13,594 participants (55.8% women) without SCC at baseline. The mean age was 72.4 (standard deviation [SD], 5.1) years for men and 72.4 (SD, 4.9) years for women. Within the 6-year follow-up, 26.6% of men and 24.9% of women developed SCC. The probability of developing SCC was significantly higher when participants acquired swallowing difficulty (β = 0.088; 95% CI, 0.065-0.111 for men and β = 0.077; 95% CI, 0.057-0.097 for women), decline in masticatory function (β = 0.039; 95% CI, 0.021-0.057 for men and β = 0.030; 95% CI, 0.013-0.046 for women), dry mouth (β = 0.026; 95% CI, 0.005-0.048 for men and β = 0.064; 95% CI, 0.045-0.083 for women), and tooth loss (β = 0.043; 95% CI, 0.001-0.085 for men and β = 0.058; 95% CI, 0.015-0.102 for women).
The findings suggest that good oral health needs to be maintained to prevent the development of SCC, which increases the risk for future dementia.","['cognitive decline', 'dementia', 'number of teeth', 'oral function', 'oral health']",Journal of epidemiology,2021-02-02,"[{'lastname': 'Kiuchi', 'firstname': 'Sakura', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry.'}, {'lastname': 'Kusama', 'firstname': 'Taro', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry.'}, {'lastname': 'Sugiyama', 'firstname': 'Kemmyo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'Takafumi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry.'}, {'lastname': 'Cooray', 'firstname': 'Upul', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'Tatsuo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dental Sociology, Kanagawa Dental University.'}, {'lastname': 'Kondo', 'firstname': 'Katsunori', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Preventive Medical Sciences, Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University.\nDepartment of Gerontological Evaluation, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology.'}, {'lastname': 'Osaka', 'firstname': 'Ken', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University, Graduate School of Dentistry.'}, {'lastname': 'Aida', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral Health Promotion, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University.'}]",,"The findings suggest that good oral health needs to be maintained to prevent the development of SCC, which increases the risk for future dementia.","We included 13,594 participants (55.8% women) without SCC at baseline.

24379444","Dementia identified as a risk factor for infection-related hospital contacts in a national, population-based and longitudinal matched-cohort study.","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between incident dementia and rates of infection-related hospital contacts. We conducted a registry- and population-based matched-cohort study of all Danish residents who were born in or before 1950, included from 1 January 2000 or their 65th birthday (whichever came later), who were alive and resided in Denmark at the start of the study, excluding those who had received a dementia diagnosis before 1 January 2000 or their 65th birthday (n = 1,712,100). A total of 129,660 people (403,744 person years) with incident dementia were matched with 297,476 people (1,918,784 person years) without dementia. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of infection-related hospital contacts were calculated using Poisson regression, by infection type, sex and age. The IRR for any infection-related contact in dementia was 1.5, was highest for nervous and urinary system infections and sepsis, decreased with increasing age and was higher in men. More people with than without dementia had contacts five years before the index date. Our findings show that dementia is a risk factor for infection-related hospital contacts and infections might be an early sign of dementia.",[],Nature aging,2021-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Janbek', 'firstname': 'Janet', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Danish Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

29189302",Sex differences and the role of education in cognitive ageing: analysis of two UK-based prospective cohort studies.,"Previous studies have shown an excess risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among women. Education is thought to have a causal association with dementia onset. We aimed to investigate the role of education in influencing sex differences in cognitive ageing.
We analysed data from two prospective cohort studies in the UK; the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Whitehall II study, to assess sex differences in cognitive performance and cognitive decline by birth cohort (birth year 1930-38, 1939-45, or 1946-55), before and after adjustment for education, and by high and low education level. Memory was assessed using immediate recall, for which data were available from all waves of the ELSA (2002-14) and Whitehall II (1997-2015) studies. Fluency was assessed using a semantic fluency test based on an animal naming task, with data available from all waves of the Whitehall II study and waves one to five (2002-10) and wave seven (2014) of the ELSA study. Cognitive scores were standardised separately in each study based on the mean and SD of the corresponding test among participants aged 50-59 years with secondary education.
15 924 participants were included from the two studies. In pooled analyses, women had better memory scores than men in all birth cohorts, irrespective of adjustment for education (eg, at age 60 years, birth cohort 1930-38, mean difference between sexes [male scores minus female scores] -0·25 SDs [95% CI -0·32 to -0·19] after adjustment for education), and in both education level groups. Memory decline was faster in men than in women (at age 60 years, birth cohort 1946-55, mean difference in 13-year change -0·15 SDs [-0·20 to -0·09]; after adjustment for education -0·14 SDs [-0·20 to -0·08]). Men had better fluency scores than women in earlier birth cohorts and in the low education group (at age 60 years, birth cohort 1930-38, mean difference 0·20 SDs [95% CI 0·05 to 0·36]); but women had better fluency scores than men in later birth cohorts and in the high education group (at age 60 years, birth cohort 1946-55, mean difference -0·17 SDs [-0·24 to -0·10]). No sex differences were observed for fluency decline.
Our findings suggest that decreasing disparities between sexes in education, due to secular increases in educational opportunities, could attenuate sex differences in dementia risk and cognitive decline in the future.

21658213",Huntington's disease among immigrant groups and Swedish-born individuals: a cohort study of all adults 18 years of age and older in Sweden.,"There is a lack of studies of Huntington's disease (HD) in immigrants.
To study the association between country of birth and incident HD in first-generation immigrants versus Swedish-born individuals and in second-generation immigrants versus Swedish-born individuals with Swedish-born parents.
Study populations included all adults aged 18 years and older in Sweden, i.e., in the first-generation study 6,042,891 individuals with 1034 HD cases and in the second-generation study 4,860,469 individuals with 1001 cases. HD was defined as having at least one registered diagnosis of HD in the National Patient Register. The incidence of HD in different first-generation immigrant groups versus Swedish-born individuals was assessed by Cox regression, expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The models were stratified by sex and adjusted for age, geographical residence in Sweden, educational level, marital status, and neighborhood socioeconomic status.
Mean age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were for all Swedish-born 0.82 and for all foreign born 0.53 and for all men 0.73 and for all women 0.81, with the highest incidence rates for the group 80-84 years of age. After adjusting for potential confounders, the HRs were lower in women in the first- and second-generation, i.e., 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.67) and 0.63 (95% 0.45-0.87), respectively, and also among women from Finland or with parents from Finland.
In general, the risk of HD was lower in first-generation and second-generation immigrant women but not among male immigrants.","['Gender', 'Huntington’s disease', 'Immigrants', 'Neighborhood', 'Socioeconomic status']",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2021-01-31,"[{'lastname': 'Wändell', 'firstname': 'Per', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden. per.wandell@ki.se.'}, {'lastname': 'Fredrikson', 'firstname': 'Sten', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlsson', 'firstname': 'Axel C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.\nAcademic Primary Health Care Centre, Stockholm Region, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xinjun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Sundquist', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.\nDepartment of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.\nCenter for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sundquist', 'firstname': 'Kristina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.\nDepartment of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.\nCenter for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan.'}]",,,"Mean age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were for all Swedish-born 0.82 and for all foreign born 0.53 and for all men 0.73 and for all women 0.81, with the highest incidence rates for the group 80-84 years of age.

28855400","Sex, diabetes status and cognition: findings from the study of longevity in diabetes.","Women comprise two-thirds of people with dementia, making female sex a significant dementia risk factor. Both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are known dementia risk factors with an increasing global incidence. Understanding whether subtle sex differences persist in cognitive function prior to dementia in the context of diabetes may help elucidate the magnitude of sex effects on dementia risk.
We examined cross-sectional data from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID), a prospective cohort study of members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California aged 60 years and older with T1D (n=758), T2D (n=232) and without either T1D or T2D (n=247). We used factor analysis to generate summary scores of cognitive domains and used regression analyses to examine the associations between sex and cognition adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular confounders.
We included 1237 participants (630 women and 607 men) with mean age 68 years. By design, the distribution of men and women in T1D, T2D and no diabetes was similar. Women had better cognitive performance than men in global cognition (β=0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.26), language (β=0.08, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.15), executive function (β=0.13, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.20), episodic verbal memory (β=0.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.77) and attention (β=0.20, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.28) but not in episodic visual memory (β=0.006, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.09) adjusting for age and education independent of diabetes status. We did not find an interaction between sex and diabetes status for any of the cognitive outcomes.
Women in late mid-life have better cognitive performance than men in many cognitive domains independent of the presence of T1D or T2D. Further work is required to understand whether these differences change over time or in older cohorts and to understand their relationship to subsequent dementia.","['cognition', 'diabetes complications', 'sex characteristics']",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2021-01-30,"[{'lastname': 'Moran', 'firstname': 'Chris', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Monash University Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia chris.moran@monash.edu.\nPeninsula Health, Frankston, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilsanz', 'firstname': 'Paola', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Beeri', 'firstname': 'Michal S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, New York, USA.\nJoseph Sagol Neuroscience, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Whitmer', 'firstname': 'Rachel A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lacy', 'firstname': 'Mary E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}]",,,"We included 1237 participants (630 women and 607 men) with mean age 68 years.

439,33492296,Gut Microbiota Alterations and Cognitive Impairment Are Sexually Dissociated in a Transgenic Mice Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Normal aging is accompanied by cognitive deficiencies, affecting women and men equally. Aging is the main risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with women having a higher risk. The higher prevalence of AD in women is associated with the abrupt hormonal decline seen after menopause. However, other factors may be involved in this sex-related cognitive decline. Alterations in gut microbiota (GM) and its bioproducts have been reported in AD subjects and transgenic (Tg) mice, having a direct impact on brain amyloid-β pathology in male (M), but not in female (F) mice.
The aim of this work was to determine GM composition and cognitive dysfunction in M and F wildtype (WT) and Tg mice, in a sex/genotype segregation design.
Anxiety, short term working-memory, spatial learning, and long-term spatial memory were evaluated in 6-month-old WT and Tg male mice. Fecal short chain fatty acids were determined by chromatography, and DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were used to determine GM differences.
We observed sex-dependent differences in cognitive skills in WT mice, favoring F mice. However, the cognitive advantage of females was lost in Tg mice. GM composition showed few sex-related differences in WT mice. Contrary, Tg-M mice presented a more severe dysbiosis than Tg-F mice. A decreased abundance of Ruminococcaceae was associated with cognitive deficits in Tg-F mice, while butyrate levels were positively associated with better working- and object recognition-memory in WT-F mice.

440,33491036,Performance of the Short Physical Performance Battery in Identifying the Frailty Phenotype and Predicting Geriatric Syndromes in Community-Dwelling Elderly.,"The early identification of seniors at high risk of geriatric syndromes is fundamental for targeting interventions to those who most need them. To date, the predictive value of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) for multifactorial clinical conditions has not been clearly established. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the SPPB could identify frailty and predict geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling older adults. Participants comprised men and women aged 60 years and older who participated in the Health and Well-being and Aging Survey in Colombia 2015 (n=4125, 57.6% women). A structured interview was administered to obtain socio-demographic data which included age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and urbanicity. The study included the measurement of body mass, grip strength, SPPB, Lawton´s instrumental ADL scale, specific subjective memory complaints (SSMC), frailty phenotype (Fried and FRAIL Scale), and self-reported falls, geriatric syndromes and/or medical conditions. ROC analysis was used to examine the ability of the SPPB test to predict frailty and geriatric syndromes. The cutoff that maximized both sensitivity and specificity for the frailty phenotype was 8 points or below for men and 7 points or below for women. These cutoff values significantly predicted four geriatric syndromes in descending order: mild dementia (♂ ORajus 3.34, and ♀ ORajus 2.79), low grip strength (♂ ORajus 1.98, and ♀ ORajus 2.45), falls (♂ ORajus 1.39, and ♀ ORajus 1.49), and SSMC (♂ ORajus 1.39). In summary, the main finding of the present study was that SPPB score (i.e., ≤ 8 ♂ and ≤ 7 ♀) seems to be a useful measure for identifying the physical frailty phenotype and predicting geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling older adults.","['Latinos', 'Physical performance', 'elderly', 'frailty', 'geriatric syndromes']","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2021-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Ramírez-Vélez', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Robinson Ramirez-Velez, Pública de Navarra (UPNA)-Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (CHN), Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), 31008, Calle Cataluña, s/n, 31006 Pamplona, Navarra, Spain, E-mail: robin640@hotmail.com, Phone: +34-695-526-321.'}, {'lastname': 'López Sáez de Asteasu', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Morley', 'firstname': 'J E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cano-Gutierrez', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Izquierdo', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,,10.1007/s12603-020-1484-3,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd89dc70>,,,,,,
441,33491029,Effects of Multicomponent Exercise on Cognitive Performance and Fall Risk in Older Women with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Emerging evidence suggests that multicomponent exercise provides greater benefits for physical and cognitive function than single component exercise. However, few studies have been conducted to determine these effects in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and findings have been less conclusive. It has been reported that older women have a greater risk of falls and a higher incidence of dementia than men.
To examine the effects of multicomponent exercise on cognitive performance and fall risk in older women with MCI.
An experimental design comparing the exercise and control groups.
Forty community-dwelling older women with MCI were allocated to the exercise (n = 20) and control (n = 20) groups.
Twelve weeks of multicomponent exercise program (aerobic, resistance, and balance exercise) 60 mins/day, 3 days/week.
Cognitive performance including the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Trail Making Test (TMT) and fall risk including the Timed Up and Go (TUG) single-, dual-task, and Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) were administered before and after the 12-week exercise program.
At the end of the 12-week training, participants in the exercise group had a significantly greater improvement in TMT part A (p < 0.05), TUG dual-task (p < 0.05), and PPA composite score (p < 0.05) when compared to the control group. The exercise group also demonstrated significant improvement in TUG dual-task, PPA composite score, PPA subcomponents including postural sway and reaction time when compared to baseline (p < 0.05). In contrast, at 12-week, the control group showed a decline in TUG dual-task performance as compared to baseline (p < 0.05).
The 12-week multicomponent exercise improved attention, dual-task ability, and reduced risk of falling in older women with mild cognitive impairment.","['Mild cognitive impairment', 'cognitive function', 'fall risk', 'multicomponent exercise']","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2021-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Thaiyanto', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Somporn Sungkarat, Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand, 50200; E-mail address: somporn.sungkarat@cmu.ac.th; Tel. + 66 53 949 249; Fax. +66 53 946 042.'}, {'lastname': 'Sittichoke', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Phirom', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sungkarat', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,"The 12-week multicomponent exercise improved attention, dual-task ability, and reduced risk of falling in older women with mild cognitive impairment.","At the end of the 12-week training, participants in the exercise group had a significantly greater improvement in TMT part A (p < 0.05), TUG dual-task (p < 0.05), and PPA composite score (p < 0.05) when compared to the control group.

25747849",Body mass index and mild cognitive impairment among rural older adults in China: the moderating roles of gender and age.,"Evidence concerning the association between body mass index (BMI) and cognitive function among older people is inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate gender and age as moderators in association between BMI and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among rural older adults.
Data were derived from the 2019 Health Service for Rural Elderly Families Survey in Shandong, China. In total, 3242 people aged 60 years and above were included in the analysis. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the moderating roles of gender and age, then further to explore the relationship between BMI and MCI.
There were 601 (18.5%) participants with MCI. Compared with normal BMI group, low BMI group had a higher risk of MCI among older people [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26-3.44], women (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.35-3.12), or the older elderly aged ≥75 years old (aOR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.34-7.45). This effect remained statistically significant among older women (aOR = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.69-6.73). Among older men, elevated BMI group had a higher risk of MCI (aOR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.17-4.61) than normal BMI group.
Gender and age moderated the association between BMI and MCI among Chinese rural older adults. Older women with low BMI were more likely to have MCI, but older men with elevated BMI were more likely to have MCI. These findings suggest rural community managers strengthen the health management by grouping the weight of older people to prevent the risk of dementia.","['Age difference', 'Body mass index', 'Gender difference', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Older adults']",BMC psychiatry,2021-01-25,"[{'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Yemin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Jie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Nan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing, Social Statistics, School of Social Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Peipei', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jing', 'firstname': 'Zhengyue', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Caiting', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hao', 'firstname': 'Wenting', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Chengchao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China. zhouchengchao@sdu.edu.cn.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. zhouchengchao@sdu.edu.cn.'}]",,,"There were 601 (18.5%) participants with MCI.

24365081",Temporal Trends in Incidence Rates of Lower Extremity Amputation and Associated Risk Factors Among Patients Using Veterans Health Administration Services From 2008 to 2018.,"Lower extremity amputation (LEA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, national temporal trends of LEA incidence rates among US veterans and associated factors have not been well characterized.
To describe the temporal trends of LEA, characterize associated risk factors, and decompose the associations of these risk factors with changes in temporal trends of LEA among US veterans using Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) services between 2008 and 2018.
This cohort study used VA data from 2008 to 2018 to estimate incidence rates of LEA among veterans using VA services. Cox regression models were used to identify risk factors associated with LEA. Decomposition analyses estimated the associations of changes in prevalence of risk factors with changes in LEA rates. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2018.
Toe, transmetatarsal, below-knee, or above-knee LEA.
A total of 6 493 141 veterans were included (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [54-76] years; 6 060 390 [93.4%] men). Veterans were studied for a median (interquartile range) of 10.9 (5.6-11.0) years. Between 2008 and 2018, rates of LEA increased from 12.89 (95% CI, 12.53-13.25) LEA per 10 000 persons to 18.12 (95% CI, 17.70-18.54) LEA per 10 000 persons, representing a net increase of 5.23 (95% CI, 4.68-5.78) LEA per 10 000 persons. Between 2008 and 2018, toe amputation rates increased by 3.24 (2.89-3.59) amputations per 10 000 persons, accounting for 62.0% of the total increase in LEA rates. Transmetatarsal amputations increased by 1.54 (95% CI, 1.27-1.81) amputations per 10 000 persons; below-knee amputation rates increased by 0.81 (95% CI, 0.56-1.05) amputations per 10 000 persons; and above-knee amputation rates decreased by 0.37 (95% CI, 0.14-0.59) amputations per 10 000 persons. Compared with men, women had decreased risk of any LEA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34 [95% CI, 0.31-0.37]). Factors associated with increased risk of any LEA included Black race (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21-1.28]) or another non-White race (ie, Asian, Latino, or other; HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 2.30-2.42]), obesity (HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.55-1.63]), diabetes (HR, 6.38 [95% CI, 6.22-6.54]), chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, CKD stage 5: HR, 3.94 [95% CI, 3.22-4.83]), and smoking status (eg, current smoking: HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.92-2.03]). Decomposition analyses suggested that while changes in demographic composition, primarily driven by increased proportion of women veterans, associated with a decrease of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14-0.22) LEA per 10 000 persons, and decreases in smoking rates, associated with a decrease of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79-0.97) LEA per 10 000 persons. However, these were overwhelmed by increased rates of diabetes, associated with an increase of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.72-1.99) LEA per 10 000 persons; peripheral arterial disease, associated with an increase of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41-1.65) LEA per 10 000 persons; CKD, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons; and other clinical factors, including body mass index, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, dementia, and hypertension, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons.
This cohort study found that incidence rates of LEA among veterans using VA services increased between 2008 and 2018.

Between 2008 and 2018, toe amputation rates increased by 3.24 (2.89-3.59) amputations per 10 000 persons, accounting for 62.0% of the total increase in LEA rates. Transmetatarsal amputations increased by 1.54 (95% CI, 1.27-1.81) amputations per 10 000 persons; below-knee amputation rates increased by 0.81 (95% CI, 0.56-1.05) amputations per 10 000 persons; and above-knee amputation rates decreased by 0.37 (95% CI, 0.14-0.59) amputations per 10 000 persons. Compared with men, women had decreased risk of any LEA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34 [95% CI, 0.31-0.37]). Factors associated with increased risk of any LEA included Black race (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21-1.28]) or another non-White race (ie, Asian, Latino, or other; HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 2.30-2.42]), obesity (HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.55-1.63]), diabetes (HR, 6.38 [95% CI, 6.22-6.54]), chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, CKD stage 5: HR, 3.94 [95% CI, 3.22-4.83]), and smoking status (eg, current smoking: HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.92-2.03]). Decomposition analyses suggested that while changes in demographic composition, primarily driven by increased proportion of women veterans, associated with a decrease of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14-0.22) LEA per 10 000 persons, and decreases in smoking rates, associated with a decrease of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79-0.97) LEA per 10 000 persons. However, these were overwhelmed by increased rates of diabetes, associated with an increase of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.72-1.99) LEA per 10 000 persons; peripheral arterial disease, associated with an increase of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41-1.65) LEA per 10 000 persons; CKD, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons; and other clinical factors, including body mass index, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, dementia, and hypertension, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons.",,"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33953

21349153",Age and Sex Differences in the Associations of Pulse Pressure With White Matter and Subcortical Microstructure.,"Midlife vascular disease increases risk for dementia and effects of vascular dysfunction on brain health differ between men and women. Elevated pulse pressure, a surrogate for arterial stiffness, contributes to cerebrovascular pathology and white matter damage that may advance cognitive aging; however, it remains unclear how associations between pulse pressure and neural integrity differ by sex and age. This study used restriction spectrum imaging to examine associations between pulse pressure and brain microstructure in community-dwelling women (N=88) and men (N=55), aged 56 to 97 (mean, 76.3) years. Restricted isotropic (presumed intracellular), hindered isotropic (presumed extracellular), neurite density, and free water diffusion were computed in white matter tracts and subcortical regions. After adjustment for age and sex, higher pulse pressure correlated with lower restricted isotropic diffusion in global white matter, with more pronounced associations in parahippocampal cingulum, as well as in thalamus and hippocampus. Subgroup analyses demonstrated stronger correlations between pulse pressure and restricted isotropic diffusion in association fibers for participants ≤75 years than for older participants, with stronger effects for women than men of this age group. Microstructure in parahippocampal cingulum and thalamus differed by pulse pressure level regardless of antihypertensive treatment. Increased pulse pressure may lead to widespread injury to white matter and subcortical structures, with greatest vulnerability for women in late middle to early older age. Restriction spectrum imaging could be useful for monitoring microstructural changes indicative of neuronal loss or shrinkage, demyelination, or inflammation that accompany age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction.","['aging', 'blood pressure', 'brain', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'white matter']","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2021-01-20,"[{'lastname': 'Reas', 'firstname': 'Emilie T', 'initials': 'ET', 'affiliation': 'From the Department of Neurosciences (E.T.R., A.M.D.), University of California, San Diego.'}, {'lastname': 'Laughlin', 'firstname': 'Gail A', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine and Public Health (G.A.L., L.K.M.), University of California, San Diego.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagler', 'firstname': 'Donald J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology (D.J.H., R.R.L., A.M.D., L.K.M.), University of California, San Diego.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Roland R', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology (D.J.H., R.R.L., A.M.D., L.K.M.), University of California, San Diego.\nRadiology Services, VA San Diego Healthcare System (R.R.L.).'}, {'lastname': 'Dale', 'firstname': 'Anders M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'From the Department of Neurosciences (E.T.R., A.M.D.), University of California, San Diego.\nDepartment of Radiology (D.J.H., R.R.L., A.M.D., L.K.M.), University of California, San Diego.'}, {'lastname': 'McEvoy', 'firstname': 'Linda K', 'initials': 'LK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine and Public Health (G.A.L., L.K.M.), University of California, San Diego.\nDepartment of Radiology (D.J.H., R.R.L., A.M.D., L.K.M.), University of California, San Diego.'}]",,,,,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.16446,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd6cb590>,,,,,,

27286818",The Interdependence of Blood Pressure and Glucose in Vietnam.,"Modelling of associations of systolic blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose (BG) with their explanatory factors in separate regressions treats them as having independent biological mechanisms. This can lead to statistical inferences that are unreliable because the substantial overlap in their etiologic and disease mechanisms is ignored.
This study aimed to examine the relationship of systolic blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose (BG) with measures of obesity and central fat distribution and other factors whilst taking account of the inter-dependence between them.
Participants (n = 14706, 53.5 % females) aged 25-64 years were selected by multi-stage stratified cluster sampling from eight provinces each representing one of the eight geographical regions of Vietnam. Measurements were made using the World Health Organization STEPS protocols.
Structural modelling identified direct effects for BG (men P = 0.000, women P = 0.029), age (men P = 0.000, women P = 0.000) and body mass index (BMI) (men P = 0.000, women P = 0.000) in the estimation of systolic BP, and for systolic BP (men P = 0.036, women P = 0.000) and waist circumference (WC) (men P = 0.032, women P = 0.009) in the estimation of BG. There were indirect effects of age, cholesterol, physical activity and tobacco smoking via their influence on WC and BMI. The errors in estimation of systolic BP and BG were correlated (men P = 0.000, women P = 0.004), the stability indices (men 0.466, women 0.495) showed the non-recursive models were stable, and the proportion of variance explained was mid-range (men 0.553, women 0.579).
This study provided statistical evidence of a feedback loop between systolic BP and BG. BMI and WC were confirmed to be their primary explanatory factors. Saturated fat intake and physical activity were identified as possible targets of intervention for overweight and obesity, and indirectly for reducing systolic BP and BG. Harmful/hazardous alcohol intake was identified as a target of intervention for systolic BP.","['Blood glucose', 'Blood pressure', 'Inter-relationship']",High blood pressure & cardiovascular prevention : the official journal of the Italian Society of Hypertension,2021-01-17,"[{'lastname': 'Nga', 'firstname': 'Tran Thi Thu', 'initials': 'TTT', 'affiliation': 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 23, Hobart, TAS, 7000, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Blizzard', 'firstname': 'Christopher Leigh', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 23, Hobart, TAS, 7000, Australia.

32247320",6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study.,"The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity.
We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5-6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences.
In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57·0 (IQR 47·0-65·0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186·0 (175·0-199·0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5-6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5-6, and median CT scores were 3·0 (IQR 2·0-5·0) for severity scale 3, 4·0 (3·0-5·0) for scale 4, and 5·0 (4·0-6·0) for scale 5-6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1·61 (95% CI 0·80-3·25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4·60 (1·85-11·48) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0·88 (0·66-1·17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1·77 (1·05-2·97) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0·74 (0·58-0·96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2·69 (1·46-4·96) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96·2% vs 58·5%) and median titres (19·0 vs 10·0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1·73 m
At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

26123639",Social deprivation predicts adverse health outcomes after hospital admission with hip fracture in England.,"We found social deprivation to be associated with higher mortality in the year following hip fracture among men and women aged 60 years and older in England. In those who did survive, deprivation was associated with longer hospital stays and greater risk of subsequent emergency readmission particularly for patients with dementia.
Social deprivation predicts a range of adverse health outcomes; however, its impact on outcomes following hip fracture is not established. We examined the effect of area-level social deprivation on outcomes following hospital admission for hip fracture in England.
We used English Hospital Episodes Statistics linked to the National Hip Fracture Database (April 2011-March 2015) and Office for National Statistics mortality database, to identify patients aged 60+ years admitted with hip fracture. Deprivation was measured using Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles; Q1-least deprived; Q5-most deprived, and outcomes by mortality over 1-year, length-of-stay in NHS acute and rehabilitation hospitals ('superspell'), and emergency 30-day readmission.
We identified 218,907 admissions with an index hip fracture (mean age 82.8 [standard deviation, SD 8.4] years; 72.6% female). Each quintile of deprivation was associated with greater mortality; age-adjusted 30-day mortality odds ratio, OR 1.30 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.24, 1.37], p < 0.001, equating to on average 1038 fewer deaths/year among those who are least deprived (Q1 versus 2-5). Similarly, at 365 days, those most deprived had 24% higher mortality (age-sex-comorbidity-adjusted OR:1.24 [1.20, 1.28], p < 0.001; Q5 versus Q1). Among survivors, mean superspell was longer in the most versus least deprived (Q5:24.4 [SD 21.7] days, Q1:23.3 [SD 22.1], p < 0.001). Readmission was more common in those most versus least deprived (age-sex-comorbidity-adjusted OR 1.27 [1.22, 1.32], p < 0.001).
Greater deprivation is associated with reduced survival at all timepoints in the year following hip fracture. Among survivors, hospital stay is increased as is readmission risk. The extent to which configuration of English hospital services, rather than patient case-mix, explains these apparent health inequalities remains to be determined.","['Epidemiology', 'Health inequality', 'Health outcomes', 'IMD—Index of Multiple Deprivation', 'Neck of femur']",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2021-01-06,"[{'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Musculoskeletal Research Unit, Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK. rita.patel@bristol.ac.uk.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhimjiyani', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ben-Shlomo', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gregson', 'firstname': 'C L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Musculoskeletal Research Unit, Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}]",,"Greater deprivation is associated with reduced survival at all timepoints in the year following hip fracture.

18259005","Associations between arterial stiffening and brain structure, perfusion, and cognition in the Whitehall II Imaging Sub-study: A retrospective cohort study.","Aortic stiffness is closely linked with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but recent studies suggest that it is also a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. However, the brain changes underlying this risk are unclear. We examined whether aortic stiffening during a 4-year follow-up in mid-to-late life was associated with brain structure and cognition in the Whitehall II Imaging Sub-study.
The Whitehall II Imaging cohort is a randomly selected subset of the ongoing Whitehall II Study, for which participants have received clinical follow-ups for 30 years, across 12 phases. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in 2007-2009 (Phase 9) and at a 4-year follow-up in 2012-2013 (Phase 11). Between 2012 and 2016 (Imaging Phase), participants received a multimodal 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and cognitive tests. Participants were selected if they had no clinical diagnosis of dementia and no gross brain structural abnormalities. Voxel-based analyses were used to assess grey matter (GM) volume, white matter (WM) microstructure (fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity), white matter lesions (WMLs), and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Cognitive outcomes were performance on verbal memory, semantic fluency, working memory, and executive function tests. Of 542 participants, 444 (81.9%) were men. The mean (SD) age was 63.9 (5.2) years at the baseline Phase 9 examination, 68.0 (5.2) at Phase 11, and 69.8 (5.2) at the Imaging Phase. Voxel-based analysis revealed that faster rates of aortic stiffening in mid-to-late life were associated with poor WM microstructure, viz. lower FA, higher mean, and radial diffusivity (RD) in 23.9%, 11.8%, and 22.2% of WM tracts, respectively, including the corpus callosum, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and corticospinal tracts. Similar voxel-wise associations were also observed with follow-up aortic stiffness. Moreover, lower mean global FA was associated with faster rates of aortic stiffening (B = -5.65, 95% CI -9.75, -1.54, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.0125) and higher follow-up aortic stiffness (B = -1.12, 95% CI -1.95, -0.29, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.0125). In a subset of 112 participants who received arterial spin labelling scans, faster aortic stiffening was also related to lower cerebral perfusion in 18.4% of GM, with associations surviving Bonferroni corrections in the frontal (B = -10.85, 95% CI -17.91, -3.79, p < 0.0125) and parietal lobes (B = -12.75, 95% CI -21.58, -3.91, p < 0.0125). No associations with GM volume or WMLs were observed. Further, higher baseline aortic stiffness was associated with poor semantic fluency (B = -0.47, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.18, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.007) and verbal learning outcomes (B = -0.36, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.12, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.007). As with all observational studies, it was not possible to infer causal associations. The generalisability of the findings may be limited by the gender imbalance, high educational attainment, survival bias, and lack of ethnic and socioeconomic diversity in this cohort.
Our findings indicate that faster rates of aortic stiffening in mid-to-late life were associated with poor brain WM microstructural integrity and reduced cerebral perfusion, likely due to increased transmission of pulsatile energy to the delicate cerebral microvasculature. Strategies to prevent arterial stiffening prior to this point may be required to offer cognitive benefit in older age.

449,33368318,A population-based cross-sectional study of the association between periodontitis and arterial stiffness among the older Japanese population.,"To investigate the potential association between periodontitis and arterial stiffness among the older Japanese population.
The prevalence of periodontitis is increasing in Japanese older adults. Arterial stiffness increases the risks of cardiovascular events and death, morbidity, and dementia.
This secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study evaluated the periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA), reflecting the amount of inflamed periodontal tissue that was estimated by a full-mouth periodontal examination. Severe periodontitis was defined per the parameters provided by the Centers for Disease Control/American Academy of Periodontology. The Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) was used for measuring the overall stiffness of the artery, and higher CAVI indicated increased arterial stiffness. An ordinal logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between periodontitis and arterial stiffness.
The analysis included 185 Japanese adults [35% men; age, mean (standard deviation) 80.2 (4.4) years]. The average PISA and the prevalence of severe periodontitis were 64.4 mm
Periodontitis was associated with arterial stiffness among Japanese older adults. Further studies are needed to investigate whether arterial stiffness is an intermediate factor in the pathway between periodontitis and systemic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and dementia.","['aged', 'atherosclerosis', 'epidemiology', 'periodontal diseases']",Journal of periodontal research,2020-12-29,"[{'lastname': 'Iwasaki', 'firstname': 'Masanori', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Itabashi-ku, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kimura', 'firstname': 'Yumi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Human Sciences, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamaga', 'firstname': 'Takayuki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral Health, Matsumoto Dental University, Shiojiri, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'Naomune', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Innovation, Aino University Junior College, Ibaraki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ishikawa', 'firstname': 'Motonao', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Wada', 'firstname': 'Taizo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sakamoto', 'firstname': 'Ryota', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ishimoto', 'firstname': 'Yasuko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health and Sports Science, Faculty of Health Science and Technology, Kawasaki University of Medical Welfare, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujisawa', 'firstname': 'Michiko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okumiya', 'firstname': 'Kiyohito', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Otsuka', 'firstname': 'Kuniaki', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Matsubayashi', 'firstname': 'Kozo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ogawa', 'firstname': 'Hiroshi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Preventive Dentistry, Department of Oral Health Science, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.'}]",,"Periodontitis was associated with arterial stiffness among Japanese older adults.

18310553","Impact of Social Isolation on the Behavioral, Functional Profiles, and Hippocampal Atrophy Asymmetry in Dementia in Times of Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19): A Translational Neuroscience Approach.","The impact of COVID-19 on the elderly is devastating, and nursing homes are struggling to provide the best care to the most fragile. The urgency and severity of the pandemic forces the use of segregation in restricted areas and confinement in individual rooms as desperate strategies to avoid the spread of disease and the worst-case scenario of becoming a deadly trap. The conceptualization of the post-COVID-19 era implies strong efforts to redesign all living conditions, care/rehabilitation interventions, and management of loneliness forced by social distance measures. Recently, a study of gender differences in COVID-19 found that men are more likely to suffer more severe effects of the disease and are over twice as likely to die. It is well-known that dementia is associated with increased mortality, and males have worse survival and deranged neuro-immuno-endocrine systems than females. The present study examines the impact of long-term isolation in male 3xTg-AD mice modeling advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and as compared to age-matched counterparts with normal aging. We used a battery of ethological and unconditioned tests resembling several areas in nursing homes. The main findings refer to an exacerbated (two-fold increase) hyperactivity and emergence of bizarre behaviors in isolated 3xTg-AD mice, worrisome results since agitation is a challenge in the clinical management of dementia and an important cause of caregiver burden. This increase was consistently shown in gross (activity in most of the tests) and fine (thermoregulatory nesting) motor functions. Isolated animals also exhibited re-structured anxiety-like patterns and coping-with-stress strategies. Bodyweight and kidney weight loss were found in AD-phenotypes and increased by isolation. Spleen weight loss was isolation dependent. Hippocampal tau pathology was not modified, but asymmetric atrophy of the hippocampus, recently described in human patients with dementia and modeled here for the first time in an animal model of AD, was found to increase with isolation. Overall, the results show awareness of the impact of isolation in elderly patients with dementia, offering some guidance from translational neuroscience in these times of coronavirus and post-COVID-19 pandemic. They also highlight the relevance of personalized-based interventions tailored to the heterogeneous and complex clinical profile of the individuals with dementia and to consider the implications on caregiver burden.","['animal models-rodent', 'brain asymmetry', 'confinement', 'gender', 'isolation', 'neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia', 'nursery homes', 'risk factors']",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020-12-18,"[{'lastname': 'Muntsant', 'firstname': 'Aida', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nInstitut de Neurociències, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Giménez-Llort', 'firstname': 'Lydia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nInstitut de Neurociències, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}]",,,,Copyright © 2020 Muntsant and Giménez-Llort.,"10.3389/fpsyt.2020.572583

451,33327915,"Statins, Risk of Death and Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Dementia: A Registry-Based Observational Cohort Study.","Survival in patients with dementia is variable. Statins are a cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention. However, the effect of statins on mortality and risk for stroke in patients with dementia is not clear.
The aim of the study was to analyse the association between the use of statins and the risk of all-cause death and first ischemic stroke in patients diagnosed with dementia.
A longitudinal cohort study of 48 771 patients based on combined Swedish registries was conducted. The association between the incident use of statins one year prior to dementia diagnosis, allcause mortality and first ischemic stroke was examined using propensity score-matched flexible parametric or Cox hazard survival models and is presented with hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
After propensity score matching, incident users of statins (n=1412) had a lower risk of all-cause death (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.91) and ischemic stroke (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89) compared to matched non-users (n=4482). In stratified analysis, the protective association between incident statin use and survival was observed in men, patients older than 75 years, with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Furthermore, we observed a protective association between incident use of statins and first ischemic stroke risk in men, patients older than 75 years and with mixed dementia. There was a graded association between cumulative doses of statins and mortality.
The use of statins might be beneficial for the survival and ischemic stroke risk in patients with dementia in a dose-dependent manner.","[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors', 'Statins', 'death', 'dementia', 'mortality', 'stroke']",Current Alzheimer research,2020-12-18,"[{'lastname': 'Petek', 'firstname': 'Bojana', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurogeriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Hong', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Villa-Lopez', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Winblad', 'firstname': 'Bengt', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurogeriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kramberger', 'firstname': 'Milica G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurogeriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Eriksdotter', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia-Ptacek', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}]",,The use of statins might be beneficial for the survival and ischemic stroke risk in patients with dementia in a dose-dependent manner.,"After propensity score matching, incident users of statins (n=1412) had a lower risk of all-cause death (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.91) and ischemic stroke (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89) compared to matched non-users (n=4482).

23799051","A comparison of the prevalence of and modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment among community-dwelling Canadian seniors over two decades, 1991-2009.","The prevalence of cognitive impairment or dementia is of public health concern globally. Accurate estimates of this debilitating condition are needed for future public health policy planning. In this study, we estimate prevalence and modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment by sex over approximately 16 years.
Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) baseline data conducted between 1991-1992 were used to measure the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia among adults aged 65+ years. The standard Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) was used for the screening test for cognitive impairment. We compared the CSHA data with Canadian Community Health Survey-Healthy Aging (CCHS-HA) conducted between 2008-2009. The CCHS-HA used a four-dimension cognitive module to screen for cognitive impairment. Only survey community-dwelling respondents were included in the final sample. After applying exclusion criteria, final samples of (N = 8504) respondents in the CSHA sample and (N = 7764) respondents for CCHS-HA sample were analyzed. To account for changes in the age structure of the Canadian population, prevalence estimates were calculated using age-sex standardization to the 2001 population census of Canada. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine predictors of cognitive impairment. A sex stratified analysis was used to examine risk factors for cognitive impairment in the survey samples.
We found that prevalence of cognitive impairment among respondents in CSHA sample was 15.5% in 1991 while a prevalence of 10.8% was reported in the CCHS-HA sample in 2009, a 4.7% reduction [15.5% (CI = 14.8-16.3), CSHA vs 10.8% (CI = 10.1-11.5), CCHS-HA]. Men reported higher prevalence of cognitive impairment in CSHA study (16.0%) while women reported higher prevalence of cognitive impairment in CCHS-HA (11.6%). In the multivariable analyses, risk factors such as age, poor self-rated health, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and hearing problems were common to both cohorts. Sex differences in risk factors were also noted.
This study provides suggestive evidence of a potential reduction in the occurrence of cognitive impairment among community-dwelling Canadian seniors despite the aging of the Canadian population. The moderating roles of improved prevention and treatment of vascular morbidity and improvements in the levels of education of the Canadian population are possible explanations for this decrease in the cognitive impairment.",[],PloS one,2020-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'Chireh', 'firstname': 'Batholomew', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Saskatchewan Health Quality Council, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Arcy"", 'firstname': 'Carl', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and School of Public Health, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.'}]",,,"We found that prevalence of cognitive impairment among respondents in CSHA sample was 15.5% in 1991 while a prevalence of 10.8% was reported in the CCHS-HA sample in 2009, a 4.7% reduction [15.5% (CI = 14.8-16.3), CSHA vs 10.8% (CI = 10.1-11.5), CCHS-HA].

453,33322877,Deaths after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in Norway.,"Advanced age is the most important risk factor for death as a result of COVID-19, but there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the impact of chronic diseases. Using health registry data, we describe the disease profiles of persons who died after a confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the first three months of the pandemic in Norway.
Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR) and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) were linked to information on positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) and on deaths from the National Population Register. The data retrieval included the Norwegian population as of 1 March 2020 with data for confirmed infections, hospitalisations and deaths until 31 May 2020.
Of 8 412 persons with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, altogether 244 (2.9 %) died, whereof 133 (55 %) were men. Among those with a confirmed infection, the proportion who died varied from 0.2 % (age < 60 years) to 52 % (age ≥ 90 years). Altogether 92 (38 %) patients died in hospital. 25 (16 %) of those who died elsewhere had previously been hospitalised for COVID-19. The proportion with no registered chronic disease was 39 % in the age group < 70 years and 26 % in the age group ≥ 70 years. The disease distribution varied between those patients who had died in and outside of hospital, especially for diagnoses of diabetes, renal failure and dementia.
Among those who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed during the first three months of the pandemic in Norway, only a small proportion died. The majority of those who died were 70 years or older and had at least one chronic disease, but the disease profile varied between patients who died in and outside of hospital.

454,33307330,Sex differences in risk factors for white matter hyperintensities in non-demented older individuals.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are generally considered to be associated with cerebral small vessel disease, especially, in older age. Although significant sex differences have been reported in the severity of WMH, it is not yet known if the risk factors for WMH differ in men and women. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging brain scans from 2 Australian cohorts were analyzed to extract WMH volumes. The objective of this study is to examine the moderation effect by sex in the association between known risk factors and WMH. The burden of WMH was significantly higher in women compared to men, especially in the deep WMH (DWMH). In the generalized linear model that included the interaction between sex and body mass index (BMI), there was a differential association of BMI with DWMH in men and women in the exploratory sample, that is, the Sydney Memory and Aging Study, n = 432, aged between 70 and 90. The finding of a higher BMI associated with a higher DWMH in men compared to women was replicated in the Older Australian Twins Study sample, n = 179, aged between 65 and 90. The risk factors of WMH pathology are suggested to have a different impact on the aging brains of men and women.","['Aging', 'Body mass index (BMI)', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Neuroimaging', 'Obesity', 'Sex differences', 'White matter hyperintensity (WMH)']",Neurobiology of aging,2020-12-12,"[{'lastname': 'Alqarni', 'firstname': 'Abdullah', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), School of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Radiology and Medical Imaging Department, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia.

19188334",Delirium is associated with high mortality in older adult patients with acute decompensated heart failure.,"Delirium is associated with high mortality after cardiac surgery. However, evidence on the epidemiology of delirium in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is limited. This study aimed to assess the incidence and prognostic impact of delirium in patients with ADHF.
This single-center prospective observational study enrolled 132 consecutive patients with ADHF. We utilized the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition and classified the patients into two groups according to the presence or absence of delirium. The primary endpoint was 90-day all-cause mortality. The prognostic impact and risk factors of delirium were evaluated using multivariable Cox and logistic regression analyses, respectively.
The median patient age was 83 (interquartile range, 75-87) years. Approximately 51.5% were men. Delirium occurred in 36 (27.3%) patients, and hyperactive delirium was the most frequent type (86.1%). The 90-day all-cause mortality was higher in the patients with delirium than in those without (21.6% versus 3.9%, log-rank p = 0.002). Delirium was associated with higher mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio of 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-42.6, p = 0.042). The risk factors associated with delirium included advanced age, male sex, higher clinical frailty scale score, and dementia.
Delirium was associated with a higher 90-day all-cause mortality in the older adult patients with ADHF.

32302278",Clinical Suspicion of COVID-19 in Nursing Home Residents: Symptoms and Mortality Risk Factors.,"To describe the symptomatology, mortality, and risk factors for mortality in a large group of Dutch nursing home (NH) residents with clinically suspected COVID-19 who were tested with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.
Prospective cohort study.
Residents of Dutch NHs with clinically suspected COVID-19 and who received RT-PCR test.
We collected data of NH residents with clinically suspected COVID-19 via electronic health records between March 18 and May 13, 2020. Registration was performed on diagnostic status [confirmed (COVID-19+)/ruled out (COVID-19-)] and symptomatology (typical and atypical symptoms). Information on mortality and risk factors for mortality were extracted from usual care data.
In our sample of residents with clinically suspected COVID-19 (N = 4007), COVID-19 was confirmed in 1538 residents (38%). Although symptomatology overlapped between residents with COVID-19+ and COVID-19-, those with COVID-19+ were 3 times more likely to die within 30 days [hazard ratio (HR), 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-3.6]. Within this group, mortality was higher for men than for women (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), and we observed a higher mortality for residents with dementia, reduced kidney function, and Parkinson's disease, even when corrected for age, gender, and comorbidities.
About 40% of the residents with clinically suspected COVID-19 actually had COVID-19, based on the RT-PCR test. Despite an overlap in symptomatology, mortality rate was 3 times higher for residents with COVID-19+. This emphasizes the importance of using low-threshold testing in NH residents, which is an essential prerequisite to using limited personal protective equipment and isolation measures efficiently.","['Long-term care facility', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'cohort', 'survival analyses']",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2020-12-02,"[{'lastname': 'Rutten', 'firstname': 'Jeanine J S', 'initials': 'JJS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine for Older People, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

28546750",11β-Hydroxylase (CYP11B1) gene variants and new-onset depression in later life.,"Cumulative exposure to high glucocorticoid levels is detrimental for the brain and may have particular implications in later life. A feature of late-life depression is increased cortisol secretion. Variants in the CYP11B1 gene, which codes for the enzyme responsible for cortisol synthesis, could influence risk of late-life depression, but this hypothesis has not been examined. We investigated the associations between variants in the CYP11B1 gene and late-life depression, taking into account history of depression and potential sex-specific effects.
We assessed depression in 1007 community-dwellers aged 65 years or older (60% women) at baseline and over a 14-year follow-up. A clinical level of depression was defined as a score of ≥ 16 on the Centre for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale or a diagnosis of current major depression based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV). We examined incident and recurrent depression in participants without or with a history of major depression, respectively. We genotyped 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning CYP11B1. We used multivariable analyses to adjust for age, body mass index, cardiovascular ischemic pathologies, hypertension, cognitive impairment and anxiety.
In women, rs6471580 and rs7016924 were associated with a 50% lower rate of incident (new-onset) late-life depression, and rs11783855 was associated with a 2.4-fold higher rate of late-life depression. These associations remained after correction for multiple testing, but we found no associations for recurrent depression in women or men.
This study focused on the major gene involved in corticosteroid biosynthesis, but other genes may also be implicated in this pathway.

30049697",Clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with cervical spine fractures or with hip fractures.,"Patients admitted with a cervical fracture are twice as likely to die within 30 days of injury than those with a hip fracture. However, guidelines for the management of cervical fractures are less available than for hip fractures. We hypothesise that outcomes may differ between these types of fractures. We analysed 1359 patients (406 men, 953 women) with mean age of 83.8 years (standard deviation = 8.7) admitted to a National Health Service hospital in 2013-2019 with a cervical (7.5%) or hip fracture (92.5%) of similar age. The association of cervical fracture (hip fracture as reference), hospital length of stay (LOS), co-morbidities, age and sex with outcomes (acute delirium, new pressure ulcer, and discharge to residential/nursing care) was assessed by stepwise multivariate logistic regression. Acute delirium without history of dementia was increased with cervical fractures: odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-4.7, age ≥ 80 years: OR = 3.5 (95% CI = 1.9-6.4), history of stroke: OR = 1.8 (95% CI = 1.0-3.1) and ischaemic heart disease: OR = 1.9 (95% CI = 1.1-3.6); pressure ulcers was increased with cervical fractures: OR = 10.9 (95% CI = 5.3-22.7), LOS of 2-3 weeks: OR = 3.0 (95% CI = 1.2-7.5) and LOS of ≥ 3 weeks: OR = 4.9, 95% CI = 2.2-11.0; and discharge to residential/nursing care was increased with cervical fractures: OR = 3.2 (95% CI = 1.4-7.0), LOS of ≥ 3 weeks: OR = 4.4 (95% CI = 2.5-7.6), dementia: OR = 2.7 (95% CI = 1.6-4.7), Parkinson's disease: OR = 3.4 (95% CI = 1.3-8.8), and age ≥ 80 years: OR = 2.7 (95% CI = 1.3-5.6). In conclusion, compared with hip fracture, cervical fracture is more likely to associate with acute delirium and pressure ulcers, and for discharge to residency of high level of care, independent of established risk factors.","['Discharge destination', 'Geriatrics', 'Length of stay', 'Mortality', 'Pressure ulcers']",Internal and emergency medicine,2020-11-28,"[{'lastname': 'Baxter', 'firstname': 'Joshua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Birmingham Medical School, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Lisk', 'firstname': 'Radcliffe', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Orthogeriatrics, Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford Road, Chertsey, KT16 0PZ, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Osmani', 'firstname': 'Ahmad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Orthogeriatrics, Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford Road, Chertsey, KT16 0PZ, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Yeong', 'firstname': 'Keefai', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Orthogeriatrics, Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford Road, Chertsey, KT16 0PZ, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Robin', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford Road, Chertsey, KT16 0PZ, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Fluck', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Cardiology, Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford Road, Chertsey, KT16 0PZ, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Fry', 'firstname': 'Christopher Henry', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Thang Sieu', 'initials': 'TS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, TW20 0EX, Surrey, UK. thang.han@rhul.ac.uk.'}]",,,,© 2020.

31661195","Sarcopenia: prevalence, associated factors, and the risk of mortality and disability in Japanese older adults.","There is limited evidence on sarcopenia in Asian populations. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence, associated factors, and the magnitude of association with mortality and incident disability for sarcopenia and combinations of its components among Japanese community-dwelling older adults.
We conducted a 5.8 year prospective study of 1851 Japanese residents aged 65 years or older (50.5% women; mean age 72.0 ± 5.9) who participated in health check-ups. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 algorithm. Appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) was measured using direct segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify associations of sarcopenia and the combinations of its components with all-cause mortality and incident disability.
The prevalence of sarcopenia was 11.5% (105/917) in men and 16.7% (156/934) in women. Significant sarcopenia-related factors other than ageing were hypoalbuminaemia, cognitive impairment, low activity, and recent hospitalization (all P-values <0.05) among men and cognitive impairment (P = 0.004) and depressed mood (P < 0.001) among women. Individuals with sarcopenia had higher risks of mortality [hazard ratios (95% confidence interval): 2.0 (1.2-3.5) in men and 2.3 (1.1-4.9) in women] and incident disability [1.6 (1.0-2.7) in men and 1.7 (1.1-2.7) in women]. Compared with the individuals without any sarcopenia components, those having low grip strength and/or slow gait speed without low ALMI tended to have an increased risk of disability [1.4 (1.0-2.0), P = 0.087], but not mortality [1.3 (0.8-2.2)]. We did not find increased risks of these outcomes in participants having low ALMI in the absence of low grip strength and slow gait speed [1.2 (0.8-1.9) for mortality and 0.9 (0.6-1.3) for incident disability].
Japanese older men and women meeting Asian criteria of sarcopenia had increased risks of all-cause mortality and disability. There were no significant increased risks of death or incident disability for both participants with muscle weakness and/or low performance without low muscle mass and those with low muscle mass with neither muscle weakness nor low performance. Further studies are needed to examine the interaction between muscle loss, muscle weakness, and low performance for adverse health-related outcomes.","['Appendicular lean mass index', 'Community-based sample', 'Gait speed', 'Handgrip strength', 'Prospective study']","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",2020-11-27,"[{'lastname': 'Kitamura', 'firstname': 'Akihiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Seino', 'firstname': 'Satoshi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Abe', 'firstname': 'Takumi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.\nCentre for Urban Transitions, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Nofuji', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yokoyama', 'firstname': 'Yuri', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Amano', 'firstname': 'Hidenori', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nishi', 'firstname': 'Mariko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Taniguchi', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.\nCenter for Health and Environmental Risk Research, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Ibaraki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Narita', 'firstname': 'Miki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujiwara', 'firstname': 'Yoshinori', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shinkai', 'firstname': 'Shoji', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}]",,,"The prevalence of sarcopenia was 11.5% (105/917) in men and 16.7% (156/934) in women.

19472051",Possible role of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor for predicting cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: a case-control study.,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays an important role in the protection of dopaminergic neurons, but there are few reports of the relationship between GDNF and its precursors (α-pro-GDNF and β-pro-GDNF) and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the serum levels of GDNF and its precursors and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, and to assess their potential as a diagnostic marker. Fifty-three primary outpatients and hospitalized patients with Parkinson's disease (23 men and 30 women) with an average age of 66.58 years were enrolled from the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University of China in this case-control study. The patients were divided into the Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment group (n = 27) and the Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function group (n = 26) based on their Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. In addition, 26 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were included as the healthy control group. Results demonstrated that serum GDNF levels were significantly higher in the Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function group than in the other two groups. There were no significant differences in GDNF precursor levels among the three groups. Correlation analysis revealed that serum GDNF levels, GDNF/α-pro-GDNF ratios, and GDNF/β-pro-GDNF ratios were moderately or highly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. To explore the risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease, logistic regression analysis and stepwise linear regression analysis were performed. Both GDNF levels and Hoehn-Yahr stage were risk factors for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, and were the common influencing factors for cognitive scale scores. Neither α-pro-GDNF nor β-pro-GDNF was risk factors for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. A receiver operating characteristic curve of GDNF was generated to predict cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (area under the curve = 0.859). This result indicates that the possibility that serum GDNF can correctly distinguish whether patients with Parkinson's disease have cognitive impairment is 0.859. Together, these results suggest that serum GDNF may be an effective diagnostic marker for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. However, α-pro-GDNF and β-pro-GDNF are not useful for predicting cognitive impairment in this disease. This study was approved by Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, China (approval No. XYFY2017-KL047-01) on November 30, 2017.","['GDNF', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'biomarkers', 'cognition', 'factors', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurons', 'risk factors\n']",Neural regeneration research,2020-11-25,"[{'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Ming-Yu', 'initials': 'MY', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou; Department of Neurology, the First People's Hospital of Yancheng, Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Cheng-Cheng', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Xuzhou Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Fang-Fang', 'initials': 'FF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, Suqian First People's Hospital, Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Yu', 'initials': 'XY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xue', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Operating Room, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Chuan-Xi', 'initials': 'CX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Xuzhou Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Lin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Xuzhou Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Dian-Shuai', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Xuzhou Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.'}]",,,,,10.4103/1673-5374.297091,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05dd61f270>,,,,,,

Previous work largely considered the effects of sex and menopause as being independent of age. We studied whether age interacts with sex or menopause in explaining imaging biomarkers of dementia during midlife.
In this cross-sectional study of UK Biobank participants with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we explored the interaction of age with sex or menopausal status in explaining total brain volume (TBV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), regional cortical volume , and subcortical volume.
Data were available for 1827 postmenopausal women, 230 pre/perimenopausal women and 2165 men (median age 63.3 years). There was a significant interaction between age and sex (P = .024) for TBV, where the inverse association age with TBV was steeper in women (β = -5.35 mL/year) than in men (β = -4.77 mL/year). Similar age-sex interactions were also observed for GMV and WMV. In women, there was a significant interaction between age and menopausal status (P = .007) where the inverse association of age with TBV was steeper in postmenopausal (β = -5.89 mL/year) than in pre/perimenopausal women (β = -1.61 mL/year). Similar age-menopause interactions were found in predicting lower GMV and higher WMHV. Differences in the direction of these age-sex and age-menopause interactions were found for regional cortical and subcortical brain volumes.
Sex and menopause both interact with age during midlife in explaining MRI biomarkers of dementia. Further work is required to understand the mechanisms driving these interactions to develop strategies for delaying dementia.","['MRI', 'all cognitive disorders/dementia', 'menopause', 'risk factors in epidemiology', 'sex differences']",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2020-11-19,"[{'lastname': 'Than', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Peninsula Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Moran', 'firstname': 'Chris', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Peninsula Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Beare', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.\nDevelopmental Imaging, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Vincent', 'firstname': 'Amanda J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Monash Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Collyer', 'firstname': 'Taya A', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, Cabrini Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Callisaya', 'firstname': 'Michele L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.\nMenzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomson', 'firstname': 'Russell', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Research in Mathematics, Western Sydney University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Phan', 'firstname': 'Thanh G', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Stroke and Aging Research Group, School of Clinical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fornito', 'firstname': 'Alex', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Monash Biomedical Imaging, School of Psychological Science, Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Srikanth', 'firstname': 'Velandai K', 'initials': 'VK', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit, Peninsula Clinical School, Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Peninsula Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}]",,Sex and menopause both interact with age during midlife in explaining MRI biomarkers of dementia.

462,33201033,Age-Related Changes in the Association Between Traumatic Brain Injury and Dementia in Older Men and Women.,"To investigate age-related changes in the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and dementia in older men and women separately.
A total of 243 general practices in the UK.
This study included 4760 patients who received a first TBI diagnosis between 1995 and 2010 (index date), and 4760 patients without TBI who were matched to those with TBI by age, sex, index year, Charlson Comorbidity Index, alcohol dependence, and physician (index date: a randomly selected visit date).
Retrospective cohort study.
Incidence of dementia in the decade following index date.
Within 10 years of index date, 8.8% of men with TBI and 4.8% of those without TBI were diagnosed with dementia, while the respective figures were 9.0% and 6.7% in women (P values < .01). There was a significant association between TBI and dementia in men (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-3.19) and in women (HR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.07-1.64). Furthermore, the association between TBI and dementia was significant in men aged 60 to 70 (HR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.27-4.96) and 71 to 80 years (HR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.82-4.93), whereas the relationship was only significant and potentially unreliable in women aged 81 to 90 years (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03-2.14).

24722122",COVID-19 outcomes in UK centre within highest health and wealth band: a prospective cohort study.,"To describe the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 from UK in the highest decile of health and gross regional products per capita.
Prospective cohort study.
Recruited all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 symptoms admitted to a single Surrey centre between March and April 2020. Extensive demographic details were documented.
COVID-19 status of alive/dead and intensive care unit (ICU) status of yes/no.
Patients with COVID-19 from Surrey centre UK (n=429).
429 adult inpatients (mean age 70±18 years; men 56.4%) were included in this study, of whom, 19.1% required admission to ICU and 31.9% died. Adverse outcomes were associated with age (OR with each decade of years: 1.78, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.11, p<0.001 for mortality); male gender (OR=1.08, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.63, p=0.72, present in 70.7%, of admissions to ICU versus 53% of other cases, p=0.004); cardiac disease (OR=3.43, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.63, p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR=2.37, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.17, p=0.028) and dementia (OR=5.06, 95% CI 2.79 to 9.44, p<0.001). There was no significant impact of ethnicity or body mass index on disease outcome.
Despite reports of worse outcomes in deprived regions, we show similar complication and mortality rates due to COVID-19 in an affluent and high life expectancy region.","['COVID-19', 'epidemiology', 'public health']",BMJ open,2020-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Ken-Dror', 'firstname': 'Gie', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Royal Holloway University of London, Egham, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wade', 'firstname': 'Charles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Shyam', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Law', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Division of Medicine, Ashford and Saint Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Chertsey, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Russo', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Division of Medicine, Ashford and Saint Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Chertsey, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Aarti', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Joy', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Division of Medicine, Ashford and Saint Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Chertsey, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'John', 'firstname': 'Joshua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Kings College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Robin', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Division of Medicine, Ashford and Saint Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Chertsey, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'John', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahana', 'firstname': 'Karim', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Division of Medicine, Ashford and Saint Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Chertsey, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Fluck', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Division of Medicine, Ashford and Saint Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Chertsey, Surrey, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Bentley', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Pankaj', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Royal Holloway University of London, Egham, UK pankaj.sharma@rhul.ac.uk.\nDepartment of Clinical Neuroscience, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.'}]",,,"429 adult inpatients (mean age 70±18 years; men 56.4%) were included in this study, of whom, 19.1% required admission to ICU and 31.9% died.

465,33183388,Alcohol consumption and sleep quality: a community-based study.,"To assess the association between total alcohol intake, specific alcoholic beverages and sleep quality in a community-based cohort.
A cross-sectional study.
The Kailuan community, China.
Included were 11 905 participants who were free of a history of CVD, cancer, Parkinson's disease, dementia and head injury in or prior to 2012. Alcohol consumption (amount and frequency intake) and alcoholic beverage type were collected in 2006 (baseline) and 2012. Participants were grouped into non-, light- (women: 0-0·4 serving/d; men: 0-0·9 serving/d), moderate- (women: 0·5-1·0 serving/d; men: 1·0-2·0 servings/d) and heavy- (women: >1·0 servings/d; men: >2·0 servings/d) drinkers. Overall sleep quality was measured in 2012 and included four sleep parameters (insomnia, daytime sleepiness, sleep duration, snoring/obstructive sleep apnoea).
We observed a dose-response association between higher alcohol consumption in 2006 and worse sleep quality in 2012 (Ptrend < 0·001), after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, plasma lipid profiles, diabetes and hypertension. A similar association was observed when alcohol consumption in 2012 was used as exposure. Alcohol was associated with higher odds of having short sleep duration (adjusted OR for heavy- v. non-drinkers = 1·31; 95 % CI: 1·09, 1·57) and snoring (adjusted OR for heavy- v. non-drinkers: 1·38; 95 % CI: 1·22, 1·57). Consumption of hard liquor, but not beer or wine, was significantly associated with poor sleep quality.

The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and ascertain dementia eight-item informant questionnaire (AD8)-validated Ecuador Spanish versions were used to assess cognition. Results There were a total of 80 participants, 55 (67%) women and 25 (31.2%) men. The majority of participants were Mestizos (85.3%), with the remainder classified as White (4.8%), Afro-Ecuadorians (2.4%), or Indigenous (3.6%). The prevalence of cognitive impairment is 30.0%-43.7%. The MMSE results showed that older age and lack of education are risk factors for cognitive decline (p < 0.01). There was high correlation between MMSE and AD8 scores. The AD8 showed that older age, widowhood, and living in Santa Rosa were risk factors for cognitive decline (p < 0.01). According to the AD8, the group with the highest education (six years or more) had the lowest risk of cognitive decline and dementia (p < 0.01).  Conclusions The main risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia in individuals above 65 years old in Santa Cruz Island, Galápagos, Ecuador are increased age, lack of education, and widowhood. The prevalence of cognitive impairment is similar to previous studies in Ecuador.","['alzheimer’s dementia', 'cognitive decline', 'dementia', 'galapagos', 'memory loss']",Cureus,2020-11-12,"[{'lastname': 'Espinosa Del Pozo', 'firstname': 'Patricio H', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Neuroscience, Universidad Central del Ecuador, Quito, ECU.'}, {'lastname': 'Espinosa', 'firstname': 'Patricio S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': 'Neurology, Marcus Neuroscience Institute, Boca Raton Regional Hospital Baptist Health System, Boca Raton, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Donadi', 'firstname': 'Eduardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Departamento De Clinica, Facultad De Medicina Ribeirão Preto, Universidad De São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, BRA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rogel', 'firstname': 'Lenin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Educación y Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Central del Ecuador, Santa Cruz, ECU.'}, {'lastname': 'Naranjo', 'firstname': 'Raquel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Neurosciences Unit, College of Medical Sciences, Central University of Ecuador, Quito, ECU.'}, {'lastname': 'Haro', 'firstname': 'Gabriela E', 'initials': 'GE', 'affiliation': 'Neurosciences Unit, College of Medical Sciences, Central University of Ecuador, Quito, ECU.'}, {'lastname': 'Riera', 'firstname': 'Diana C', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': 'Neurosciences Unit, College of Medical Sciences, Central University of Ecuador, Quito, ECU.'}, {'lastname': 'Mendoza', 'firstname': 'Gabriela S', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Neurosciences Unit, College of Medical Sciences, Central University of Ecuador, Quito, ECU.'}, {'lastname': 'Garzón', 'firstname': 'Nicole A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Neurosciences Unit, College of Medical Sciences, Central University of Ecuador, Quito, ECU.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrade', 'firstname': 'Nicolas F', 'initials': 'NF', 'affiliation': 'Biological Sciences, Webster University, St. Louis, USA.'}]",,,,"Copyright © 2020, Espinosa del Pozo et al.",10.7759/cureus.10826,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df689310>,,,,,,
467,33167835,Association of Cerebrospinal Fluid Adiponectin Levels With Cerebral Glucose Metabolism In Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study.,"Adiponectin has been implicated in the pathophysiology of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. However, the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) adiponectin levels and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging remains unclear.
To explore whether CSF adiponectin levels are associated with 
Thirty-four amnestic MCI subjects underwent PiB-PET, FDG-PET, and CSF analysis. The CSF adiponectin levels were measured using the Bio-Plex 200 suspension array system. PET uptake was assessed for the frontal and temporoparietal lobes and posterior cingulate gyrus, referenced against the cerebellar cortex. The increased brain amyloid burden was defined as a mean uptake value ratio greater than 1.4.

28906205",Physiological determinants of residual cerebral arterial pulsatility on best medical treatment after TIA or minor stroke.,"Cerebral arterial pulsatility is strongly associated with cerebral small vessel disease and lacunar stroke yet its dependence on central versus local haemodynamic processes is unclear. In a population-based study of patients on best medical managment, 4-6 weeks after a TIA or non-disabling stroke, arterial stiffness and aortic systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures were measured (Sphygmocor). Middle cerebral artery peak and trough flow velocities and Gosling's pulsatility index were measured by transcranial ultrasound. In 981 participants, aortic and cerebral pulsatility rose strongly with age in both sexes, but aortic diastolic pressure fell more with age in men whilst cerebral trough velocity fell more in women. There was no significant association between aortic systolic or diastolic blood pressure with cerebral peak or trough flow velocity but aortic pulse pressure explained 37% of the variance in cerebral arterial pulsatility, before adjustment, whilst 49% of the variance was explained by aortic pulse pressure, arterial stiffness, age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, arterial stiffness partially mediated the relationship between aortic and cerebral pulsatility. Overall, absolute aortic pressures and cerebral blood flow velocity were poorly correlated but aortic and cerebral pulsatility were strongly related, suggesting a key role for transmission of aortic pulsatility to the brain.","['Arterial stiffness', 'age', 'aortic blood pressure', 'cerebral pulsatility', 'small vessel disease']",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2020-11-07,"[{'lastname': 'Webb', 'firstname': 'Alastair Js', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Lawson', 'firstname': 'Amy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Linxin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mazzucco', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rothwell', 'firstname': 'Peter M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}]",,,,,10.1177/0271678X20969984,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x7f05df1999f0>,,,,,,

31943973",Association of Circulating Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 Levels With Cardiovascular Mortality: A Meta-analysis of Population-Based Studies.,"Human genetics and studies in experimental models support a key role of monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in atherosclerosis. Yet, the associations of circulating MCP-1 levels with risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular death in the general population remain largely unexplored.
To explore whether circulating levels of MCP-1 are associated with risk of incident coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality in the general population.
Population-based cohort studies, identified through a systematic review, that have examined associations of circulating MCP-1 levels with cardiovascular end points.
Using a prespecified harmonized analysis plan, study-specific summary data were obtained from Cox regression models after excluding individuals with overt cardiovascular disease at baseline. Derived hazard ratios (HRs) were synthesized using random-effects meta-analyses.
Incident coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina), nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death (from cardiac or cerebrovascular causes).
The meta-analysis included 7 cohort studies involving 21 401 individuals (mean [SD] age, 53.7 [10.2] years; 10 012 men [46.8%]). Mean (SD) follow-up was 15.3 (4.5) years (326 392 person-years at risk). In models adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, higher MCP-1 levels at baseline were associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (HR per 1-SD increment in MCP-1 levels: 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01-1.11]; P = .01), nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.13]; P = .02), and cardiovascular death (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.05-1.20]; P < .001). In analyses comparing MCP-1 quartiles, these associations followed dose-response patterns. After additionally adjusting for vascular risk factors, the risk estimates were attenuated, but the associations of MCP-1 levels with cardiovascular death remained statistically significant, as did the association of MCP-1 levels in the upper quartile with coronary heart disease. There was no significant heterogeneity; the results did not change in sensitivity analyses excluding events occurring in the first 5 years after MCP-1 measurement, and the risk estimates were stable after additional adjustments for circulating levels of interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.
Higher circulating MCP-1 levels are associated with higher long-term cardiovascular mortality in community-dwelling individuals free of overt cardiovascular disease. These findings provide further support for a key role of MCP-1-signaling in cardiovascular disease.",[],JAMA cardiology,2020-11-05,"[{'lastname': 'Georgakis', 'firstname': 'Marios K', 'initials':

21948769",Gender-Based Pathways to Cognitive Aging in the Mexican-Origin Population in the United States: The Significance of Work and Family.,"This study uses the life course perspective to explore the role of key midlife factors (occupation and number of children) for gender- and nativity-based pathways to cognitive aging for older Mexican Americans.
Using the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE, 1993/1994-2016, n = 2,779), this study presents (a) cognitive impairment trajectories over 20 years of data and (b) multinomial logistic regression analyses of trajectory group membership by lifetime occupation and number of children, controlling for educational attainment.
For older Mexican American men, lifetime employment in agricultural occupations is associated with elevated risk for late-life cognitive impairment. Delayed risk for impairment is observed for U.S.-born men who were employed in factory work (e.g., production and repair) and in Mexican-born men who were employed in occupations with skilled or supervisory requirements. For all women, labor force participation, especially in skilled occupations, is related to a delayed risk of cognitive impairment. Number of children is unrelated to impairment for men; however, women with five or more children (compared to women with two to four children) are at risk for consistent and rapid cognitive impairment in late life.
Late-life cognitive health disparities that disproportionately impact the Mexican American population can be addressed by improving access to educational and occupational opportunities in early and midlife. This study points to key areas of intervention within work and the home for the Mexican-origin population.","['Dementia', 'Latinos', 'Life course']","The journals of gerontology.

28364542",Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Mortality in Very Old Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in Spain.,"Advanced age is a well-known risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19. However, few studies have specifically focused on very old inpatients with COVID-19. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of very old inpatients with COVID-19 and identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality at admission.
We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, retrospective, observational study in patients ≥ 80 years hospitalized with COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals (SEMI-COVID-19) Registry (March 1-May 29, 2020). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A uni- and multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of mortality at admission.
A total of 2772 consecutive patients (49.4% men, median age 86.3 years) were analyzed. Rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, dementia, and Barthel Index < 60 were 30.8%, 25.6%, 30.5%, and 21.0%, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate was 46.9% (n: 1301) and increased with age (80-84 years: 41.6%; 85-90 years: 47.3%; 90-94 years: 52.7%; ≥95 years: 54.2%). After analysis, male sex and moderate-to-severe dependence were independently associated with in-hospital mortality; comorbidities were not predictive. At admission, independent risk factors for death were: oxygen saturation < 90%; temperature ≥ 37.8°C; quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score ≥ 2; and unilateral-bilateral infiltrates on chest x-rays. Some analytical findings were independent risk factors for death, including estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 500 U/L; C-reactive protein ≥ 80 mg/L; neutrophils ≥ 7.5 × 103/μL; lymphocytes < 0.8 × 103/μL; and monocytes < 0.5 × 103/μL.
This first large, multicenter cohort of very old inpatients with COVID-19 shows that age, male sex, and poor preadmission functional status-not comorbidities-are independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Severe COVID-19 at admission is related to poor prognosis.","['Age ≥ 80', 'COVID-19', 'Mortality', 'Prognostic factors', 'SARS-CoV-2']","The journals of gerontology.

28826176",Dementia in late-onset epilepsy: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.,"To determine the risk of dementia after the development of late-onset epilepsy.
We used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study, which started in 1987 to 1989 with 15,792 mostly Black and White men and women from 4 US communities. We identified late-onset epilepsy (LOE; seizures starting at age 67 or later) from linked Medicare claims data. We used a Cox proportional hazards regression model to evaluate associations between LOE and dementia through 2017 as ascertained from neuropsychological testing, interviews, and hospital discharge surveillance, and we used multinomial logistic regression to assess the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in the subset with full neuropsychological assessments available. We adjusted for demographics and vascular and Alzheimer disease risk factors.
Of 9,033 ARIC participants with sufficient Medicare coverage data (4,980 [55.1%] female, 1993 [22.1%] Black), 671 met the definition of LOE. Two hundred seventy-nine (41.6%) participants with and 1,408 (16.8%) without LOE developed dementia (
The risk of incident dementia is substantially elevated in individuals with LOE.

28633297",Does sauna bathing protect against dementia?,"Repeated heat exposure like sauna bathing is suggested to beneficially affect against dementia development. The epidemiological evidence is, however, scarce. Therefore, we studied the association between heat exposure during sauna bathing (i.e., the frequency of sauna bathing, frequency of heat sessions, length of stay in heat, sauna temperature) and the subsequent risk of dementia. A prospective cohort study was conducted based on 13,994 men and women aged 30-69 and free from dementia diagnosis from the Finnish Mobile Clinic Follow-up Survey. During a follow-up of 39 years, a total of 1805 dementia patients were diagnosed. The sauna bathing data was gathered from a questionnaire. Analyses based on the Cox model included the sauna bathing variables and the potential confounding factors. Sauna bathing frequency was related to a reduced risk of dementia after adjustment for the potential sociodemographic, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors of dementia considered. The hazard ratio of dementia between individuals sauna bathing 9-12 times per month in comparison with those not sauna bathing or sauna bathing less than four times per month was 0.47 (95% CI = 0.25-0.88) during the first 20 years of follow-up and 0.81 (95% CI = 0.69-0.97) during the whole follow-up. The results are in line with the hypothesis that sauna bathing provides protection against dementia. Further studies are required to verify the suggested benefits of sauna bathing.","['Cohort study', 'Dementia', 'Passive body heating', 'Protection', 'Sauna']",Preventive medicine reports,2020-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Knekt', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Järvinen', 'firstname': 'Ritva', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'University of Eastern, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rissanen', 'firstname': 'Harri', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Heliövaara', 'firstname': 'Markku', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Aromaa', 'firstname': 'Arpo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.'}]",,,,© 2020 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101221

475,33079274,Risk factors for subsequent hip fractures and fatality after an initial hip fracture in Korea: using nationwide claims data.,"In this study, the risk of fatality after hip fracture but not the risk of subsequent hip fractures was higher among men.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk factors for subsequent hip fractures and fatality after an initial hip fracture among Koreans older than 50 years of age using information in the national claims database.
Our study was conducted using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database from 2007 to 2016. A total of 16,915 Korean patients aged ≥ 50 years with a first hip fracture in 2012 were followed for 4 years. Data on fracture, comorbidity, and prescription variables were retrieved from the national registry. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify the risk factors affecting subsequent hip fractures and fatality after the initial hip fracture.
A total of 952 patients had subsequent hip fractures, and 6793 patients died. The cumulative incidence rates were 1.3% after 1 year and 5.6% after 4 years. Old age, renal disease, dementia, and Parkinson's disease were associated with a higher risk of subsequent hip fractures. The fatality rate after the initial hip fracture was 1.6 times higher among men than among women. Certain risk factors for fatality, such as pneumonia after fracture, cerebrovascular disease, mild liver disease, renal disease, and malignancy, were more prevalent among men.
During the study period, the risk of fatality after hip fracture but not the risk of subsequent hip fractures was higher among men. The gender difference in fatality might be explained by the larger burden of comorbid diseases among men.","['Fatality', 'Gender', 'Incidence', 'Nationwide claims data', 'Subsequent hip fracture']",Archives of osteoporosis,2020-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Yoo', 'firstname': 'Jun-Il', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Jinju, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ha-Young', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal medicine, Gangneung Asan Hospital, College of Medicine, University of Ulsan, Gangneung, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jang', 'firstname': 'Sunmee', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gachon University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Young-Kyun', 'initials': 'YK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ha', 'firstname': 'Yong-Chan', 'initials': 'YC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, 102 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-ku, Seoul, 156-755, Republic of Korea. hayongch@naver.com.'}]",,"During the study period, the risk of fatality after hip fracture but not the risk of subsequent hip fractures was higher among men.

476,33075651,The long-term consequences of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms on later life cognitive function and dementia risk.,"Stress may be a risk factor for dementia, however it is unknown whether post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are associated with incident dementia in community-dwelling older individuals. The aim was to determine whether lifetime major trauma with and without re-experiencing of PTSD symptoms is associated with later-life cognition and dementia risk. Participants were 1,700 community-dwelling older adults (65+) in the longitudinal ESPRIT study followed over 14 years. Lifetime major traumatic exposure and PTSD were assessed using Watson's PTSD Inventory. Cognitive tests assessed global cognition, visual memory, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed and executive function. Incident dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Lifetime major trauma (versus no trauma) was associated with significantly increased executive function and increased global function in men, however women with lifetime trauma and re-experiencing symptoms had a significantly increased risk of low global cognition. Over 14 years, lifetime trauma without re-experiencing symptoms was associated with a significantly decreased risk of incident dementia, particularly for women. Lifetime major trauma without re-experiencing symptoms (but not with) may be protective for later life cognitive function. However, the mechanisms and moderating factors underlying these association requires further investigation.","['PTSD', 'cognition', 'dementia', 'stress', 'trauma']",Psychiatry research,2020-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Nilaweera', 'firstname': 'Dinuli', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Freak-Poli', 'firstname': 'Rosanne', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ritchie', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'PSNREC, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaudieu', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'PSNREC, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ancelin', 'firstname': 'Marie-Laure', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'PSNREC, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; PSNREC, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.

477,33068660,"Metformin use in elderly population with diabetes reduced the risk of dementia in a dose-dependent manner, based on the Korean NHIS-HEALS cohort.","The aim of this study is to investigate the association between metformin usage and dementia in an elderly Korean population.
Participants were divided into five groups: metformin non-users with diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin users with DM (low-, mid-, and high-users), and non-diabetic Individuals. Dementia was defined with primary diagnostic dementia codes according to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. To compare the incidence rate of dementia among the five groups, Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank test were employed. Also, to control the confounding factors, Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted in a sequential adjustment.
The median follow-up was 12.4 years. The overall incidence rate of dementia was 11.3% (8.4% in men and 13.9% in women). Compared with metformin non-users, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of low-, mid-, and high-users and non-diabetic individuals for dementia were 0.97 (0.73-1.28), 0.77 (0.58-1.01), 0.48 (0.35-0.67), and 0.98 (0.84-1.15), respectively, in men, respectively, and 0.90 (0.65-0.98), 0.61 (0.50-0.76), 0.46 (0.36-0.58), and 0.92 (0.81-1.04), respectively, in women, after full adjustment of confounding variables.

32900766",Sex differences in clinical phenotype and transitions of care among individuals dying of COVID-19 in Italy.,"Among the unknowns posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the role of biological sex to explain disease susceptibility and progression is still a matter of debate, with limited sex-disaggregated data available.
A retrospective analysis was performed to assess if sex differences exist in the clinical manifestations and transitions of care among hospitalized individuals dying with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (February 27-June 11, 2020). Clinical characteristics and the times from symptoms' onset to admission, nasopharyngeal swab, and death were compared between sexes. Adjusted multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinical features associated with male sex.
Of the 32,938 COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in Italy, 3517 hospitalized and deceased individuals with COVID-19 (mean 78 ± 12 years, 33% women) were analyzed. At admission, men had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (adj-OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adj-OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.29-2.27), and chronic kidney disease (adj-OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.96), while women were older and more likely to have dementia (adj-OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.95) and autoimmune diseases (adj-OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), yet both sexes had a high level of multimorbidity. The times from symptoms' onset to admission and nasopharyngeal swab were slightly longer in men despite a typical acute respiratory illness with more frequent fever at the onset. Men received more often experimental therapy (adj-OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.45-5.74) and experienced more likely acute kidney injury (adj-OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.90).
Men and women dying with COVID-19 had different clinical manifestations and transitions of care.

30339108",Depression as a risk factor for dementia in older people with type 2 diabetes and the mediating effect of inflammation.,"We aimed to determine the association of depression with dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes, and to explore the possible mediating role of inflammation in this relationship.
The Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study is a prospective cohort of 1066 men and women with type 2 diabetes aged 60-75 years. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to investigate the association between depression, assessed at baseline, and subsequent risk of dementia over 10 years. Depression was defined using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, while incident dementia was defined using medical records, prescription data and death certificates. The potential mediating effect of systemic inflammation was assessed by adjusting models for a generalised inflammation factor, derived from four inflammatory markers measured at baseline (C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNF-α and fibrinogen), and carrying out an exploratory mediation analysis.
Dementia developed in 105 participants over a median follow-up of 10.6 years. After adjusting for age and sex, depression was associated with over a 2.5-fold increase in risk of dementia (HR 2.59 [95% CI 1.62, 4.15]). Additional adjustment for the generalised inflammation factor and other covariates did not attenuate the size of association between depression and incident dementia and mediation analysis showed that it was not a mediator. Adjusted logistic regression models showed cross-sectional associations of C-reactive protein and IL-6 with depression.
Depression is an important risk factor for dementia in people with type 2 diabetes.

480,33053557,Characteristics of Individuals Who Converted to Dementia during a 5-Year Follow-Up.,"Early diagnosis of dementia is important; however, the diagnostic criteria for the preclinical stage of dementia, including biomarkers and pathophysiological markers, are not suitable for application in patients in real-world clinical settings. One potential noninvasive method to predict the risk of dementia conversion is the neuropsychological test. Therefore, in this study, we examined the results of various assessments, such as comprehensive neuropsychological tests, and the daily function of participants who were evaluated periodically for 5 years.
All participants were outpatients or inpatients with subjective cognitive complaints, who visited a local university hospital for neuropsychiatric evaluation, between January 2011 and January 2019. Of a total of 1,652 subjects who underwent initial screening during this period, 107 were nondemented individuals. These participants underwent periodic comprehensive cognitive tests for up to 5 years. Survival and factors affecting dementia conversion were analyzed using the time-dependent Cox regression analysis. Assessment items included demographic information, including age, sex, and education; 5 cognitive domains of a comprehensive neuropsychological test including memory, language, attention, visuospatial functions, and frontal (executive) function; Barthel's activities of daily living; the mini-mental state examination findings; and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores.
This study included 61 participants (21 women and 40 men) who developed dementia during the study period. Verification of the cognitive variables affecting dementia conversion revealed that better memory was associated with a lower risk of conversion (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.614, p = 0.005) and higher attention was associated with a higher risk of conversion (HR = 1.602, p = 0.023). In the analysis of the subscales of the CDR, a higher community affairs score (i.e., less social activities) was associated with a higher risk of conversion (HR = 10.814, p = 0.028).
Individuals with prominent memory decline or problems with social activities should be carefully observed for dementia conversion. Cognitive intervention techniques for cognitive stimulation, such as social and leisure activities, as well as cognitive training need to be actively used for patients in whom dementia is a concern.","['Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Neuropsychology']",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,2020-10-15,"[{'lastname': 'Yun', 'firstname': 'Seok-Ho', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jo', 'firstname': 'So-Hye', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Hyun-Seok', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Koo', 'firstname': 'Bon-Hoon', 'initials': 'BH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Hye-Geum', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea, psykhg@yu.ac.kr.'}]",,"Individuals with prominent memory decline or problems with social activities should be carefully observed for dementia conversion.

30288767",Incident Dementia in Elderly Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Germany.,"Dementia and NAFLD are two frequent conditions that share underlying risk factors mainly in the realm of metabolic disease. Additionally, an association between NAFLD and brain aging has been proposed. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis if NAFLD is an independent risk factor for emerging dementia. In this population-based cohort study, elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with NAFLD diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 were matched 1:1 to a cohort without NAFLD based on ICD-10 coding in the Disease Analyzer database. Matching criteria were age, sex, physician, index year, and co-diagnoses associated with dementia. The primary outcomes of this study were all-cause dementia diagnoses, the incidence of vascular dementia, and antidementive drug prescription. A total of 22,317 patients with NAFLD were matched to 22,317 patients without NAFLD. Within 10 years of the index date, 16.0% of patients with NAFLD and 15.6% of the patients without NAFLD were diagnosed with dementia. On Cox regression analysis, there is no association between NAFLD and the incidence of all-cause dementia (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.04), vascular dementia (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78-1.02), or the new prescription of antidementive therapy (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-1.01). In sensitivity analyses, there was no association between NAFLD and dementia in different age-groups as well as men or women. In conclusion, in this database study of elderly patients coded with NAFLD no independent association with incident dementia was detected. Risk assessment regarding dementia in patients with NAFLD should be carried out in the same way as for metabolic burdened patients.","['Aging', 'Cognitive decline', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Database research study', 'Metabolic inflammation']",Digestive diseases and sciences,2020-10-11,"[{'lastname': 'Labenz', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.\nCirrhosis Center Mainz (CCM), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.\nMetabolic Liver Research Program, Department of Medicine I, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131, Mainz, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kostev', 'firstname': 'Karel', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology, IQVIA, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaps', 'firstname': 'Leonard', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.\nMetabolic Liver Research Program, Department of Medicine I, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131, Mainz, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Galle', 'firstname': 'Peter R', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.\nCirrhosis Center Mainz (CCM), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schattenberg', 'firstname': 'Jörn M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany. joern.schattenberg@unimedizin-mainz.de.\nCirrhosis Center Mainz (CCM), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany. joern.schattenberg@unimedizin-mainz.de.\nMetabolic Liver Research Program, Department of Medicine I, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131, Mainz, Germany. joern.schattenberg@unimedizin-mainz.de.'}]",,,,© 2020.

28867810",Gender-Based Analysis of Risk Factors for Dementia Using Senior Cohort.,"Globally, one of the biggest problems with the increase in the elderly population is dementia. However, dementia still has no fundamental cure. Therefore, it is important to predict and prevent dementia early. For early prediction of dementia, it is crucial to find dementia risk factors that increase a person's risk of developing dementia. In this paper, the subject of dementia risk factor analysis and discovery studies were limited to gender, because it is assumed that the difference in the prevalence of dementia in men and women will lead to differences in the risk factors for dementia among men and women. This study analyzed the Korean National Health Information System-Senior Cohort using machine-learning techniques. By using the machine-learning technique, it was possible to reveal a very small causal relationship between data that are ignored using existing statistical techniques. By using the senior cohort, it was possible to analyze 6000 data that matched the experimental conditions out of 558,147 sample subjects over 14 years. In order to analyze the difference in dementia risk factors between men and women, three machine-learning-based dementia risk factor analysis models were constructed and compared. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the risk factors for dementia in men and women are different. In addition, not only did the results include most of the known dementia risk factors, previously unknown candidates for dementia risk factors were also identified. We hope that our research will be helpful in finding new dementia risk factors.","['deep learning', 'dementia', 'dementia risk factor', 'machine learning', 'senior cohort']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-10-09,"[{'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Jaekue', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Convergence Research Center for Diagnosis, Treatment and Care System of Dementia, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul 02792, Korea.\nFuture Information Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Seoul 02456, Korea.\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02855, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwon', 'firstname': 'Lee-Nam', 'initials': 'LN', 'affiliation': 'Convergence Research Center for Diagnosis, Treatment and Care System of Dementia, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul 02792, Korea.\nFuture Information Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Seoul 02456, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Heuiseok', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02855, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Chun', 'firstname': 'Hong-Woo', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': 'Convergence Research Center for Diagnosis, Treatment and Care System of Dementia, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul 02792, Korea.\nFuture Information Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Seoul 02456, Korea.'}]",,,,,"10.3390/ijerph17197274

28497805",A data-driven prospective study of dementia among older adults in the United States.,"Studies examining risk factors for dementia have typically focused on testing a priori hypotheses within specific risk factor domains, leaving unanswered the question of what risk factors across broad and diverse research fields may be most important to predicting dementia. We examined the relative importance of 65 sociodemographic, early-life, economic, health and behavioral, social, and genetic risk factors across the life course in predicting incident dementia and how these rankings may vary across racial/ethnic (non-Hispanic white and black) and gender (men and women) groups.
We conducted a prospective analysis of dementia and its association with 65 risk factors in a sample of 7,908 adults aged 51 years and older from the nationally representative US-based Health and Retirement Study. We used traditional survival analysis methods (Fine and Gray models) and a data-driven approach (random survival forests for competing risks) which allowed us to account for the semi-competing risk of death with up to 14 years of follow-up. Overall, the top five predictors across all groups were lower education, loneliness, lower wealth and income, and lower self-reported health. However, we observed variation in the leading predictors of dementia across racial/ethnic and gender groups such that at most four risk factors were consistently observed in the top ten predictors across the four demographic strata (non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic white women, non-Hispanic black men, non-Hispanic black women).
We identified leading risk factors across racial/ethnic and gender groups that predict incident dementia over a 14-year period among a nationally representative sample of US aged 51 years and older. Our ranked lists may be useful for guiding future observational and quasi-experimental research that investigates understudied domains of risk and emphasizes life course economic and health conditions as well as disparities therein.",[],PloS one,2020-10-08,"[{'lastname': 'Weiss', 'firstname': 'Jordan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Population Studies Center and the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Puterman', 'firstname': 'Eli', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Kinesiology, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Prather', 'firstname': 'Aric A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Ware', 'firstname': 'Erin B', 'initials': 'EB', 'affiliation': 'Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehkopf', 'firstname': 'David H', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, United States of America.'}]",,,,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0239994

18459271",Sex differences in the management of persons with dementia following a subnational primary care policy intervention.,"The influence of sex and gender on the risk of dementia, its clinical presentation and progression is increasingly being recognized. However, current dementia strategies have not explicitly considered sex and gender differences in the management of dementia to ensure equitable care. The objective of this study was to examine the moderating effect of sex on the quality of care following the implementation of the Quebec Alzheimer Plan (QAP).
We conducted a secondary analysis of the evaluation of the QAP consisting of a retrospective chart review of 945 independent, randomly-selected patient charts of males and females 75+ years old with dementia and a visit to one of 13 participating Family Medicine Groups before (October 2011-July 2013) and after (October 2014 - July 2015). The quality of dementia care score, based on Canadian and international recommendations and consensus guidelines, consisted of documented assessments in 10 domains. We used a mixed linear regression model to measure the interaction between sex and the implementation of the QAP on the quality of dementia care score, adjusting for age and number of medications.
We found that improvements in the quality of dementia care following the QAP were larger for men than women (mean difference = 4.97; 95%CI: 0.08, 9.85). We found that men had a larger improvement in four indicators (driving assessments, dementia medication management, Alzheimer Society referrals, and functional status evaluation), while women had a smaller improvement in three (home care needs, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and weight). Men were prescribed fewer anticholinergics post-QAP, while women were prescribed more. Cognitive testing improved in men but decreased for women following the QAP; the opposite was observed for caregiver needs.
While the overall quality of care improved after the implementation of the QAP, this study reveals differences in dementia management between men and women. While we identified areas of inequalities in the care received, it is unclear whether this represents inequities in access to care and health outcomes. Future research should focus on better understanding sex and gender-specific needs in dementia to bridge this gap and better inform dementia strategies.","['Equity', 'Evaluation', 'Gender', 'Health policy', 'Sex']",International journal for equity in health,2020-10-08,"[{'lastname': 'Sourial', 'firstname': 'Nadia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Département de Médecine de Famille et de Médecine d'Urgence, Faculté de médecine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Canada. nadia.sourial@umontreal.ca.\nCentre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Canada. nadia.sourial@umontreal.ca.""}, {'lastname': 'Arsenault-Lapierre', 'firstname': 'Geneviève', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Margo-Dermer', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Henein', 'firstname': 'Mary', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Vedel', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.\nDepartment of Family Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.'}]",,"While the overall quality of care improved after the implementation of the QAP, this study reveals differences in dementia management between men and women.

30181149",Impact of cardiovascular risk factors and genetics on 10-year absolute risk of dementia: risk charts for targeted prevention.,"Dementia is a major global challenge for health and social care in aging populations. A third of all dementia may be preventable due to cardiovascular risk factors. Intensive multi-domain intervention trials targeting primarily cardiovascular risk factors show improved cognitive function in people at risk. Such interventions will, however, be expensive to implement in all individuals at risk and will represent unrealistic economic tasks for most societies. Therefore, a risk score identifying high-risk individuals is warranted.
In 61 664 individuals from two prospective cohorts of the Danish general population, we generated 10-year absolute risk scores for all-cause dementia from cardiovascular risk factors and genetics. In both sexes, 10-year absolute risk of all-cause dementia increased with increasing age, number of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 alleles, number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk alleles, and cardiovascular risk factors. The highest 10-year absolute risks of all-cause dementia seen in smoking women with diabetes, low education, APOE ɛ44 genotype, and 22-31 GWAS risk alleles were 6%, 23%, 48%, and 66% in those aged 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80-100, respectively. Corresponding values for men were 5%, 19%, 42%, and 60%, respectively.
Ten-year absolute risk of all-cause dementia increased with age, APOE ɛ4 alleles, GWAS risk alleles, diabetes, low education, and smoking in both women and men. Ten-year absolute risk charts for dementia will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, those who likely will benefit the most from an early intervention against cardiovascular risk factors.","['Cardiovascular risk factors', 'Dementia', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetics']",European heart journal,2020-10-07,"[{'lastname': 'Juul Rasmussen', 'firstname': 'Ida', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 1, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Rasmussen', 'firstname': 'Katrine Laura', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 1, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Nordestgaard', 'firstname': 'Børge G', 'initials': 'BG', 'affiliation': 'The Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 1, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Biochemistry, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 1, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen City Heart Study, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Nordre Fasanvej 57, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Tybjærg-Hansen', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 1, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen City Heart Study, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Nordre Fasanvej 57, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Frikke-Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 1, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]",,"Ten-year absolute risk of all-cause dementia increased with age, APOE ɛ4 alleles, GWAS risk alleles, diabetes, low education, and smoking in both women and men.

486,33016917,Incidence of Dementia and Associated Factors in the EPIC-Spain Dementia Cohort.,"Dementia has become a public health priority as the number of cases continues to grow worldwide.
To assess dementia incidence and determinants in the EPIC-Spain Dementia Cohort.
25,015 participants (57% women) were recruited from three Spanish regions between 1992-1996 and followed-up for over 20 years. Incident cases were ascertained through individual revision of medical records of potential cases. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates (IR) of dementia and sub-types (Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD) were calculated by sex. Neelson-Aalen cumulative incidence estimates at 10, 15, and 20 years were obtained for each sex and age group. Multivariate Royston-Parmar models were used to assess independent determinants.
Global IR were higher in women for dementia and AD, and similar by sex for non-AD. IR ranged from 0.09 cases of dementia (95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.13) and 0.05 (0.03-0.09) of AD per 1000 person-years (py) in participants below 60 years, to 23.2 (15.9-33.8) cases of dementia and 14.6 (9.1-33.5) of AD (per 1000 py) in those ≥85 years. Adjusted IR were consistently higher in women than men for overall dementia and AD. Up to 12.5% of women and 9.1% of men 60-65 years-old developed dementia within 20 years. Low education, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were the main independent predictors of dementia risk, whereas alcohol showed an inverse association.
Dementia incidence increased with age and was higher among women, but showed no geographical pattern. Dementia risk was higher among subjects with lower education, not drinking alcohol, and presenting cardiovascular risk factors.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'EPIC-Spain', 'cohort study', 'dementia', 'epidemiology', 'incidence', 'risk factors\n']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-10-06,"[{'lastname': 'Andreu-Reinón', 'firstname': 'María Encarnación', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Section of Neurology, Department of Internal Medicine, Rafael Méndez Hospital, Murcia Health Service, Lorca, Murcia, Spain.\nMurcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Huerta', 'firstname': 'José María', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Murcia Regional Health Council, Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gavrila', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Amiano', 'firstname': 'Pilar', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'CIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.\nPublic Health Division of Gipuzkoa, Basque Government, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain.\nBiodonostia Health Research Institute, San Sebastián, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mar', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Biodonostia Health Research Institute, San Sebastián, Spain.\nClinical Management Unit, OSI Alto Deba, Arrasate-Mondragón, Spain.\nAP-OSIs Gipuzkoa Research Unit, OSI Alto Deba, Arrasate-Mondragón, Spain.\nHealth Services Research Network on Chronic Patients (REDISSEC), Bilbao, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Tainta', 'firstname': 'Mikel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'CITA Alzheimer Foundation, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain.\nNeurology Service, OSI Goierri-Alto Urola, Zumárraga, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ardanaz', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'CIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.\nPublic Health Institute of Navarra, IdiSNA, Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Larumbe', 'firstname': 'Rosa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Public Health Institute of Navarra, IdiSNA, Pamplona, Spain.\nNeuroepigenetics Laboratory, Navarrabiomed, Public University of Navarre (UPNA), Pamplona, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurology, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Navarro', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.\nDepartment of Health and Social Sciences, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Colorado-Yohar', 'firstname': 'Sandra M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Murcia Regional Health Council, Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.\nResearch Group on Demography and Health, National Faculty of Public Health, University of Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Navarro-Mateu', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.\nCIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.\nUnidad de Docencia, Investigación y Formación en Salud Mental (UDIF-SM).

11089981","Association of Cigarette Smoking With Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration, Neuroinflammation, and Oxidation.","Cigarette smoking has been associated with risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease. The association between smoking and biomarkers of changes in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is not fully understood.
To investigate the association of cigarette smoking with CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, oxidation, and neuroprotection.
In this case-control study of 191 adult men in China, biomarkers in the CSF of participants with and without significant cigarette exposure were examined. Participants who did not smoke and had no history of substance use disorder or dependence were assigned to the nonsmoking group. The active smoking group included participants who consumed at least 10 cigarettes per day for 1 year. Five-milliliter samples of CSF were obtained from routine lumbar puncture conducted before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery. Data collection took place from September 2014 to January 2016, and analysis took place from January to February 2016.
Cigarette smoking.
CSF levels of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42), which has diagnostic specificity for Alzheimer disease, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), total superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were measured. Sociodemographic data and history of smoking were obtained.
Of 191 participants, 87 (45.5%) were included in the active smoking group and 104 (54.4%) in the nonsmoking group. Compared with the active smoking group, the nonsmoking group was younger (mean [SD] age, 34.4 [10.5] years vs 29.6 [9.5] years; P = .01), had more education (mean [SD] duration of education, 11.9 [3.1] years vs 13.2 [2.6] years; P = .001), and had lower body mass index (mean [SD], 25.9 [3.6] vs 24.9 [4.0]; P = .005). Comparing the nonsmoking group with the smoking group, mean (SD) CSF levels of Aβ42 (38.0 [25.9] pg/mL vs 52.8 [16.5] pg/mL; P < .001) and TNFα (23.0 [2.5] pg/mL vs 28.0 [2.0] pg/mL; P < .001) were significantly lower, while BDNF (23.1 [3.9] pg/mL vs 13.8 [2.7] pg/mL; P < .001), total SOD (15.7 [2.6] U/L vs 13.9 [2.4] U/L; P < .001), total NOS (28.3 [7.2] U/L vs 14.7 [5.6] U/L; P < .001), inducible NOS (16.0 [5.4] U/L vs 10.3 [2.7] U/L; P < .001), and constitutive NOS (12.4 [6.9] U/mL vs 4.4 [3.9] U/mL) were higher. In addition, in participants in the smoking group who were aged 40 years or older, total SOD levels were negatively correlated with Aβ42 levels (r = -0.57; P = .02). In those who smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day, TNFα levels were positively correlated with Aβ42 levels (r = 0.51; P = .006). The association of TNFα with Aβ42 production was stronger than that of total SOD with Aβ42 production (z = -4.38; P < .001).
This case-control study found that cigarette smoking was associated with at-risk biomarkers for Alzheimer disease, as indicated by higher Aβ42 levels, excessive oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and impaired neuroprotection found in the CSF of participants in the active smoking group.",[],JAMA network open,2020-10-03,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yanlong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Mental Health, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.\nThe Affiliated Kangning Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.\nCollege of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China.\nXinjiang Key Laboratory of Neurological Disorder Research, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.\nPsychosomatic Medicine Research Division, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Huhhot, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychology, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Xue', 'firstname': 'Qing', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Yimin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Psychosomatic Medicine Research Division, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Huhhot, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Mengjie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Psychosomatic Medicine Research Division, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Huhhot, China.\nSleep Medicine Center, Peking University International Hospital, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Jinzhong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Affiliated Wenling Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenling, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Guohua', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Neurological Disorder Research, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Cunbao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Psychosomatic Medicine Research Division, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Huhhot, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Hui-Chih', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health and Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Mind-Body Interface Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.\nCollege of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'Kuan-Pin', 'initials': 'KP', 'affiliation': 'School of Mental Health, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Mind-Body Interface Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.\nCollege of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.\nAn-Nan Hospital, China Medical University, Tainan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Fan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Neurological Disorder Research, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.\nPsychosomatic Medicine Research Division, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Huhhot, China.\nBeijing Hui-Long-Guan Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.'}]",,,"Of 191 participants, 87 (45.5%) were included in the active smoking group and 104 (54.4%) in the nonsmoking group.

The association of TNFα with Aβ42 production was stronger than that of total SOD with Aβ42 production (z = -4.38; P < .001).",,"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18777

488,32991015,Risk of dementia in patients with periodontitis and related protective factors: A nationwide retrospective cohort study.,"We aimed to evaluate the long-term risk of dementia in patients with periodontitis and its associated factors.
Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database, we identified 56,018 patients aged ≥50 years with newly diagnosed periodontitis in 2000-2008. A cohort of 56,018 adults without periodontitis was selected for comparison, with matching by age and sex. Both cohorts were followed from 2000 to the end of 2013, and incident dementia was identified during the follow-up period. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of dementia associated with periodontitis were calculated in the multivariate regressions.
Periodontitis was associated with dementia risk (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.67-1.93), and the association between periodontitis and dementia risk was significant in men, women, and people aged more than 60 years. Among patients with periodontitis, the use of statins (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.71-0.87), metformin (HR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44-0.62), and influenza vaccination (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.61-0.74) were associated with a reduced risk of dementia, while diabetes, mental disorders, and stroke were major significant risk factors.
Periodontitis was a risk factor for dementia, while the use of statins and metformin may reduce the risk of dementia.","['dementia', 'influenza vaccination', 'metformin', 'periodontitis', 'statins']",Journal of clinical periodontology,2020-09-30,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Chia-Yen', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dentistry, Taiwan Adventist Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nSchool of Dentistry, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Chuen-Chau', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nAnesthesiology and Health Policy Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Chao-Shun', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nAnesthesiology and Health Policy Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yeh', 'firstname': 'Chun-Chieh', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Surgery, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Chaur-Jong', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Ching-Zong', 'initials': 'CZ', 'affiliation': 'School of Dentistry, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Dentistry, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Ta-Liang', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Anesthesiology and Health Policy Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Liao', 'firstname': 'Chien-Chang', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nAnesthesiology and Health Policy Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.\nResearch Center of Big Data and Meta-Analysis, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.\nSchool of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}]",,,"Periodontitis was associated with dementia risk (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.67-1.93), and the association between periodontitis and dementia risk was significant in men, women, and people aged more than 60 years.

30352589",Diabetes as a risk factor for incident peripheral arterial disease in women compared to men: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Previous meta-analyses have suggested that diabetes confers a greater excess risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, vascular dementia, and heart failure in women compared to men. While the underlying mechanism that explains such greater excess risk is unknown, in the current meta-analysis we hypothesized that we would find a similar sex difference in the relationship between diabetes and peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
PubMed MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase were systematically searched for prospective population-based cohort studies, with no restriction on publication date, language, or country. We included studies that reported the relative risk (RR), and its variability, for incident PAD associated with diabetes in both sexes. We excluded studies that did not adjust at least for age, and in which participants had pre-existing PAD. In cases where sex-specific results were not reported, study authors were contacted. Random-effects meta-analyses with inverse variance weighting were used to obtain summary sex-specific RRs and the women: men ratio of RRs for PAD. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess study quality.
Data from seven cohorts, totalling 2071,260 participants (49.8% women), were included. The relative risk for incident PAD associated with diabetes compared with no diabetes was 1.96 (95% CI 1.29-2.63) in women and 1.84 (95% CI 1.29-2.86) in men, after adjusting for potential confounders. The multiple-adjusted RR ratio was 1.05 (95% CI 0.90-1.22), with virtually no heterogeneity between studies (I
Consistent with other studies, we found evidence that diabetes is an independent risk factor for PAD. However, in contrast to similar studies of other types of cardiovascular disease, we did not find evidence that diabetes confers a greater excess risk in women compared to men for PAD. More research is needed to explain this sex differential between PAD and other forms of CVD, in the sequelae of diabetes. In addition, we found that very few studies reported the sex-specific relative risk for the association between diabetes and PAD, adding to existing evidence for the need for improved reporting of sex-disaggregated results in cardiovascular disease research.","['Cardiovascular disease', 'Diabetes', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Peripheral vascular disease', 'Sex difference']",Cardiovascular diabetology,2020-09-28,"[{'lastname': 'Chase-Vilchez', 'firstname': 'Alyssa Z', 'initials': 'AZ', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Isaac H Y', 'initials': 'IHY', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Peters', 'firstname': 'Sanne A E', 'initials': 'SAE', 'affiliation': 'Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Missenden Road, PO Box M201, Sydney, NSW, 2050, Australia.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodward', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Missenden Road, PO Box M201, Sydney, NSW, 2050, Australia. markw@georgeinstitute.org.au.\nThe George Institute for Global Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College, London, UK. markw@georgeinstitute.org.au.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. markw@georgeinstitute.org.au.'}]",,,"Data from seven cohorts, totalling 2071,260 participants (49.8% women), were included.

17353383",Changes in Body Mass Index Are Related to Faster Cognitive Decline Among African American Older Adults.,"The purpose of this study was to: (1) examine relationships between body mass index (BMI) stability and cognitive decline in older African Americans; and (2) investigate differences in the relationships between women and men.
The present study is a secondary data analysis of the Minority Aging Research Study, which is a longitudinal, cohort study of risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease among older African Americans living in the Chicago, IL, area. The study entails annual clinical evaluations, including measures of 19 neuropsychological tests that represent five cognitive domains, including episodic, semantic, and working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability.
Participants (n = 671; mean age = 73.5 years; standard deviation = 6.2 years) were included in the present analysis if they were dementia free at baseline and completed at least two clinical evaluations, on average 1 year apart, that included valid cognitive and BMI assessments.
Mixed-effects models showed higher baseline BMI was related to slower global cognitive decline, whereas changes in BMI (instability) were related to faster global cognitive decline. These effects were the same for four of five cognitive domains and remained after controlling for various health characteristics. However, women and men did not differ in any of the relationships.
Higher BMI is related to slower cognitive decline in older African Americans, but greater BMI instability is related to faster decline. Stability of BMI should be considered in the cognitive aging of African Americans.","['Blacks/African Americans', 'body mass index', 'cognition', 'obesity']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2020-09-27,"[{'lastname': 'Aiken-Morgan', 'firstname': 'Adrienne T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, North Carolina.\nCenter on Health and Society, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Capuano', 'firstname': 'Ana W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nRush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'Arvanitakis', 'firstname': 'Zoe', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nRush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'Lisa L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.\nRush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.""}]",,"Higher BMI is related to slower cognitive decline in older African Americans, but greater BMI instability is related to faster decline.

Single-center observational study.
Patients admitted to geriatric care in a large hospital in Sweden between March 1 and June 11, 2020; 250 were treated for COVID-19 and 717 for other diagnoses.
COVID-19 diagnosis was clinically confirmed by positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test or, if negative, by other methods. Patient data were extracted from electronic medical records, which included Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and were further used for assessments of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). In-hospital mortality and home discharge were followed up for up to 25 and 28 days, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex were used.
Among the patients with COVID-19, in-hospital mortality rate was 24% and home discharge rate was 44%. Higher age was associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05 per each year, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01‒1.08) and lower probability of home discharge (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95‒0.99). CFS (>5) and CCI, but not HFRS, were predictive of in-hospital mortality (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02‒3.65 and HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02‒1.58, respectively). Patients with CFS >5 had a lower probability of being discharged home (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25‒0.58). CCI and HFRS were not associated with home discharge. In general, effects were more pronounced in men. Acute kidney injury was associated with in-hospital mortality and hypertension with discharge to home. Other comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, chronic kidney disease and dementia) were not associated with either outcome.

25784512",Higher visit-to-visit total cholesterol variability is associated with lower cognitive function among middle-aged and elderly Chinese men.,"To examine the prospective associations between total cholesterol (TC) variability and cognitive function in a large sample of Chinese participants aged 45 years and above. A total of 6,377 people who participated in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were included. TC variability was defined as the intra-individual standard deviation over two blood tests in CHARLS 2011 and 2015 (Wave 1 and Wave 3). Cognitive function was assessed by a global cognition score, which included three tests: episodic memory, figure drawing and Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS). Multivariate linear regression models (MRLMs) and generalized estimating equation (GEE) were used to investigate associations between TC variability and cognitive scores. After adjusting for potential confounders, male participants with higher visit-to-visit TC variability showed lower global cognition scores (β = - 0.71, P < 0.001). After further adjustment for baseline cognition, the association remained statistically significant (β = - 0.68, P < 0.001). The domains with declines were focused on episodic memory (β = - 0.22, P = 0.026) and TICS (β = - 0.44, P = 0.004). However, these associations were not found in women (β = - 0.10, P = 0.623). For men, the rates of decline in global cognition increased by 0.14 (β = - 0.14, P = 0.009) units per year while TC variability increased by 1 mmol/L. For males, higher visit-to-visit TC variability correlated with lower cognitive function and an increased rate of decreases in memory. More attention should be paid to cognitive decline in males with high TC variability, and particularly, on decreases in memory, calculation, attention and orientation.",[],Scientific reports,2020-09-25,"[{'lastname': 'Hua', 'firstname': 'Jianian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.\nMedical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Qiao', 'firstname': 'Yanan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Heath, Medical College of Soochow University, 199 Renai Road, Suzhou, 215123, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Ke', 'firstname': 'Chaofu', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Heath, Medical College of Soochow University, 199 Renai Road, Suzhou, 215123, People's Republic of China. cfke@suda.edu.cn.""}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Yueping', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Heath, Medical College of Soochow University, 199 Renai Road, Suzhou, 215123, People's Republic of China. shenyueping@suda.edu.cn.""}]",,,,,"10.1038/s41598-020-72601-7

28759663",Does Gender Influence the Relationship Between High Blood Pressure and Dementia? Highlighting Areas for Further Investigation.,"Gender differences have been noted in studies linking blood pressure to all-cause dementia, and the two most common forms of dementia: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). However, how gender modifies the relationship between blood pressure and dementia remains unclear.
To review evidence for a gender modifying effect on the link between blood pressure and all-cause dementia.
A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Sixteen out of 256 reviewed articles met inclusion criteria.
For women, higher midlife systolic blood pressure (SBP) and hypertension were both associated with greater risk of all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD, in six out of seven studies. Two of these studies reported higher midlife SBP/hypertension were associated with greater risk for all-cause dementia in women, but not men. One study reported higher midlife SBP associated with greater AD risk in women, but not men. However, another study reported that midlife hypertension associated with AD risk in men, but not women. No clear gender differences were reported in the relationship between late-life high blood pressure/hypertension with all-cause dementia or AD.
Studies rarely, and inconsistently, analyzed or reported gender effects. Therefore, interpretation of available evidence regarding the role of gender in blood pressure associated dementia was difficult. Several studies indicated higher midlife SBP was associated with greater risk of all-cause dementia for women, compared to men. Future studies should evaluate women-specific aging processes that occur in midlife when considering the association between blood pressure and dementia risk.","['Aging', 'Alzheimer type', 'blood pressure', 'dementia', 'female', 'gender', 'hypertension', 'neurobiology', 'sex', 'systematic review', 'vascular']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Blanken', 'firstname': 'Anna E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nation', 'firstname': 'Daniel A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.\nInstitute for Memory Disorders and Neurological Impairments, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.'}]",,"Studies rarely, and inconsistently, analyzed or reported gender effects.

494,32947477,Influence of cardiovascular risk factors on arterial hypertension and mild cognitive impairment in 4602 participants of the ELITE study.,"In ELITE (Ernährung, Lebensstil und individuelle Information zur Verhinderung von Herzinfarkt, Schlaganfall und Demenz; german for: Nutrition, Lifestyle and Individual Information for the Prevention of Heart Attack, Stroke and Dementia) data on cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive function and quality of life are prospectively collected, which will be improved through targeted individual information. The aim is to improve the health of the participants and identify the reasons for the lack of implementation.
Risk factors of 4602 participants were linked to (controlled) hypertension and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Blood pressure was measured according to the guidelines and the DEMTECT- test was used to detect MCI.
The most common risk factor was hypertension (60%). Hypertensive patients were older (56.1 and 44.7 years), had a higher BMI (28 and 24.8 kg/m), frequently physical inactive (26 and 32.4%), diabetes (9.3 and 1.3%), higher LDL (134.7 and 124.1 mg/dl), higher triglycerides (169.6 and 124.8 mg/dl) and lower HDL (57.9 and 65.5 mg/dl) compared with normotensives (P < 0.001). Controlled hypertensive patients are less common men (46.1 and 52.1%, P < 0.001), have a lower BMI (28.3 and 29.1 kg/m, P < 0.001), lower LDL (129.0 and 135.6 mg/dl, P = 0.004) and lower triglycerides (162.5 and 182.3 mg/dl, P = 0.001) compared with treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients. Antihypertensives per person (2.015; 2.017) do not differ. The prevalence of MCI is highly significantly associated with the number of risk factors. in participants without risk factors, the prevalence is 3.9%, in participants with 4 risk factors, 16.3%. In hypertensive patients, the frequency is 11.8% compared with 4.8% for normotensives (P < 0.001). The occurrence of MCI depends significantly from age, blood pressure and diabetes CONCLUSION:: The frequency of MCI is highly significantly associated with the number of cardiovascular risk factors, regardless of age. The prevalence was particularly high among hypertensive patients, which is not often described. The occurrence of MCI depends significantly from age, blood pressure and diabetes.

22440643",Vascular Risk Factors of Hippocampal Subfield Volumes in Persons without Dementia: The Medea 7T Study.,"Vascular risk factors have been associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and volume loss of the hippocampus, but the associations with subfields of the hippocampus are understudied. Knowing if vascular risk factors contribute to hippocampal subfield atrophy may improve our understanding of vascular contributions to neurodegenerative diseases.
To investigate the associations between age, sex, and vascular risk factors with hippocampal subfields volumes on 7T MRI in older persons without dementia.
From the Medea 7T study, 283 participants (67±9 years, 68% men) without dementia had 7T brain MRI and hippocampal subfield segmentation. Subfields were automatically segmented on the 3D T2-weighted 7T images with ASHS software. Using linear mixed models, we estimated adjusted associations of age, sex, and vascular risk factors with z-scores of volumes of the entorhinal cortex (ERC), subiculum (SUB), Cornu Ammonis (CA)1, CA2, CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus (DG), and tail as multivariate correlated outcomes.
Increasing age was associated with smaller volumes in all subfields, except CA4/DG. Current smoking was associated with smaller ERC and SUB volumes; moderate alcohol use with smaller CA1 and CA4/DG, obesity with smaller volumes of ERC, SUB, CA2, CA3, and tail; and diabetes mellitus with smaller SUB volume. Sex, former smoking, and hypertension were not associated with subfield volumes. When formally tested, no risk factor affected the subfield volumes differentially.
Several vascular risk factors were associated with smaller volumes of specific hippocampal subfields. However, no statistical evidence was found that subfields were differentially affected by these risk factors.","['Cornu ammonis', 'dentate gyrus', 'entorhinal cortex', 'hippocampal region', 'hippocampus', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'risk factors']",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2020-09-15,"[{'lastname': 'Blom', 'firstname': 'Kim', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Koek', 'firstname': 'Huiberdina L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Zwartbol', 'firstname': 'Maarten H T', 'initials': 'MHT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghaznawi', 'firstname': 'Rashid', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuijf', 'firstname': 'Hugo J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Witkamp', 'firstname': 'Theo D', 'initials': 'TD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hendrikse', 'firstname': 'Jeroen', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Biessels', 'firstname': 'Geert Jan', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Geerlings', 'firstname': 'Mirjam I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,"Several vascular risk factors were associated with smaller volumes of specific hippocampal subfields.

28920887",Association of Alcohol-Induced Loss of Consciousness and Overall Alcohol Consumption With Risk for Dementia.,"Evidence on alcohol consumption as a risk factor for dementia usually relates to overall consumption. The role of alcohol-induced loss of consciousness is uncertain.
To examine the risk of future dementia associated with overall alcohol consumption and alcohol-induced loss of consciousness in a population of current drinkers.
Seven cohort studies from the UK, France, Sweden, and Finland (IPD-Work consortium) including 131 415 participants were examined. At baseline (1986-2012), participants were aged 18 to 77 years, reported alcohol consumption, and were free of diagnosed dementia. Dementia was examined during a mean follow-up of 14.4 years (range, 12.3-30.1). Data analysis was conducted from November 17, 2019, to May 23, 2020.
Self-reported overall consumption and loss of consciousness due to alcohol consumption were assessed at baseline. Two thresholds were used to define heavy overall consumption: greater than 14 units (U) (UK definition) and greater than 21 U (US definition) per week.
Dementia and alcohol-related disorders to 2016 were ascertained from linked electronic health records.
Of the 131 415 participants (mean [SD] age, 43.0 [10.4] years; 80 344 [61.1%] women), 1081 individuals (0.8%) developed dementia. After adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.98-1.37) for consuming greater than 14 vs 1 to 14 U of alcohol per week and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01-1.48) for greater than 21 vs 1 to 21 U/wk. Of the 96 591 participants with data on loss of consciousness, 10 004 individuals (10.4%) reported having lost consciousness due to alcohol consumption in the past 12 months. The association between loss of consciousness and dementia was observed in men (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.77-4.63) and women (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.34-3.25) during the first 10 years of follow-up (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.78-4.15), after excluding the first 10 years of follow-up (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.16-2.99), and for early-onset (<65 y: HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.46-3.34) and late-onset (≥65 y: HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.38-3.66) dementia, Alzheimer disease (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.28-3.07), and dementia with features of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.86-9.37). The association with dementia was not explained by 14 other alcohol-related conditions. With moderate drinkers (1-14 U/wk) who had not lost consciousness as the reference group, the HR for dementia was twice as high in participants who reported having lost consciousness, whether their mean weekly consumption was moderate (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.42-3.37) or heavy (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.57-3.54).
The findings of this study suggest that alcohol-induced loss of consciousness, irrespective of overall alcohol consumption, is associated with a subsequent increase in the risk of dementia.",[],JAMA

32343351",Impact of benzodiazepine consumption reduction on future burden of dementia.,"Dementia is a major public health issue worldwide and chronic use of benzodiazepine, which is very frequent in northern countries, was found to be a risk factor of dementia. This work aims at evaluating the impact of a reduction in chronic use of benzodiazepine on the future burden of dementia in France. Using estimations of dementia incidence and of benzodiazepine use and nation-wide projections of mortality and population sizes, a Monte Carlo approach based on an illness-death model provided projections of several indicators of dementia burden. With no change in benzodiazepine consumption, the prevalence of dementia between age 65 and 99 in France in 2040 was estimated at 2.16 millions (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-2.38), with a life expectancy without dementia at 65 years equal to 25.0 years (24.7-25.3) for women and 23.8 years (23.5-24.2) for men. Assuming a disappearance of chronic use of benzodiazepine in 2020, the prevalence would be reduced by about 6.6% in 2040 and the life expectancy without dementia would increase by 0.99 (0.93-1.06) year among women and 0.56 (0.50-0.62) among men. To conclude, a modest but significant reduction in future dementia burden could be obtained by applying current recommendation for duration of benzodiazepine use.",[],Scientific reports,2020-09-06,"[{'lastname': 'Jacqmin-Gadda', 'firstname': 'Hélène', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'INSERM, ISPED, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, UMR 1219, Univ.

21852658","Sex, race, and risk of dementia diagnosis after traumatic brain injury among older veterans.","To investigate whether sex and race differences exist in dementia diagnosis risk associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) among older veterans.
Using Fine-Gray regression models, we investigated incident dementia diagnosis risk with TBI exposure by sex and race.
After the exclusion of baseline prevalent dementia, the final sample (all veterans ≥55 years of age diagnosed with TBI during the 2001-2015 study period and a random sample of all veterans receiving Veterans Health Administration care) included nearly 1 million veterans (4.3% female; 81.8% White, 11.5% Black, and 1.25% Hispanic), 96,178 with TBI and 903,462 without TBI. Compared to those without TBI, Hispanic veterans with TBI were almost 2 times more likely (17.0% vs 10.3%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-2.01), Black veterans with TBI were >2 times more likely (11.2% vs 6.4%; HR 2.15, 95% CI 2.02-2.30), and White veterans with TBI were nearly 3 times more likely to receive a dementia diagnosis (12.0% vs 5.9%; HR 2.71, 95% CI 2.64-2.77). A significant interaction between TBI and race for dementia diagnosis was observed (
In this large, nationwide cohort of older veterans, all race groups with TBI had increased risk of dementia diagnosis, but there was an interaction effect such that White veterans were at greatest risk for dementia after TBI. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms for this discrepancy. Differences in dementia diagnosis risk for men and women after TBI were significant but small, and male and female veterans had similarly high risks of dementia diagnosis after TBI.",[],Neurology,2020-09-06,"[{'lastname': 'Kornblith', 'firstname': 'Erica', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'From the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System (E.K., C.B.P., F.X., T.N.-A., K.Y.); Department of Neurology (B.P.), Duke University, Durham, NC; and Departments of Psychiatry (E.K., T.N.-A., K.Y.), Neurology (K.Y.), and Epidemiology and Biostatistics (K.Y.), University of California San Francisco. erica.kornblith@va.gov.'}, {'lastname': 'Peltz', 'firstname': 'Carrie B', 'initials': 'CB', 'affiliation': 'From the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System (E.K., C.B.P., F.X., T.N.-A., K.Y.); Department of Neurology (B.P.), Duke University, Durham, NC; and Departments of Psychiatry (E.K., T.N.-A., K.Y.), Neurology (K.Y.), and Epidemiology and Biostatistics (K.Y.), University of California San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Xia', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'From the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System (E.K., C.B.P., F.X., T.N.-A., K.Y.); Department of Neurology (B.P.), Duke University, Durham, NC; and Departments of Psychiatry (E.K., T.N.-A., K.Y.), Neurology (K.Y.), and Epidemiology and Biostatistics (K.Y.), University of California San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Plassman', 'firstname': 'Brenda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'From the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System (E.K., C.B.P., F.X., T.N.-A., K.Y.); Department of Neurology (B.P.), Duke University, Durham, NC; and Departments of Psychiatry (E.K., T.N.-A., K.Y.), Neurology (K.Y.), and Epidemiology and Biostatistics (K.Y.), University of California San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Novakovic-Apopain', 'firstname': 'Tatjana', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'From the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System (E.K., C.B.P., F.X., T.N.-A., K.Y.); Department of Neurology (B.P.), Duke University, Durham, NC; and Departments of Psychiatry (E.K., T.N.-A., K.Y.), Neurology (K.Y.), and Epidemiology and Biostatistics (K.Y.), University of California San Francisco.'}, {'lastname': 'Yaffe', 'firstname': 'Kristine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'From the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System (E.K., C.B.P., F.X., T.N.-A., K.Y.); Department of Neurology (B.P.), Duke University, Durham, NC; and Departments of Psychiatry (E.K., T.N.-A., K.Y.), Neurology (K.Y.), and Epidemiology and Biostatistics (K.Y.), University of California San Francisco.'}]",,,"After the exclusion of baseline prevalent dementia, the final sample (all veterans ≥55 years of age diagnosed with TBI during the 2001-2015 study period and a random sample of all veterans receiving Veterans Health Administration care) included nearly 1 million veterans (4.3% female; 81.8% White, 11.5% Black, and 1.25% Hispanic), 96,178 with TBI and 903,462 without TBI.

499,32876965,Does serum vitamin D level affect the association between cardiovascular health and cognition? Results of the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Etiology Research Center (CMERC) study.,"Few studies have assessed the role of vitamin D in the association between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive function. Here, the aim was to investigate the association between cardiovascular health (CVH) and cognitive function according to vitamin D level in a middle-aged Korean population.
This cross-sectional study included 840 men and 1811 women (mean age 57.2 years) from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Etiology Research Center study baseline enrolment (2013-2018). Life's Simple 7 tools from the American Heart Association were used to assess CVH. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Estimation for Dementia Screening (MMSE-DS), and the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was measured.
In the adjusted generalized linear regression models, no significant association between a high Life's Simple 7 score (4-7 metric at optimal level) and MMSE-DS score (β = 0.01, P = 0.93) was found. Amongst men with a high vitamin D level, the high Life's Simple 7 score group showed a significantly higher MMSE-DS score (β = 0.48, P = 0.03). However, amongst men in the low vitamin D group, the association was opposite with no statistical significance (β = -0.23, P = 0.08). In women, the results were similar, but both strata according to vitamin D level showed no statistical significance.
Our findings suggest that vitamin D is an effect modifier in the association between CVH and cognition, especially in men.","['cardiovascular health', 'cognitive disorders and dementia', 'epidemiology']",European journal of neurology,2020-09-03,"[{'lastname': 'Jeon', 'firstname': 'Y J', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Yonsei University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'S J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Yonsei University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.\nDepartment of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.
